             The Heidelberg Catechism
Introduction
   The Heidelberg Catechism (1563) was composed in the city of Heidelberg,
Germany, at the request of Elector Frederick III, who ruled the province of
the Palatinate from 1559 to 1576. The new catechism was intended as a tool
for teaching young people, a guide for preaching in the provincial churches,
and a form of confessional unity among the several Protestant factions in
the Palatinate. An old tradition credits Zacharias Ursinus and Caspar Olevia-
nus with being the coauthors of the catechism, but the project was actually
the work of a team of ministers and university theologians under the watch-
ful eye of Frederick himself. Ursinus probably served as the primary writer
on the team, and Olevianus had a lesser role. The catechism was approved
by a synod in Heidelberg in January 1563. A second and third German edi-
tion, each with small additions, as well as a Latin translation were published
the same year in Heidelberg. The third edition was included in the Palati-
nate Church Order of November 15, 1563, at which time the catechism was
divided into fifty-two sections or Lord’s Days, so that one Lord’s Day could
be explained in an afternoon worship service each Sunday of the year.
   The Synod of Dort approved the Heidelberg Catechism in 1619, and it
soon became the most ecumenical of the Reformed catechisms and confes-
sions. It has been translated into many European, Asian, and African lan-
guages and is still the most widely used and warmly praised catechism of the
Reformation period.
   Most of the footnoted biblical references in this translation of the cate-
chism were included in the early German and Latin editions, but the precise
selection was approved by Synod 1975 of the Christian Reformed Church.


LORD’S DAY 1

1 Q. What is your only comfort
		   in life and in death?
  A. That I am not my own,1
		   but belong—
			 body and soul,
			 in life and in death—2
		   to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.3

			        He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood,4
			        and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.5
			        He also watches over me in such a way6
			        that not a hair can fall from my head
			        without the will of my Father in heaven;7
			        in fact, all things must work together for my salvation.8


                                                                          69
		          Because I belong to him,
		          Christ, by his Holy Spirit,
		          assures me of eternal life9
		          and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready
		          from now on to live for him.10

2 Q. What must you know to
		   live and die in the joy of this comfort?
  A. Three things:
			 first, how great my sin and misery are;1
			 second, how I am set free from all my sins and misery;2
			 third, how I am to thank God for such deliverance.3

Part I: Misery

LORD’S DAY 2

3        Q. How do you come to know your misery?
         A. The law of God tells me.1
1
    Rom. 3:20; 7:7-25

4        Q. What does God’s law require of us?
         A. Christ teaches us this in summary in Matthew 22:37-40:

			 “‘You shall love the Lord your God
			 with all your heart,
			 and with all your soul,
			 and with all your mind.’1
			 This is the greatest and first commandment.

			“And a second is like it:
			‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’2




    70
			“On these two commandments hang
			all the law and the prophets.”

1
    Deut. 6:5
2
    Lev. 19:18


5 Q.             Can you live up to all this perfectly?
  A.             No.1
		               I have a natural tendency
		               to hate God and my neighbor.2

LORD’S DAY 3

6 Q. Did God create people
		   so wicked and perverse?
  A. No.
		   God created them good1 and in his own image,2
			 that is, in true righteousness and holiness,3
		   so that they might
			     truly know God their creator,4
			 love him with all their heart,
			 and live with God in eternal happiness,
		   to praise and glorify him.5

3
  Eph. 4:24
4
  Col. 3:10
5
  Ps. 8


7 Q. Then where does this corrupt human nature come from?
  A. The fall and disobedience of our first parents,
			 Adam and Eve, in Paradise.1
		   This fall has so poisoned our nature2
			 that we are all conceived and born
			    in a sinful condition.3

1

8 Q.           But are we so corrupt
		             that we are totally unable to do any good
		             and inclined toward all evil?
  A.           Yes,1 unless we are born again
		             by the Spirit of God.2

1
    Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Job 14:4; Isa. 53:6
2
    John 3:3-5



LORD’S DAY 4

9 Q. But doesn’t God do us an injustice
		   by requiring in his law
		   what we are unable to do?
  A. No, God created human beings with the ability to keep the law.1
		   They, however, provoked by the devil,2
			    in willful disobedience,3
			 robbed themselves and all their descendants of these gifts.4
1
  Gen. 1:31; Eph. 4:24
2
  Gen. 3:13; John 8:44
3
  Gen. 3:6
4
  Rom. 5:12, 18, 19

10 Q. Does God permit
		    such disobedience and rebellion
		    to go unpunished?
   A. Certainly not.
		    God is terribly angry
			      with the sin we are born with
			 as well as the sins we personally commit.

		 As a just judge,
		 God will punish them both now and in eternity,1
		 having declared:
			 “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey
			  all the things written in the book of the law.”2
1
    Ex. 34:7; Ps. 5:4-6; Nah. 1:2; Rom. 1:18; Eph. 5:6; Heb. 9:27
2
    Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26




    72
11Q. But isn’t God also merciful?
  A. God is certainly merciful,1
		   but also just.2
		   God’s justice demands
			 that sin, committed against his supreme majesty,
			 be punished with the supreme penalty—
			 eternal punishment of body and soul.3

1
  Ex. 34:6-7; Ps. 103:8-9
2
  Ex. 34:7; Deut. 7:9-11; Ps. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:30-31
3
  Matt. 25:35-46



Part II: Deliverance

LORD’S DAY 5

12 Q. According to God’s righteous judgment
		    we deserve punishment
		    both now and in eternity:
		    how then can we escape this punishment
		    and return to God’s favor?
   A. God requires that his justice be satisfied.1
		    Therefore the claims of this justice
		    must be paid in full,
		    either by ourselves or by another.2
1
    Ex. 23:7; Rom. 2:1-11
2
    Isa. 53:11; Rom. 8:3-4


13Q. Can we make this payment ourselves?
  A. Certainly not.
		   Actually, we increase our debt every day.1

1
    Matt. 6:12; Rom. 2:4-5


14 Q. Can another creature—any at all—
		    pay this debt for us?
   A. No.
		    To begin with,
			 God will not punish any other creature
			 for what a human is guilty of.1
		    Furthermore,
			 no mere creature can bear the weight
			 of God’s eternal wrath against sin
			and deliver others from it.2

1
    Ezek. 18:4, 20; Heb. 2:14-18
2
    Ps. 49:7-9; 130:3



                                                       73
15 Q. What kind of mediator and deliverer
		    should we look for then?
   A. One who is a true1 and righteous2 human,
			 yet more powerful than all creatures,
			 that is, one who is also true God.3

1
  Rom. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:17
2
  Isa. 53:9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26
3
  Isa. 7:14; 9:6; Jer. 23:6; John 1:1



LORD’S DAY 6

16Q. Why must the mediator be a true and righteous human?
  A. God’s justice demands
			    that human nature, which has sinned,
			    must pay for sin;1
			 but a sinful human could never pay for others.2

1
    Rom. 5:12, 15; 1 Cor. 15:21; Heb. 2:14-16
2
    Heb. 7:26-27; 1 Pet. 3:18


17Q. Why must the mediator also be true God?
  A. So that the mediator,
			 by the power of his divinity,
		   might bear the weight of God’s wrath in his humanity
			 and earn for us
			 and restore to us
		   righteousness and life.1

1
    Isa. 53; John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:21


18 Q. Then who is this mediator—
		    true God and at the same time
		    a true and righteous human?
   A. Our Lord Jesus Christ,1
			 who was given to us
			to completely deliver us
			 and make us right with God.2

1
    Matt. 1:21-23; Luke 2:11; 1 Tim. 2:5
2
    1 Cor. 1:30


19Q. How do you come to know this?
  A. The holy gospel tells me.
			 God began to reveal the gospel already in Paradise;1
			 later God proclaimed it
				 by the holy patriarchs2 and prophets3



    74
			and foreshadowed it
				 by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law;4
			 and finally God fulfilled it
				 through his own beloved Son.5

LORD’S DAY 7

20 Q. Are all people then saved through Christ
		    just as they were lost through Adam?
   A. No.
		    Only those are saved
		who through true faith
			 are grafted into Christ
			 and accept all his benefits.1

1
    Matt. 7:14; John 3:16, 18, 36; Rom. 11:16-21


21Q. What is true faith?
  A. True faith is
		   not only a sure knowledge by which I hold as true
			      all that God has revealed to us in Scripture;1
		   it is also a wholehearted trust,2
			      which the Holy Spirit creates in me3 by the gospel,4
			that God has freely granted,
				not only to others but to me also,5
					forgiveness of sins,
					eternal righteousness,
					and salvation.6
			      These are gifts of sheer grace,
			      granted solely by Christ’s merit.7

22Q. What then must a Christian believe?
  A. All that is promised us in the gospel,1
			     a summary of which is taught us
			 in the articles of our universal
			and undisputed Christian faith.
1
    Matt. 28:18-20; John 20:30-31


23Q. What are these articles?
  A. I believe in God, the Father almighty,
			 creator of heaven and earth.

		 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord,
			 who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
			 and born of the virgin Mary.
			 He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
			 was crucified, died, and was buried;
			 he descended to hell.
			 The third day he rose again from the dead.
			 He ascended to heaven
			 and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
			 From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

		 I believe in the Holy Spirit,
			 the holy catholic church,
			 the communion of saints,
			 the forgiveness of sins,
			 the resurrection of the body,
			 and the life everlasting. Amen.


LORD’S DAY 8

24Q. How are these articles divided?
  A. Into three parts:
			 God the Father and our creation;
			 God the Son and our deliverance;
			 and God the Holy Spirit and our sanctification.

25 Q. Since there is only one divine being,1
		    why do you speak of three:
		    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?
   A. Because that is how
			 God has revealed himself in his Word:2
			 these three distinct persons
			 are one, true, eternal God.

God the Father

LORD’S DAY 9

26 Q. What do you believe when you say,
		    “I believe in God, the Father almighty,
		    creator of heaven and earth”?
   A. That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
			 who out of nothing created heaven and earth
				 and everything in them,1
			 who still upholds and rules them
				 by his eternal counsel and providence,2
		    is my God and Father
			 because of Christ the Son.3

		 I trust God so much that I do not doubt
			 he will provide
				 whatever I need
				 for body and soul,4
			 and will turn to my good
				 whatever adversity he sends upon me
				 in this sad world.5

		          God is able to do this because he is almighty God6
		          and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.7

27 Q. What do you understand
		    by the providence of God?
   A. The almighty and ever present power of God1
		 by which God upholds, as with his hand,
				heaven
				and earth
				 and all creatures,2
			 and so rules them that
				 leaf and blade,
				 rain and drought,

28 Q. How does the knowledge
		    of God’s creation and providence help us?
   A. We can be patient when things go against us,1
			 thankful when things go well,2
			 and for the future we can have
			 good confidence in our faithful God and Father
			 that nothing in creation will separate us from his love.3
			      For all creatures are so completely in God’s hand
				 that without his will
				 they can neither move nor be moved.4

God the Son

LORD’S DAY 11

29 Q. Why is the Son of God called “Jesus,”
		    meaning “savior”?
   A. Because he saves us from our sins,1
			 and because salvation should not be sought
			     and cannot be found in anyone else.2

30 Q. Do those who look for
		    their salvation in saints,
		    in themselves, or elsewhere
		    really believe in the only savior Jesus?
   A. No.
		    Although they boast of being his,
		    by their actions they deny
		    the only savior, Jesus.1

		 Either Jesus is not a perfect savior,
		 or those who in true faith accept this savior
		 have in him all they need for their salvation.2

LORD’S DAY 12

31 Q. Why is he called “Christ,”
		    meaning “anointed”?
   A. Because he has been ordained by God the Father
		    and has been anointed with the Holy Spirit1
			 to be
			 our chief prophet and teacher2
				who fully reveals to us
				 the secret counsel and will of God concerning our deliverance;3
			 our only high priest4
				who has delivered us by the one sacrifice of his body,5
				 and who continually pleads our cause with the Father;6
			 and our eternal king7
				 who governs us by his Word and Spirit,
				 and who guards us and keeps us

32Q. But why are you called a Christian?
  A. Because by faith I am a member of Christ1
		   and so I share in his anointing.2
			 I am anointed
			 to confess his name,3
			 to present myself to him as a living sacrifice of thanks,4
			 to strive with a free conscience against sin and the devil
				 in this life,5
			 and afterward to reign with Christ
				 over all creation
				for eternity.6

LORD’S DAY 13

33 Q. Why is he called God’s “only begotten Son”
		    when we also are God’s children?
   A. Because Christ alone is the eternal, natural Son of God.1
		    We, however, are adopted children of God—
			 adopted by grace through Christ.2

    John 1:12; Rom. 8:14-17; Eph. 1:5-6


34Q. Why do you call him “our Lord”?
  A. Because—
			 not with gold or silver,
			 but with his precious blood—1
		   he has set us free
			 from sin and from the tyranny of the devil,2
		   and has bought us,
			 body and soul,
		   to be his very own.3

35 Q. What does it mean that he
		    “was conceived by the Holy Spirit
		    and born of the virgin Mary”?
   A. That the eternal Son of God,
			 who is and remains
			 true and eternal God,1
		    took to himself,
			 through the working of the Holy Spirit,2
			 from the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary,3
		    a truly human nature
			 so that he might also become David’s true descendant,4
			 like his brothers and sisters in every way5
				 except for sin.6

36 Q. How does the holy conception and birth of Christ
		    benefit you?
   A. He is our mediator1
		    and, in God’s sight,
		    he covers with his innocence and perfect holiness
		    my sinfulness in which I was conceived.2

LORD’S DAY 15

37 Q. What do you understand
		    by the word “suffered”?
   A. That during his whole life on earth,
		    but especially at the end,
		    Christ sustained
			 in body and soul
			the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race.1




                                                                        81
		 This he did in order that,
			 by his suffering as the only atoning sacrifice,2
			 he might deliver us, body and soul,
				 from eternal condemnation,3
			 and gain for us
				God’s grace,
				righteousness,
				 and eternal life.4

4
  John 3:16; Rom. 3:24-26


38 Q. Why did he suffer
		    “under Pontius Pilate” as judge?
   A. So that he,
			 though innocent,
		    might be condemned by an earthly judge,1
		    and so free us from the severe judgment of God
			 that was to fall on us.2

    Luke 23:13-24; John 19:4, 12-16
2
    Isa. 53:4-5; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13


39 Q. Is it significant that he was “crucified”
		    instead of dying some other way?
   A. Yes.
		    By this I am convinced
		    that he shouldered the curse
		    which lay on me,
		    since death by crucifixion was cursed by God.1

    82
LORD’S DAY 16

40
 Q. Why did Christ have to suffer death?
 A. Because God’s justice and truth require it: 1
		  nothing else could pay for our sins
		  except the death of the Son of God.2

1
    Gen. 2:17
2
    Rom. 8:3-4; Phil. 2:8; Heb. 2:9


41Q. Why was he “buried”?
  A. His burial testifies
		   that he really died.1

1
    Isa. 53:9; John 19:38-42; Acts 13:29; 1 Cor. 15:3-4


42 Q.          Since Christ has died for us,
		             why do we still have to die?
   A.          Our death does not pay the debt of our sins.1
		             Rather, it puts an end to our sinning
		             and is our entrance into eternal life.2

    Ps. 49:7
2
    John 5:24; Phil. 1:21-23; 1 Thess. 5:9-10


43 Q. What further benefit do we receive
		    from Christ’s sacrifice and death on the cross?
   A. By Christ’s power
		    our old selves are crucified, put to death, and buried with him,1
		    so that the evil desires of the flesh
			 may no longer rule us,2
		    but that instead we may offer ourselves
			as a sacrifice of gratitude to him.3

3
  Rom. 12:1; Eph. 5:1-2


44 Q. Why does the creed add,
		    “He descended to hell”?
   A. To assure me during attacks of deepest dread and temptation
		    that Christ my Lord,
			 by suffering unspeakable anguish, pain, and terror of soul,
				on the cross but also earlier,
			 has delivered me from hellish anguish and torment.1

LORD’S DAY 17

45 Q. How does Christ’s resurrection
		    benefit us?
   A. First, by his resurrection he has overcome death,
			 so that he might make us share in the righteousness
			he obtained for us by his death.1

		 Second, by his power we too
			are already raised to a new life.2

		 Third, Christ’s resurrection

LORD’S DAY 18

46 Q. What do you mean by saying,
		    “He ascended to heaven”?
   A. That Christ,
			     while his disciples watched,
		    was taken up from the earth into heaven1
		    and remains there on our behalf2
		    until he comes again
			 to judge the living and the dead.3

3
  Acts 1:11


47 Q. But isn’t Christ with us
		    until the end of the world
		    as he promised us?1
   A. Christ is true human and true God.
			 In his human nature Christ is not now on earth;2
			 but in his divinity, majesty, grace, and Spirit
			      he is never absent from us.3

    84
48 Q. If his humanity is not present
		    wherever his divinity is,
		    then aren’t the two natures of Christ
		    separated from each other?
   A. Certainly not.
		    Since divinity
			 is not limited
			 and is present everywhere,1
		    it is evident that
			 Christ’s divinity is surely beyond the bounds of
				 the humanity that has been taken on,
			 but at the same time his divinity is in
			 and remains personally united to
				his humanity.2

2
    John 1:14; 3:13; Col. 2:9


49 Q. How does Christ’s ascension to heaven
		    benefit us?
   A. First, he is our advocate
			 in heaven
			 in the presence of his Father.1

		 Second, we have our own flesh in heaven
			  as a sure pledge that Christ our head
			 will also take us, his members,
			  up to himself.2

		 Third, he sends his Spirit to us on earth
			 as a corresponding pledge.3
			 By the Spirit’s power
				we seek not earthly things
				 but the things above, where Christ is,

LORD’S DAY 19

50 Q. Why the next words:
		    “and is seated at the right hand of God”?
   A. Because Christ ascended to heaven
		    to show there that he is head of his church,1

		    benefit us?
   A. First, through his Holy Spirit
			 he pours out gifts from heaven

52 Q. How does Christ’s return
		    “to judge the living and the dead”
		    comfort you?
   A. In all distress and persecution,
		    with uplifted head,
		    I confidently await the very judge
			 who has already offered himself to the judgment of God
			      in my place and removed the whole curse from me.1

   A. I believe that the Son of God

55 Q.       What do you understand by

   A.       First, that believers one and all,

   A. I believe that God,
			 because of Christ’s satisfaction,
		    will no longer remember

   A. Not only will my soul

		 Even though my conscience accuses me

			  and of still being inclined toward all evil,3
		nevertheless,

61 Q. Why do you say that
		    through faith alone
		    you are righteous?
   A. Not because I please God
			       by the worthiness of my faith.
		    It is because only Christ’s satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness
			       make me righteous before God,1

62 Q. Why can’t our good works
		    be our righteousness before God,
		    or at least a part of our righteousness?
   A. Because the righteousness
		    which can pass God’s judgment
			 must be entirely perfect
			 and must in every way measure up to the divine law.1
		    But even our best works in this life
			      are imperfect

63 Q. How can our good works
		    be said to merit nothing
		    when God promises to reward them
		    in this life and the next?1
   A. This reward is not earned;

   A. No.
		    It is impossible
			 for those grafted into Christ through true faith
		    not to produce fruits of gratitude.1

LORD’S DAY 25

65 Q. It is through faith alone

		    where then does that faith come from?
   A. The Holy Spirit produces it in our hearts1

			      by the use of the holy sacraments.3

66Q. What are sacraments?
  A. Sacraments are visible, holy signs and seals.
		   They were instituted by God so that
			 by our use of them
		   he might make us understand more clearly
			 the promise of the gospel,
		   and seal that promise.1




                                                       91
		 And this is God’s gospel promise:
			  to grant us forgiveness of sins and eternal life
				by grace
				 because of Christ’s one sacrifice
				accomplished on the cross.2

67 Q. Are both the word and the sacraments then
		    intended to focus our faith
		    on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross
		    as the only ground of our salvation?
   A. Yes!
		    In the gospel the Holy Spirit teaches us
		and by the holy sacraments confirms
			 that our entire salvation
			 rests on Christ’s one sacrifice for us on the cross.1

    Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 11:26; Gal. 3:27


68 Q. How many sacraments
		    did Christ institute in the New Testament?
   A. Two: holy baptism and the holy supper.1

Holy Baptism

LORD’S DAY 26

69 Q. How does holy baptism
		    remind and assure you
		    that Christ’s one sacrifice on the cross
		    benefits you personally?
   A. In this way:
		    Christ instituted this outward washing1
		and with it promised that,
			 as surely as water washes away the dirt from the body,
			 so certainly his blood and his Spirit
			wash away my soul’s impurity,
				that is, all my sins.2

    Acts 2:38

    Matt. 3:11; Rom. 6:3-10; 1 Pet. 3:21




    92
70 Q. What does it mean
		    to be washed with Christ’s blood and Spirit?
   A. To be washed with Christ’s blood means
			 that God, by grace, has forgiven our sins
				 because of Christ’s blood
				 poured out for us in his sacrifice on the cross.1

		 To be washed with Christ’s Spirit means
			 that the Holy Spirit has renewed
			  and sanctified us to be members of Christ,
				 so that more and more
					we become dead to sin
					and live holy and blameless lives.2

71 Q.          Where does Christ promise
		             that we are washed with his blood and Spirit
		             as surely as we are washed
		             with the water of baptism?
   A.          In the institution of baptism, where he says:

			“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
			 baptizing them in the name of the Father
			 and of the Son
			 and of the Holy Spirit.”1

			“The one who believes and is baptized will be saved;
			but the one who does not believe will be condemned.”2

			 This promise is repeated when Scripture calls baptism
				“the water of rebirth”3 and
				 the washing away of sins.4

LORD’S DAY 27

72 Q.          Does this outward washing with water
		             itself wash away sins?
   A.          No, only Jesus Christ’s blood and the Holy Spirit
		             cleanse us from all sins.1

1
    Matt. 3:11; 1 Pet. 3:21; 1 John 1:7



                                                                      93
73 Q. Why then does the Holy Spirit call baptism
		the water of rebirth and
		    the washing away of sins?
   A. God has good reason for these words.
		    To begin with, God wants to teach us that
			 the blood and Spirit of Christ take away our sins
			 just as water removes dirt from the body.1

		 But more important,
		 God wants to assure us, by this divine pledge and sign,
			 that we are as truly washed of our sins spiritually
			 as our bodies are washed with water physically.2

2
    Acts 2:38; Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 3:27


74Q. Should infants also be baptized?
  A. Yes.
		   Infants as well as adults
			are included in God’s covenant and people,1
		   and they, no less than adults, are promised
			     deliverance from sin through Christ’s blood
			 and the Holy Spirit who produces faith.2

		 Therefore, by baptism, the sign of the covenant,
			  they too should be incorporated into the Christian church
			  and distinguished from the children
				of unbelievers.3
		 This was done in the Old Testament by circumcision,4
			 which was replaced in the New Testament by baptism.5

The Holy Supper of Jesus Christ

LORD’S DAY 28

75 Q. How does the holy supper
		    remind and assure you
		    that you share in
		    Christ’s one sacrifice on the cross
		    and in all his benefits?
   A. In this way:
		    Christ has commanded me and all believers
		    to eat this broken bread and to drink this cup
		    in remembrance of him.
		    With this command come these promises:1

		First,
			 as surely as I see with my eyes
				 the bread of the Lord broken for me
				 and the cup shared with me,
			 so surely
				 his body was offered and broken for me
				 and his blood poured out for me
					on the cross.

		Second,
			 as surely as
				 I receive from the hand of the one who serves,
				 and taste with my mouth
					 the bread and cup of the Lord,
					 given me as sure signs of Christ’s body and blood,
			 so surely
				 he nourishes and refreshes my soul for eternal life
				 with his crucified body and poured-out blood.

1
    Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-25


76 Q. What does it mean
		    to eat the crucified body of Christ
		    and to drink his poured-out blood?
   A. It means
			 to accept with a believing heart
				 the entire suffering and death of Christ
			      and thereby
				 to receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life.1




                                                                    95
		 But it means more.
			  Through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us,
			  we are united more and more to Christ’s blessed body.2
				 And so, although he is in heaven3 and we are on earth,
				 we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.4
				 And we forever live on and are governed by one Spirit,
					as the members of our body are by one soul.5

77 Q.       Where does Christ promise
		          to nourish and refresh believers
		          with his body and blood
		          as surely as
		          they eat this broken bread
		          and drink this cup?
   A.       In the institution of the Lord’s Supper:

			“The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed
			took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks,
			 he broke it and said,
				‘This is my body that is [broken]* for you.
				Do this in remembrance of me.’
			 In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying,
				 ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
				Do this, as often as you drink it,
				 in remembrance of me.’
			For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
			 you proclaim the Lord’s death
			 until he comes.”1

		          This promise is repeated by Paul in these words:

			 “The cup of blessing that we bless,
				is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?
			 The bread that we break,
				is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
			 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body,
			 for we all partake of the one bread.”2

LORD’S DAY 29

78 Q. Do the bread and wine become
		    the real body and blood of Christ?
   A. No.
		    Just as the water of baptism
			 is not changed into Christ’s blood
			 and does not itself wash away sins
			 but is simply a divine sign and assurance1 of these things,
		    so too the holy bread of the Lord’s Supper
			      does not become the actual body of Christ,2
			 even though it is called the body of Christ3
				 in keeping with the nature and language of sacraments.4

79 Q. Why then does Christ call
		    the bread his body
		    and the cup his blood,
			 or the new covenant in his blood,
		    and Paul use the words,
		    a sharing in Christ’s body and blood?
   A. Christ has good reason for these words.
		    He wants to teach us that
			      just as bread and wine nourish the temporal life,
			 so too his crucified body and poured-out blood
			      are the true food and drink of our souls for eternal life.1

		 But more important,
		 he wants to assure us, by this visible sign and pledge,
			 that we, through the Holy Spirit’s work,
				 share in his true body and blood
				 as surely as our mouths
				 receive these holy signs in his remembrance,2
			 and that all of his suffering and obedience
				 are as definitely ours
				 as if we personally
				 had suffered and made satisfaction for our sins.3

LORD’S DAY 30

80* Q. How does the Lord’s Supper
		     differ from the Roman Catholic Mass?
    A. The Lord’s Supper declares to us
			that all our sins are completely forgiven
			 through the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
			 which he himself accomplished on the cross once for all.1
		     It also declares to us
			 that the Holy Spirit grafts us into Christ,2
			 who with his true body
			 is now in heaven at the right hand of the Father3
			 where he wants us to worship him.4

		[But the Mass teaches
			 that the living and the dead
			 do not have their sins forgiven
			 through the suffering of Christ
			 unless Christ is still offered for them daily by the priests.
		 It also teaches
			 that Christ is bodily present
			   under the form of bread and wine
			 where Christ is therefore to be worshiped.
		 Thus the Mass is basically
			 nothing but a denial
			 of the one sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ
			 and a condemnable idolatry.]**

form in the second edition. The translation here given is of the expanded text of the third edition.
**In response to a mandate from Synod 1998, the Christian Reformed Church’s Interchurch Relations
Committee conducted a study of Q&A 80 and the Roman Catholic Mass. Based on this study, Synod
2004 declared that “Q&A 80 can no longer be held in its current form as part of our confession.”
Synod 2006 directed that Q&A 80 remain in the CRC’s text of the Heidelberg Catechism but that the
last three paragraphs be placed in brackets to indicate that they do not accurately reflect the official
teaching and practice of today’s Roman Catholic Church and are no longer confessionally binding
on members of the CRC.
    The Reformed Church in America retains the original full text, choosing to recognize that the
catechism was written within a historical context which may not accurately describe the Roman
Catholic Church’s current stance.

81 Q. Who should come

			 that their sins are pardoned
			 and that their remaining weakness is covered
				 by the suffering and death of Christ,
		    and who also desire more and more
			 to strengthen their faith
			 and to lead a better life.

		             Hypocrites and those who are unrepentant, however,

   A. No, that would dishonor God’s covenant
		    and bring down God’s wrath upon the entire congregation.1
		    Therefore, according to the instruction of Christ
				 and his apostles,
			 the Christian church is duty-bound to exclude such people,

83Q. What are the keys of the kingdom?
  A. The preaching of the holy gospel
		   and Christian discipline toward repentance.
		   Both of them

84 Q. How does preaching the holy gospel
		    open and close the kingdom of heaven?
   A. According to the command of Christ:

		 The kingdom of heaven is opened
		 by proclaiming and publicly declaring
			  to all believers, each and every one, that,
			 as often as they accept the gospel promise in true faith,
			 God, because of Christ’s merit,
			 truly forgives all their sins.

		 The kingdom of heaven is closed, however,
		 by proclaiming and publicly declaring
			 to unbelievers and hypocrites that,
			 as long as they do not repent,
			the wrath of God and eternal condemnation
			 rest on them.

		            God’s judgment, both in this life and in the life to come,
		            is based on this gospel testimony.1

85 Q. How is the kingdom of heaven
		    closed and opened by Christian discipline?
   A. According to the command of Christ:

		 Those who, though called Christians,
			  profess unchristian teachings or live unchristian lives,
		 and who after repeated personal and loving admonitions,
			  refuse to abandon their errors and evil ways,
		 and who after being reported to the church, that is,
				to those ordained by the church for that purpose,
			  fail to respond also to the church’s admonitions—
		 such persons the church excludes
				from the Christian community
			 by withholding the sacraments from them,
		and God also excludes them from the kingdom of Christ.1

		 Such persons,
			   when promising and demonstrating genuine reform,
		 are received again
			 as members of Christ
			and of his church.2

86 Q. Since we have been delivered
		    from our misery
		    by grace through Christ
		    without any merit of our own,
		why then should we do good works?
   A. Because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood,
		    is also restoring us by his Spirit into his image,
			 so that with our whole lives
				 we may show that we are thankful to God
					for his benefits,1
			 so that he may be praised through us,2
			 so that we may be assured of our faith by its fruits,3
			 and so that by our godly living
				 our neighbors may be won over to Christ.4

The Ten Commandments

LORD’S DAY 34

92        Q. What is God’s law?
          A. God spoke all these words:

  THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
		   “I am the Lord your God,
			 who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
			 out of the house of slavery;
		   you shall have no other gods before me.”

 THE SECOND COMMANDMENT
		  “You shall not make for yourself an idol,
			   whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above,
			or that is on the earth beneath,
			or that is in the water under the earth.
    102
		 You shall not bow down to them or worship them;
			 for I the Lord your God am a jealous God,
			 punishing children for the iniquity of parents,
				 to the third and the fourth generation
				 of those who reject me,
			 but showing love to the thousandth generation of those
				 who love me and keep my commandments.”

  THE THIRD COMMANDMENT
		   “You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God,
			 for the Lord will not acquit anyone
			 who misuses his name.”

  THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
		   “Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.
		   Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
		   But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God;
		   you shall not do any work—
			     you, your son or your daughter,
			     your male or female slave,
			     your livestock,
			     or the alien resident in your towns.
		   For in six days the Lord made
			     heaven and earth, the sea,
			 and all that is in them,
		   but rested the seventh day;
		   therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day
		and consecrated it.”

  THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT
		   “Honor your father and your mother,
			 so that your days may be long
			 in the land that the Lord your God is giving to you.”

 THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT
		  “You shall not murder.”

 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT
		  “You shall not commit adultery.”

 THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT
		  “You shall not steal.”

  THE NINTH COMMANDMENT

  THE TENTH COMMANDMENT
		   “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house;
		   you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,

    Ex. 20:1-17; Deut. 5:6-21


93Q. How are these commandments divided?
  A. Into two tables.
		   The first has four commandments,
			 teaching us how we ought to live in relation to God.
		   The second has six commandments,
			 teaching us what we owe our neighbor.1

    Matt. 22:37-39


94 Q. What does the Lord require
		    in the first commandment?
   A. That I, not wanting to endanger my own salvation,
		    avoid and shun
			 all idolatry,1 sorcery, superstitious rites,2
			 and prayer to saints or to other creatures.3

		 That I rightly know the only true God,4
			 trust him alone,5
			 and look to God for every good thing6
				humbly7 and patiently,8
			   and love,9 fear,10 and honor11 God
				 with all my heart.
		 In short,
			 that I give up anything
			 rather than go against God’s will in any way.12

96 Q. What is God’s will for us
		    in the second commandment?
   A. That we in no way make any image of God1

			      than has been commanded in God’s Word.2

97 Q.          May we then not make
		             any image at all?
   A.          God can not and may not
		             be visibly portrayed in any way.

		 Although creatures may be portrayed,
		 yet God forbids making or having such images
			 if one’s intention is to worship them
			 or to serve God through them.1

98 Q. But may not images be permitted in churches
		    in place of books for the unlearned?
   A. No, we should not try to be wiser than God.
		    God wants the Christian community instructed
			 by the living preaching of his Word—1
			 not by idols that cannot even talk.2

99Q. What is the aim of the third commandment?
  A. That we neither blaspheme nor misuse the name of God
			 by cursing,1 perjury,2 or unnecessary oaths,3
		   nor share in such horrible sins
			 by being silent bystanders.4

		 In summary,
			   we should use the holy name of God
				 only with reverence and awe,5
			 so that we may properly
				confess God,6
				 pray to God,7
				and glorify God in all our words and works.8

100 Q. Is blasphemy of God’s name by swearing and cursing
		     really such serious sin
		     that God is angry also with those
		     who do not do all they can
		     to help prevent and forbid it?
    A. Yes, indeed.1
			       No sin is greater
			       or provokes God’s wrath more
			 than blaspheming his name.
		     That is why God commanded it to be punished with death.2

101 Q. But may we swear an oath in God’s name
		     if we do it reverently?
    A. Yes, when the government demands it,
		     or when necessity requires it,
			 in order to maintain and promote truth and trustworthiness
			 for God’s glory and our neighbor’s good.


    106
		 Such oaths are grounded in God’s Word1

				in the Old and New Testaments.2

102 Q. May we also swear by saints or other creatures?
    A. No.
		     A legitimate oath means calling upon God
		     as the only one who knows my heart
			 to witness to my truthfulness
			 and to punish me if I swear falsely.1
		     No creature is worthy of such honor.2

103 Q. What is God’s will for you
		     in the fourth commandment?
    A. First,
			 that the gospel ministry and education for it be maintained,1
			 and that, especially on the festive day of rest,
			I diligently attend the assembly of God’s people2
				 to learn what God’s Word teaches,3
				 to participate in the sacraments,4
				 to pray to God publicly,5
				 and to bring Christian offerings for the poor.6

		Second,
			 that every day of my life
				 I rest from my evil ways,
				 let the Lord work in me through his Spirit,
			 and so begin in this life
			 the eternal Sabbath.7

105 Q. What is God’s will for you
		     in the sixth commandment?
    A. I am not to belittle, hate, insult, or kill my neighbor—
			 not by my thoughts, my words, my look or gesture,
			 and certainly not by actual deeds—
		     and I am not to be party to this in others;1
		     rather, I am to put away all desire for revenge.2

		 I am not to harm or recklessly endanger myself either.3
		 Prevention of murder is also why
			 government is armed with the sword.4

4
  Gen. 9:6; Ex. 21:14; Rom. 13:4


106 Q. Does this commandment refer only to murder?
    A. By forbidding murder God teaches us
			 that he hates the root of murder:
			 envy, hatred, anger, vindictiveness.1

		            In God’s sight all such are disguised forms of murder.2

    108
107 Q. Is it enough then
		     that we do not murder our neighbor
		     in any such way?
    A. No.
		     By condemning envy, hatred, and anger
		God wants us
			 to love our neighbors as ourselves,1
			to be patient, peace-loving, gentle,
				merciful, and friendly toward them,2
		     to protect them from harm as much as we can,
		     and to do good even to our enemies.3

108 Q. What does the seventh commandment teach us?
    A. That God condemns all unchastity,1

			      within or outside of the holy state of marriage.

109 Q. Does God, in this commandment,
		     forbid only such scandalous sins as adultery?
    A. We are temples of the Holy Spirit, body and soul,
		     and God wants both to be kept clean and holy.
		     That is why God forbids
			      all unchaste actions, looks, talk, thoughts, or desires,1
			      and whatever may incite someone to them.2

		            But in God’s sight theft also includes

                                                                                         109

				counterfeit money;

				 or any other means forbidden by God.3

		             In addition God forbids all greed4

			 twist no one’s words,
			 not gossip or slander,
			 nor join in condemning anyone
			      rashly or without a hearing.1

		 Rather, in court and everywhere else,
		 I should avoid lying and deceit of every kind;
			 these are the very devices the devil uses,
			 and they would call down on me God’s intense wrath.2
		 I should love the truth,
			 speak it candidly,
			 and openly acknowledge it.3

			 to guard and advance my neighbor’s good name.4

113 Q. What is the aim of the tenth commandment?
    A. That not even the slightest desire or thought
			 contrary to any one of God’s commandments
			 should ever arise in our hearts.

		 Rather, with all our hearts
			  we should always hate sin
			and take pleasure in whatever is right.1

114 Q.        But can those converted to God
		            obey these commandments perfectly?
    A.        No.
		            In this life even the holiest
		            have only a small beginning of this obedience.1

		            Nevertheless, with all seriousness of purpose,
		            they do begin to live
		            according to all, not only some,
		            of God’s commandments.2

115 Q. Since no one in this life
		     can obey the Ten Commandments perfectly,
		     why does God want them
		     preached so pointedly?
    A. First, so that the longer we live
			 the more we may come to know our sinfulness
			 and the more eagerly look to Christ
				 for forgiveness of sins and righteousness.1




                                                                111
		 Second, so that
		 we may never stop striving,
		 and never stop praying to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit,
			 to be renewed more and more after God’s image,
		 until after this life we reach our goal:
			perfection.2

The Lord’s Prayer

LORD’S DAY 45

116 Q. Why do Christians need to pray?
    A. Because prayer is the most important part
			 of the thankfulness God requires of us.1
		     And also because God gives his grace and Holy Spirit
		     only to those who pray continually and groan inwardly,
			 asking God for these gifts
			 and thanking God for them.2

2
    Matt. 7:7-8; Luke 11:9-13


117 Q. What is the kind of prayer
		     that pleases God and that he listens to?
    A. First, we must pray from the heart
			 to no other than the one true God,
				revealed to us in his Word,
			 asking for everything God has commanded us to ask for.1

		 Second, we must fully recognize our need and misery,
			  so that we humble ourselves in God’s majestic presence.2

		 Third, we must rest on this unshakable foundation:
			 even though we do not deserve it,
			 God will surely listen to our prayer
				 because of Christ our Lord.
			 That is what God promised us in his Word.3

			 and the power
			 and the glory are yours forever.
		Amen.1**

LORD’S DAY 46

120 Q. Why did Christ command us
		     to call God “our Father”?
    A. To awaken in us
		     at the very beginning of our prayer
		     what should be basic to our prayer—
			       a childlike reverence and trust
			       that through Christ God has become our Father,
		     and that just as our parents do not refuse us
			       the things of this life,
		     even less will God our Father refuse to give us
			       what we ask in faith.1

121 Q. Why the words
		     “in heaven”?
    A. These words teach us

			 and to expect everything
				needed for body and soul
				 from God’s almighty power.2

    A. “Hallowed be your name” means:

		 Help us to truly know you,1

			 for all your works
			 and for all that shines forth from them:
				 your almighty power, wisdom, kindness,
				 justice, mercy, and truth.2

		            And it means,

		 Help us to direct all our living—

I. The life of man - to know and love God
1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer
goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.
For this reason, at every time and in every place, God draws close to
man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his
strength. He calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into
the unity of his family, the Church. To accomplish this, when the
fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Saviour.
In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy
Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life.
2 So that this call should resound throughout the world, Christ sent
forth the apostles he had chosen, commissioning them to proclaim the
gospel: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am
with you always, to the close of the age."4 Strengthened by this
mission, the apostles "went forth and preached everywhere, while the
Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that
attended it."5
3 Those who with God's help have welcomed Christ's call and freely
responded to it are urged on by love of Christ to proclaim the Good
News everywhere in the world. This treasure, received from the
apostles, has been faithfully guarded by their successors. All Christ's
faithful are called to hand it on from generation to generation, by
professing the faith, by living it in fraternal sharing, and by celebrating
it in liturgy and prayer.6

II. Handing on the Faith: Catechesis
4 Quite early on, the name catechesis was given to the totality of the
Church's efforts to make disciples, to help men believe that Jesus is the
Son of God so that believing they might have life in his name, and to
educate and instruct them in this life, thus building up the body of
Christ.7
5 "Catechesis is an education in the faith of children, young people and
adults which includes especially the teaching of Christian doctrine
imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and systematic way, with a
view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life."8
6 While not being formally identified with them, catechesis is built on a
certain number of elements of the Church's pastoral mission which
have a catechetical aspect, that prepare for catechesis, or spring from it.
They are: the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary
preaching to arouse faith; examination of the reasons for belief;
experience of Christian living; celebration of the sacraments;
integration into the ecclesial community; and apostolic and missionary
witness.9
7 "Catechesis is intimately bound up with the whole of the Church's
life. Not only her geographical extension and numerical increase, but
even more her inner growth and correspondence with God's plan
depend essentially on catechesis."10
8 Periods of renewal in the Church are also intense moments of
catechesis. In the great era of the Fathers of the Church, saintly
bishops devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis. St.
Cyril of Jerusalem and St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose and St.
Augustine, and many other Fathers wrote catechetical works that
remain models for us.11
9 "The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the
councils. the Council of Trent is a noteworthy example of this. It gave
catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the origin
of the Roman Catechism, which is also known by the name of that
council and which is a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian
teaching. . "12 The Council of Trent initiated a remarkable
organization of the Church's catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy
bishops and theologians such as St. Peter Canisius, St. Charles
Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo or St. Robert Bellarmine, it
occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms.
10 It is therefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again
attracted attention in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which
Pope Paul Vl considered the great catechism of modern times. the
General Catechetical Directory (1971) the sessions of the Synod of
Bishops devoted to evangelization (1974) and catechesis (1977), the
apostolic exhortations Evangelii nuntiandi (1975) and Catechesi
tradendae (1979), attest to this. the Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in
1985 asked "that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine
regarding both faith and morals be composed"13 The Holy Father,
Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish his own, acknowledging that
"this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church
and of the particular Churches."14 He set in motion everything
needed to carry out the Synod Fathers' wish.

III. The Aim and Intended Readership of the Catechism
11 This catechism aims at presenting an organic synthesis of the
essential and fundamental contents of Catholic doctrine, as regards
both faith and morals, in the light of the Second Vatican Council and
the whole of the Church's Tradition. Its principal sources are the
Sacred Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, the liturgy, and the
Church's Magisterium. It is intended to serve "as a point of reference
for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various
countries".15
12 This work is intended primarily for those responsible for catechesis:
first of all the bishops, as teachers of the faith and pastors of the
Church. It is offered to them as an instrument in fulfilling their
responsibility of teaching the People of God. Through the bishops, it is
addressed to redactors of catechisms, to priests, and to catechists. It
will also be useful reading for all other Christian faithful.

PROLOGUE




IV. Structure of this Catechism
13 The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition of
catechisms which build catechesis on four pillars: the baptismal
profession of faith (the Creed), the sacraments of faith, the life of faith
(the Commandments), and the prayer of the believer (the Lord's
Prayer).
Part One: the Profession of Faith
14 Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism must
confess their baptismal faith before men.16 First therefore the
Catechism expounds revelation, by which God addresses and gives
himself to man, and the faith by which man responds to God (Section
One). the profession of faith summarizes the gifts that God gives man:
as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as Sanctifier. It
develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal faith in the one
God: the almighty Father, the Creator; his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord
and Saviour; and the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, in the Holy Church
(Section Two).
Part Two: the Sacraments of Faith
15 The second part of the Catechism explains how God's salvation,
accomplished once for all through Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, is
made present in the sacred actions of the Church's liturgy (Section
One), especially in the seven sacraments (Section Two).
Part Three: the Life of Faith
16 The third part of the Catechism deals with the final end of man
created in the image of God: beatitude, and the ways of reaching it -
through right conduct freely chosen, with the help of God's law and
grace (Section One), and through conduct that fulfils the twofold
commandment of charity, specified in God's Ten Commandments
(Section Two).
Part Four: Prayer in the Life of Faith
17 The last part of the Catechism deals with the meaning and
importance of prayer in the life of believers (Section One). It concludes
with a brief commentary on the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer
(Section Two), for indeed we find in these the sum of all the good
things which we must hope for, and which our heavenly Father wants
to grant us.

PROLOGUE




V. Practical Directions for Using this Catechism
18 This catechism is conceived as an organic presentation of the
Catholic faith in its entirety. It should be seen therefore as a unified
whole. Numerous cross-references in the margin of the text (numbers
found at the end of a sentence referring to other paragraphs that deal
with the same theme), as well as the analytical index at the end of the
volume, allow the reader to view each theme in its relationship with the
entirety of the faith.
19 The texts of Sacred Scripture are often not quoted word for word
but are merely indicated by a reference (cf.). For a deeper
understanding of such passages, the reader should refer to the
Scriptural texts themselves. Such Biblical references are a valuable
working-tool in catechesis.
20 The use of small print in certain passages indicates observations of
an historical or apologetic nature, or supplementary doctrinal
explanations.
21 The quotations, also in small print, from patristic, liturgical,
magisterial or hagiographical sources, are intended to enrich the
doctrinal presentations. These texts have often been chosen with a view
to direct catechetical use.
22 At the end of each thematic unit, a series of brief texts in small
italics sums up the essentials of that unit's teaching in condensed
formulae. These "IN BRIEF" summaries may suggest to local
catechists brief summary formulae that could be memorized.

VI. Necessary Adaptations
23 The Catechism emphasizes the exposition of doctrine. It seeks to
help deepen understanding of faith. In this way it is oriented towards
the maturing of that faith, its putting down roots in personal life, and
its shining forth in personal conduct.17
24 By design, this Catechism does not set out to provide the
adaptation of doctrinal presentations and catechetical methods
required by the differences of culture, age, spiritual maturity, and social
and ecclesial condition among all those to whom it is addressed. Such
indispensable adaptations are the responsibility of particular
catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the faithful:
Whoever teaches must become "all things to all men" (I Cor 9:22), to
win everyone to Christ. . . Above all, teachers must not imagine that a
single kind of soul has been entrusted to them, and that consequently
it is lawful to teach and form equally all the faithful in true piety with
one and the same method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as
newborn babes, others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full
command of their powers.... Those who are called to the ministry of
preaching must suit their words to the maturity and understanding of
their hearers, as they hand on the teaching of the mysteries of faith and
the rules of moral conduct.18
Above all - Charity
25 To conclude this Prologue, it is fitting to recall this pastoral
principle stated by the Roman Catechism:
The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the
love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for
hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made
accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian
virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at
love.19

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH


SECTION ONE "I BELIEVE" - "WE BELIEVE"
26 We begin our profession of faith by saying: "I believe" or "We
believe". Before expounding the Church's faith, as confessed in the
Creed, celebrated in the liturgy and lived in observance of God's
commandments and in prayer, we must first ask what "to believe"
means. Faith is man's response to God, who reveals himself and gives
himself to man, at the same time bringing man a superabundant light
as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. Thus we shall
consider first that search (Chapter One), then the divine Revelation by
which God comes to meet man (Chapter Two), and finally the
response of faith (Chapter Three).

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD


I. The Desire for God
27 The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is
created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to
himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never
stops searching for:
The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to
communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is
addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists it is
because God has created him through love, and through love continues
to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless
he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator.1
28 In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men
have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs
and behaviour: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so
forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they
often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a
religious being:
From one ancestor (God) made all nations to inhabit the whole earth,
and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the
places where they would live, so that they would search for God and
perhaps grope for him and find him - though indeed he is not far from
each one of us. For "in him we live and move and have our being."2
29 But this "intimate and vital bond of man to God" (GS 19 # 1) can
be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man.3 Such
attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world;
religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world;
the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of
thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which
makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.4
30 "Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice."5 Although
man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to
seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God
demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, "an upright
heart", as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God.
You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power
and your wisdom is without measure. and man, so small a part of your
creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality
and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the
proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small a part of your
creation, wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight in
your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless
until it rests in you.6

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD


II. Ways of Coming to Know God
31 Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the
person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him.
These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense
of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging
and convincing arguments", which allow us to attain certainty about
the truth. These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a
twofold point of departure: the physical world, and the human person.
32 The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and
the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as
the origin and the end of the universe.
As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about God is
plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the
creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and
deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made.7


And St. Augustine issues this challenge: Question the beauty of the
earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the beauty of the air
distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of the sky. . .
question all these realities. All respond: "See, we are beautiful." Their
beauty is a profession [confessio]. These beauties are subject to change.
Who made them if not the Beautiful One [Pulcher] who is not subject
to change?8
33 The human person: with his openness to truth and beauty, his sense
of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with
his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself
about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul.
the soul, the "seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the
merely material",9 can have its origin only in God.
34 The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves
neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they
participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. Thus,
in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality
which is the first cause and final end of all things, a reality "that
everyone calls God".10
35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the
existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real
intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to
give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith.(so)
the proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and
help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.

III. The Knowledge of God According to the Church
36 "Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first
principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from
the created world by the natural light of human reason."11 Without
this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God's revelation.
Man has this capacity because he is created "in the image of God".12
37 In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man
experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of
reason alone:
Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own
natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of
the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his
providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator;
yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective
and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the
relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of
things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it,
they call for self-surrender and abnegation. the human mind, in its
turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the
impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered
appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that
men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would
not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.13
38 This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God's
revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding,
but also "about those religious and moral truths which of themselves
are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present
condition of the human race, they can be known by all men with ease,
with firm certainty and with no admixture of error".14

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD




IV. How Can We Speak about God?
39 In defending the ability of human reason to know God, the Church
is expressing her confidence in the possibility of speaking about him to
all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue with other
religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with unbelievers and
atheists.
40 Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is
equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting
point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of knowing and
thinking.
41 All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most especially
man, created in the image and likeness of God. the manifold
perfections of creatures - their truth, their goodness, their beauty all
reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we can name God
by taking his creatures" perfections as our starting point, "for from the
greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding
perception of their Creator".15
42 God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continually purify
our language of everything in it that is limited, imagebound or
imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God --"the
inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable"--
with our human representations.16 Our human words always fall short
of the mystery of God.
43 Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using
human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does attain to God
himself, though unable to express him in his infinite simplicity.
Likewise, we must recall that "between Creator and creature no
similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater
dissimilitude";17 and that "concerning God, we cannot grasp what he
is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to
him."18

CHAPTER ONE MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD




IN BRIEF
44 Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God,
going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by
his bond with God.
45 Man is made to live in communion with God in whom he finds
happiness: When I am completely united to you, there will be no more
sorrow or trials; entirely full of you, my life will be complete (St.
Augustine, Conf. 10, 28, 39: PL 32, 795}.
46 When he listens to the message of creation and to the voice of
conscience, man can arrive at certainty about the existence of God, the
cause and the end of everything.
47 The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator and Lord,
can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of
human reason (cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2 # 1: DS 3026),
48 We really can name God, starting from the manifold perfections of
his creatures, which are likenesses of the infinitely perfect God, even if
our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery.
49 Without the Creator, the creature vanishes (GS 36). This is the
reason why believers know that the love of Christ urges them to bring
the light of the living God to those who do not know him or who reject
him.

CHAPTER TWO GOD COMES TO MEET MAN
50 By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of
his works. But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot
possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation.1
Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given
himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of
loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of
all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

Article 1 THE REVELATION OF GOD
I. God Reveals His "Plan of Loving Goodness"
51 "It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and
to make known the mystery of his will. His will was that men should
have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the
Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature."2
52 God, who "dwells in unapproachable light", wants to communicate
his own divine life to the men he freely created, in order to adopt them
as his sons in his only-begotten Son.3 By revealing himself God wishes
to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him and
of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity.
53 The divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously "by deeds
and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other"4 and
shed light on each another. It involves a specific divine pedagogy: God
communicates himself to man gradually. He prepares him to welcome
by stages the supernatural Revelation that is to culminate in the person
and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ.
St. Irenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine pedagogy using
the image of God and man becoming accustomed to one another: the
Word of God dwelt in man and became the Son of man in order to
accustom man to perceive God and to accustom God to dwell in man,
according to the Father's pleasure.5

II. The Stages of Revelation
In the beginning God makes himself known
54 "God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word, provides
men with constant evidence of himself in created realities. and
furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation - he
manifested himself to our first parents from the very beginning."6 He
invited them to intimate communion with himself and clothed them
with resplendent grace and justice.
55 This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin. "After
the fall, (God) buoyed them up with the hope of salvation, by
promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his solicitude
for the human race. For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who
seek salvation by patience in well-doing."7
Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship you did not
abandon him to the power of death. . . Again and again you offered a
covenant to man.8
The covenant with Noah
56 After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once
sought to save humanity part by part. the covenant with Noah after the
flood gives expression to the principle of the divine economy toward
the "nations", in other words, towards men grouped "in their lands,
each with (its) own language, by their families, in their nations".9
57 This state of division into many nations is at once cosmic, social and
religious. It is intended to limit the pride of fallen humanity10 united
only in its perverse ambition to forge its own unity as at Babel.11 But,
because of sin, both polytheism and the idolatry of the nation and of its
rulers constantly threaten this provisional economy with the perversion
of paganism.12
58 The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the
Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel.13 The Bible
venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel the just, the
king-priest Melchisedek - a figure of Christ - and the upright "Noah,
Daniel, and Job".14 Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity
that can be reached by those who live according to the covenant of
Noah, waiting for Christ to "gather into one the children of God who
are scattered abroad".15
God chooses Abraham
59 In order to gather together scattered humanity God calls Abram
from his country, his kindred and his father's house,16 and makes him
Abraham, that is, "the father of a multitude of nations". "In you all the
nations of the earth shall be blessed."17
60 The people descended from Abraham would be the trustee of the
promise made to the patriarchs, the chosen people, called to prepare
for that day when God would gather all his children into the unity of
the Church.18 They would be the root on to which the Gentiles would
be grafted, once they came to believe.19
61 The patriarchs, prophets and certain other Old Testament figures
have been and always will be honoured as saints in all the Church's
liturgical traditions.
God forms his people Israel
62 After the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by freeing
them from slavery in Egypt. He established with them the covenant of
Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law so that they would
recognize him and serve him as the one living and true God, the
provident Father and just judge, and so that they would look for the
promised Saviour.20
63 Israel is the priestly people of God, "called by the name of the
LORD", and "the first to hear the word of God",21 The people of
"elder brethren" in the faith of Abraham.
64 Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope of
salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant
intended for all, to be written on their hearts.22 The prophets proclaim
a radical redemption of the People of God, purification from all their
infidelities, a salvation which will include all the nations.23 Above all,
the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this hope. Such holy women
as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Judith and
Esther kept alive the hope of Israel's salvation. the purest figure among
them is Mary.24

III. Christ Jesus -- "Mediator and Fullness of All Revelation"25
God has said everything in his Word
65 "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the
prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son."26
Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father's one, perfect and
unsurpassable Word. In him he has said everything; there will be no
other word than this one. St. John of the Cross, among others,
commented strikingly on Hebrews 1:1-2:
In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other), he
spoke everything to us at once in this sole Word - and he has no more
to say. . . because what he spoke before to the prophets in parts, he has
now spoken all at once by giving us the All Who is His Son. Any person
questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty
not only of foolish behaviour but also of offending him, by not fixing
his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some
other novelty.27
There will be no further Revelation
66 "The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive
Covenant, will never pass away; and no new public revelation is to be
expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus
Christ."28 Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been
made completely explicit; it remains for Christian faith gradually to
grasp its full significance over the course of the centuries.
67 Throughout the ages, there have been so-called "private"
revelations, some of which have been recognized by the authority of
the Church. They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It is
not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation, but
to help live more fully by it in a certain period of history. Guided by
the Magisterium of the Church, the sensus fidelium knows how to
discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an
authentic call of Christ or his saints to the Church.
Christian faith cannot accept "revelations" that claim to surpass or
correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment, as is the case in
certain non Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which
base themselves on such "revelations".

IN BRIEF
68 By love, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. He has
thus provided the definitive, superabundant answer to the questions
that man asks himself about the meaning and purpose of his life.
69 God has revealed himself to man by gradually communicating his
own mystery in deeds and in words.
70 Beyond the witness to himself that God gives in created things, he
manifested himself to our first parents, spoke to them and, after the
fall, promised them salvation (cf Gen 3:15) and offered them his
covenant.
71 God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and with all living
beings (cf Gen 9:16). It will remain in force as long as the world lasts.
72 God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him and his
descendants. By the covenant God formed his people and revealed his
law to them through Moses. Through the prophets, he prepared them
to accept the salvation destined for all humanity.
73 God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he
has established his covenant for ever. the Son is his Father's definitive
Word; so there will be no further Revelation after him.

I. The Apostolic Tradition
75 "Christ the Lord, in whom the entire Revelation of the most high
God is summed up, commanded the apostles to preach the Gospel,
which had been promised beforehand by the prophets, and which he
fulfilled in his own person and promulgated with his own lips. In
preaching the Gospel, they were to communicate the gifts of God to all
men. This Gospel was to be the source of all saving truth and moral
discipline."32
In the apostolic preaching. . .
76 In keeping with the Lord's command, the Gospel was handed on in
two ways:
- orally "by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of their
preaching, by the example they gave, by the institutions they
established, what they themselves had received - whether from the lips
of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they had
learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit";33
- in writing "by those apostles and other men associated with the
apostles who, under the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit, committed
the message of salvation to writing".34
. . . continued in apostolic succession
77 "In order that the full and living Gospel might always be preserved
in the Church the apostles left bishops as their successors. They gave
them their own position of teaching authority."35 Indeed, "the
apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired
books, was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the
end of time."36
78 This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called
Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though closely
connected to it. Through Tradition, "the Church, in her doctrine, life
and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she
herself is, all that she believes."37 "The sayings of the holy Fathers are
a witness to the life-giving presence of this Tradition, showing how its
riches are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her
belief and her prayer."38
79 The Father's self-communication made through his Word in the
Holy Spirit, remains present and active in the Church: "God, who
spoke in the past, continues to converse with the Spouse of his beloved
Son. and the Holy Spirit, through whom the living voice of the Gospel
rings out in the Church - and through her in the world - leads believers
to the full truth, and makes the Word of Christ dwell in them in all its
richness."39

II. The Relationship Between Tradition and Sacred Scripture
One common source. . .
80 "Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely
together, and communicate one with the other. For both of them,
flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some
fashion to form one thing, and move towards the same goal."40 Each
of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the mystery of
Christ, who promised to remain with his own "always, to the close of
the age".41
. . . two distinct modes of transmission
81 "Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing
under the breath of the Holy Spirit."42
"and [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God which
has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy
Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the apostles so that,
enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully preserve,
expound and spread it abroad by their preaching."43
82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and
interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, "does not derive her certainty
about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both
Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal
sentiments of devotion and reverence."44
Apostolic Tradition and ecclesial traditions
83 The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands
on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they
learned from the Holy Spirit. the first generation of Christians did not
yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself
demonstrates the process of living Tradition.
Tradition is to be distinguished from the various theological,
disciplinary, liturgical or devotional traditions, born in the local
churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different
places and times, in which the great Tradition is expressed. In the light
of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even
abandoned under the guidance of the Church's Magisterium.

III. The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith
The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church
84 The apostles entrusted the "Sacred deposit" of the faith (the
depositum fidei),45 contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, to
the whole of the Church. "By adhering to [this heritage] the entire holy
people, united to its pastors, remains always faithful to the teaching of
the apostles, to the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and the
prayers. So, in maintaining, practising and professing the faith that has
been handed on, there should be a remarkable harmony between the
bishops and the faithful."46
The Magisterium of the Church
85 "The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God,
whether in its written form or in the form of Tradition, has been
entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone. Its
authority in this matter is exercised in the name of Jesus Christ."47
This means that the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the
bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the Bishop of
Rome.
86 "Yet this Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God, but is its
servant. It teaches only what has been handed on to it. At the divine
command and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it listens to this
devotedly, guards it with dedication and expounds it faithfully. All that
it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed is drawn from this
single deposit of faith."48
87 Mindful of Christ's words to his apostles: "He who hears you, hears
me",49 The faithful receive with docility the teachings and directives
that their pastors give them in different forms.
The dogmas of the faith
88 The Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds from
Christ to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is, when it
proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an irrevocable
adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revelation or also when
it proposes, in a definitive way, truths having a necessary connection
with these.
89 There is an organic connection between our spiritual life and the
dogmas. Dogmas are lights along the path of faith; they illuminate it
and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright, our intellect and
heart will be open to welcome the light shed by the dogmas of faith.50
90 The mutual connections between dogmas, and their coherence, can
be found in the whole of the Revelation of the mystery of Christ.51 "In
Catholic doctrine there exists an order or hierarchy 234 of truths, since
they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith."52
The supernatural sense of faith
91 All the faithful share in understanding and handing on revealed
truth. They have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, who
instructs them53 and guides them into all truth.54
92 "The whole body of the faithful. . . cannot err in matters of belief.
This characteristic is shown in the supernatural appreciation of faith
(sensus fidei) on the part of the whole people, when, from the bishops
to the last of the faithful, they manifest a universal consent in matters
of faith and morals."55
93 "By this appreciation of the faith, aroused and sustained by the
Spirit of truth, the People of God, guided by the sacred teaching
authority (Magisterium),. . . receives. . . the faith, once for all delivered
to the saints. . . the People unfailingly adheres to this faith, penetrates
it more deeply with right judgment, and applies it more fully in daily
life."56
Growth in understanding the faith
94 Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of
both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow
in the life of the Church:
- "through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these
things in their hearts";57 it is in particular "theological research
[which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth".58
- "from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which [believers]
experience",59 The sacred Scriptures "grow with the one who reads
them."60
- "from the preaching of those who have received, along with their right
of succession in the episcopate, the sure charism of truth".61
95 "It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrangement of
God, sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture and the Magisterium of the
Church are so connected and associated that one of them cannot stand
without the others. Working together, each in its own way, under the
action of the one Holy Spirit, they all contribute effectively to the
salvation of souls."62

IN BRIEF
96 What Christ entrusted to the apostles, they in turn handed on by
their preaching and writing, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to
all generations, until Christ returns in glory.
97 "Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred
deposit of the Word of God" (DV 10) in which, as in a mirror, the
pilgrim Church contemplates God, the source of all her riches.
98 "The Church, in her doctrine, life and worship, perpetuates and
transmits to every generation all that she herself is, all that she
believes" (DV 8 # 1).
99 Thanks to its supernatural sense of faith, the People of God as a
whole never ceases to welcome, to penetrate more deeply and to live
more fully from the gift of divine Revelation.
100 The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been
entrusted solely to the Magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope
and to the bishops in communion with him.

Article 3 SACRED SCRIPTURE
I. Christ - The Unique Word of Sacred Scripture
101 In order to reveal himself to men, in the condescension of his
goodness God speaks to them in human words: "Indeed the words of
God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like human
language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he took on
himself the flesh of human weakness, became like men."63
102 Through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks only one
single Word, his one Utterance in whom he expresses himself
completely:64
You recall that one and the same Word of God extends throughout
Scripture, that it is one and the same Utterance that resounds in the
mouths of all the sacred writers, since he who was in the beginning
God with God has no need of separate syllables; for he is not subject to
time.65
103 For this reason, the Church has always venerated the Scriptures as
she venerates the Lord's Body. She never ceases to present to the
faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of God's Word and
Christ's Body.66
104 In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nourishment
and her strength, for she welcomes it not as a human word, "but as
what it really is, the word of God".67 "In the sacred books, the Father
who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children, and talks with
them."68

II. Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture
105 God is the author of Sacred Scripture. "The divinely revealed
realities, which are contained and presented in the text of Sacred
Scripture, have been written down under the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit."69
"For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the apostolic age,
accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old and the New
Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on the grounds that,
written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their
author, and have been handed on as such to the Church herself."70
106 God inspired the human authors of the sacred books. "To
compose the sacred books, God chose certain men who, all the while
he employed them in this task, made full use of their own faculties and
powers so that, though he acted in them and by them, it was as true
authors that they consigned to writing whatever he wanted written, and
no more."71
107 The inspired books teach the truth. "Since therefore all that the
inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as
affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of
Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which
God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred
Scriptures."72
108 Still, the Christian faith is not a "religion of the book". Christianity
is the religion of the "Word" of God, " a word which is not a written
and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living".73 If the
Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ, the eternal Word of
the living God, must, through the Holy Spirit, "open (our) minds to
understand the Scriptures."74

III. The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture
109 In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way. To
interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to what the
human authors truly wanted to affirm, and to what God wanted to
reveal to us by their words.75
110 In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the reader must
take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the literary
genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, speaking and
narrating then current. "For the fact is that truth is differently
presented and expressed in the various types of historical writing, in
prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of literary
expression."76
111 But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and no less
important principle of correct interpretation, without which Scripture
would remain a dead letter. "Sacred Scripture must be read and
interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was written."77
The Second Vatican Council indicates three criteria for interpreting
Scripture in accordance with the Spirit who inspired it.78
112 Be especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole
Scripture". Different as the books which compose it may be, Scripture
is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus is
the center and heart, open since his Passover.79
The phrase "heart of Christ" can refer to Sacred Scripture, which
makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as the Scripture was
obscure. But the Scripture has been opened since the Passion; since
those who from then on have understood it, consider and discern in
what way the prophecies must be interpreted.80
113 2. Read the Scripture within "the living Tradition of the whole
Church". According to a saying of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is
written principally in the Church's heart rather than in documents and
records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living memorial of
God's Word, and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her the spiritual
interpretation of the Scripture (". . . according to the spiritual meaning
which the Spirit grants to the Church"81).
114 3. Be attentive to the analogy of faith.82 By "analogy of faith" we
mean the coherence of the truths of faith among themselves and within
the whole plan of Revelation.
The senses of Scripture
115 According to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between
two senses of Scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being
subdivided into the allegorical, moral and anagogical senses. the
profound concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to
the living reading of Scripture in the Church.
116 The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of
Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound
interpretation: "All other senses of Sacred Scripture are based on the
literal."83
117 The spiritual sense. Thanks to the unity of God's plan, not only the
text of Scripture but also the realities and events about which it speaks
can be signs.
1. the allegorical sense. We can acquire a more profound understanding
of events by recognizing their significance in Christ; thus the crossing
of the Red Sea is a sign or type of Christ's victory and also of Christian
Baptism.84
2. the moral sense. the events reported in Scripture ought to lead us to
act justly. As St. Paul says, they were written "for our instruction".85
3. the anagogical sense (Greek: anagoge, "leading"). We can view
realities and events in terms of their eternal significance, leading us
toward our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is a sign of the
heavenly Jerusalem.86
118 A medieval couplet summarizes the significance of the four senses:
The Letter speaks of deeds; Allegory to faith;
The Moral how to act; Anagogy our destiny.87
119 "It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules,
towards a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of
Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church to
form a firmer judgement. For, of course, all that has been said about
the manner of interpreting Scripture is ultimately subject to the
judgement of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred
commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word
of God."88
But I would not believe in the Gospel, had not the authority of the
Catholic Church already moved me.89

IV. The Canon of Scripture
120 It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned which
writings are to be included in the list of the sacred books.90
This complete list is called the canon of Scripture. It includes 46 books
for the Old Testament (45 if we count Jeremiah and Lamentations as
one) and 27 for the New.91
The Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1
and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther, 1 and 2
Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, the
Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,
Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah and
Malachi.


The New Testament: the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the Letters of St. Paul to the
Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,
Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon,
the Letter to the Hebrews, the Letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2 and
3 John, and Jude, and Revelation (the Apocalypse).
The Old Testament
121 The Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacred Scripture.
Its books are divinely inspired and retain a permanent value,92 for the
Old Covenant has never been revoked.
122 Indeed, "the economy of the Old Testament was deliberately SO
oriented that it should prepare for and declare in prophecy the coming
of Christ, redeemer of all men."93 "Even though they contain matters
imperfect and provisional,94 The books of the OldTestament bear
witness to the whole divine pedagogy of God's saving love: these
writings "are a storehouse of sublime teaching on God and of sound
wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful treasury of prayers; in
them, too, the mystery of our salvation is present in a hidden way."95
123 Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of God. the
Church has always vigorously opposed the idea of rejecting the Old
Testament under the pretext that the New has rendered it void
(Marcionism).
The New Testament
124 "The Word of God, which is the power of God for salvation to
everyone who has faith, is set forth and displays its power in a most
wonderful way in the writings of the New Testament"96 which hand on
the ultimate truth of God's Revelation. Their central object is Jesus
Christ, God's incarnate Son: his acts, teachings, Passion and
glorification, and his Church's beginnings under the Spirit's
guidance.97
125 The Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures "because they are
our principal source for the life and teaching of the Incarnate Word,
our Saviour".98
126 We can distinguish three stages in the formation of the Gospels:
1. the life and teaching of Jesus. the Church holds firmly that the four
Gospels, "whose historicity she unhesitatingly affirms, faithfully hand
on what Jesus, the Son of God, while he lived among men, really did
and taught for their eternal salvation, until the day when he was taken
up."99
2. the oral tradition. "For, after the ascension of the Lord, the apostles
handed on to their hearers what he had said and done, but with that
fuller understanding which they, instructed by the glorious events of
Christ and enlightened by the Spirit of truth, now enjoyed."100
3. the written Gospels. "The sacred authors, in writing the four
Gospels, selected certain of the many elements which had been handed
on, either orally or already in written form; others they synthesized or
explained with an eye to the situation of the churches, the while
sustaining the form of preaching, but always in such a fashion that they
have told us the honest truth about Jesus."101
127 The fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as is
evident both in the veneration which the liturgy accords it and in the
surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all times:
There is no doctrine which could be better, more precious and more
splendid than the text of the Gospel. Behold and retain what our Lord
and Master, Christ, has taught by his words and accomplished by his
deeds.102
But above all it's the gospels that occupy my mind when I'm at prayer;
my poor soul has so many needs, and yet this is the one thing needful.
I'm always finding fresh lights there; hidden meanings which had
meant nothing to me hitherto.103
The unity of the Old and New Testaments
128 The Church, as early as apostolic times,104 and then constantly in
her Tradition, has illuminated the unity of the divine plan in the two
Testaments through typology, which discerns in God's works of the
Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished in the fullness of
time in the person of his incarnate Son.
129 Christians therefore read the Old Testament in the light of Christ
crucified and risen. Such typological reading discloses the
inexhaustible content of the Old Testament; but it must not make us
forget that the Old Testament retains its own intrinsic value as
Revelation reaffirmed by our Lord himself.105 Besides, the New
Testament has to be read in the light of the Old. Early Christian
catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament.106 As an old
saying put it, the New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old
Testament is unveiled in the New.107
130 Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the fulfilment
of the divine plan when "God [will] be everything to everyone."108
Nor do the calling of the patriarchs and the exodus from Egypt, for
example, lose their own value in God's plan, from the mere fact that
they were intermediate stages.

V. Sacred Scripture in the Life of the Church
131 "and such is the force and power of the Word of God that it can
serve the Church as her support and vigour, and the children of the
Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a pure and
lasting fount of spiritual life."109 Hence "access to Sacred Scripture
ought to be open wide to the Christian faithful."110
132 "Therefore, the study of the sacred page should be the very soul of
sacred theology. the ministry of the Word, too - pastoral preaching,
catechetics and all forms of Christian instruction, among which the
liturgical homily should hold pride of place - is healthily nourished and
thrives in holiness through the Word of Scripture."111
133 The Church "forcefully and specifically exhorts all the Christian
faithful... to learn the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ, by
frequent reading of the divine Scriptures. Ignorance of the Scriptures is
ignorance of Christ.112

IN BRIEF
134 "All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and that one book is Christ,
because all divine Scripture speaks of Christ, and all divine Scripture is
fulfilled in Christ" (Hugh of St. Victor, De arca Noe 2, 8: PL 176, 642;
cf. ibid, 2, 9: PL. 176, 642-643).
135 "The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and, because
they are inspired, they are truly the Word of God" (DV 24).
136 God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its
human authors; he acts in them and by means of them. He thus gives
assurance that their writings teach without error his saving truth (cf
DV 11).
137 Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be attentive above all
to what God wants to reveal through the sacred authors for our
salvation. What comes from the Spirit is not fully "understood except
by the Spirit's action' (cf. Origen, Hom. in Ex. 4, 5: PG 12, 320).
138 The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the 46 books of the
Old Testament and the 27 books of the New.
139 The four Gospels occupy a central place because Christ Jesus is
their centre.
140 The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the unity of God's
plan and his Revelation. the Old Testament prepares for the New and
the New Testament fulfils the Old; the two shed light on each other;
both are true Word of God.
141 "The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she
venerated the Body of the Lord" (DV 21): both nourish and govern the
whole Christian life. "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my
path" (Ps 119:105; cf. Is 50:4).

CHAPTER THREE MAN'S RESPONSE TO GOD
142 By his Revelation, "the invisible God, from the fullness of his love,
addresses men as his friends, and moves among them, in order to invite
and receive them into his own company."1 The adequate response to
this invitation is faith.
143 By faith, man completely submits his intellect and his will to
God.2 With his whole being man gives his assent to God the revealer.
Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the author of
revelation, "the obedience of faith".3

Article 1 I BELIEVE
I. The Obedience of Faith
144 To obey (from the Latin ob-audire, to "hear or listen to") in faith is
to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because its truth is
guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself. Abraham is the model of such
obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture. the Virgin Mary is its most
perfect embodiment.
Abraham - "father of all who believe"
145 The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of
Israel's ancestors, lays special emphasis on Abraham's faith: "By faith,
Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was
to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he
was to go."4 By faith, he lived as a stranger and pilgrim in the
promised land.5 By faith, Sarah was given to conceive the son of the
promise. and by faith Abraham offered his only son in sacrifice.6
146 Abraham thus fulfils the definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1:
"Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not
seen":7 "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as
righteousness."8 Because he was "strong in his faith", Abraham became
the "father of all who believe".9
147 The Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith. the Letter to
the Hebrews proclaims its eulogy of the exemplary faith of the
ancestors who "received divine approval".10 Yet "God had foreseen
something better for us": the grace of believing in his Son Jesus, "the
pioneer and perfecter of our faith".11
Mary - "Blessed is she who believed"
148 The Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience of faith.
By faith Mary welcomes the tidings and promise brought by the angel
Gabriel, believing that "with God nothing will be impossible" and so
giving her assent: "Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be
[done] to me according to your word."12 Elizabeth greeted her:
"Blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what
was spoken to her from the Lord."13 It is for this faith that all
generations have called Mary blessed.14


149 Throughout her life and until her last ordeal15 when Jesus her son
died on the cross, Mary's faith never wavered. She never ceased to
believe in the fulfilment of God's word. and so the Church venerates in
Mary the purest realization of faith.

II. "I Know Whom I Have Believed"16
To believe in God alone
150 Faith is first of all a personal adherence of man to God. At the
same time, and inseparably, it is a free assent to the whole truth that
God has revealed. As personal adherence to God and assent to his
truth, Christian faith differs from our faith in any human person. It is
right and just to entrust oneself wholly to God and to believe
absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place such faith
in a creature.17
To believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God
151 For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from
believing in the One he sent, his "beloved Son", in whom the Father is
"well pleased"; God tells us to listen to him.18 The Lord himself said
to his disciples: "Believe in God, believe also in me."19 We can believe
in Jesus Christ because he is himself God, the Word made flesh: "No
one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father, he has made him known."20 Because he "has seen the Father",
Jesus Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him.21
To believe in the Holy Spirit
152 One cannot believe in Jesus Christ without sharing in his Spirit. It
is the Holy Spirit who reveals to men who Jesus is. For "no one can say
"Jesus is Lord", except by the Holy Spirit",22 who "searches
everything, even the depths of God. . No one comprehends the
thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God."23 Only God knows God
completely: we believe in the Holy Spirit because he is God.
The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in one only God:
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

III. The Characteristics of Faith
Faith is a grace
153 When St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the
living God, Jesus declared to him that this revelation did not come
"from flesh and blood", but from "my Father who is in heaven".24
Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him. "Before
this faith can be exercised, man must have the grace of God to move
and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the Holy Spirit, who
moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the eyes of the
mind and 'makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth.'"25
Faith is a human act
154 Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps of the
Holy Spirit. But it is no less true that believing is an authentically
human act. Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has revealed
is contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason. Even in
human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other
persons tell us about themselves and their intentions, or to trust their
promises (for example, when a man and a woman marry) to share a
communion of life with one another. If this is so, still less is it contrary
to our dignity to "yield by faith the full submission of... intellect and
will to God who reveals",26 and to share in an interior communion
with him.
155 In faith, the human intellect and will co-operate with divine grace:
"Believing is an act of the intellect assenting to the divine truth by
command of the will moved by God through grace."27
Faith and understanding
156 What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed truths appear
as true and intelligible in the light of our natural reason: we believe
"because of the authority of God himself who reveals them, who can
neither deceive nor be deceived".28 So "that the submission of our
faith might nevertheless be in accordance with reason, God willed that
external proofs of his Revelation should be joined to the internal helps
of the Holy Spirit."29 Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints,
prophecies, the Church's growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and
stability "are the most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the
intelligence of all"; they are "motives of credibility" (motiva
credibilitatis), which show that the assent of faith is "by no means a
blind impulse of the mind".30
157 Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowledge
because it is founded on the very word of God who cannot lie. To be
sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason and
experience, but "the certainty that the divine light gives is greater than
that which the light of natural reason gives."31 "Ten thousand
difficulties do not make one doubt."32
158 "Faith seeks understanding":33 it is intrinsic to faith that a believer
desires to know better the One in whom he has put his faith, and to
understand better what He has revealed; a more penetrating knowledge
will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love. the
grace of faith opens "the eyes of your hearts"34 to a lively
understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of the totality of
God's plan and the mysteries of faith, of their connection with each
other and with Christ, the centre of the revealed mystery. "The same
Holy Spirit constantly perfects faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may
be more and more profoundly understood."35 In the words of St.
Augustine, "I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the
better to believe."36
159 Faith and science: "Though faith is above reason, there can never
be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God
who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason
on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever
contradict truth."37 "Consequently, methodical research in all
branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific
manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the
faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive
from the same God. the humble and persevering investigator of the
secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of
himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what
they are."38
The freedom of faith
160 To be human, "man's response to God by faith must be free, and...
therefore nobody is to be forced to embrace the faith against his will.
the act of faith is of its very nature a free act."39 "God calls men to
serve him in spirit and in truth. Consequently they are bound to him
in conscience, but not coerced. . . This fact received its fullest
manifestation in Christ Jesus."40 Indeed, Christ invited people to faith
and conversion, but never coerced them. "For he bore witness to the
truth but refused to use force to impose it on those who spoke against
it. His kingdom... grows by the love with which Christ, lifted up on the
cross, draws men to himself."41
The necessity of faith
161 Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our
salvation is necessary for obtaining that salvation.42 "Since "without
faith it is impossible to please (God) " and to attain to the fellowship of
his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification,
nor will anyone obtain eternal life 'But he who endures to the end.'"]
Perseverance in faith
162 Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can lose
this priceless gift, as St. Paul indicated to St. Timothy: "Wage the good
warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience,
certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith."44 To live, grow
and persevere in the faith until the end we must nourish it with the
word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase our faith;45 it must be
"working through charity," abounding in hope, and rooted in the faith
of the Church.46
Faith - the beginning of eternal life
163 Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific vision, the
goal of our journey here below. Then we shall see God "face to face",
"as he is".47 So faith is already the beginning of eternal life:
When we contemplate the blessings of faith even now, as if gazing at a
reflection in a mirror, it is as if we already possessed the wonderful
things which our faith assures us we shall one day enjoy.48
164 Now, however, "we walk by faith, not by sight";49 we perceive
God as "in a mirror, dimly" and only "in part".50 Even though
enlightened by him in whom it believes, faith is often lived in darkness
and can be put to the test. the world we live in often seems very far
from the one promised us by faith. Our experiences of evil and
suffering, injustice and death, seem to contradict the Good News; they
can shake our faith and become a temptation against it.
165 It is then we must turn to the witnesses of faith: to Abraham, who
"in hope... believed against hope";51 to the Virgin Mary, who, in "her
pilgrimage of faith", walked into the "night of faith"52 in sharing the
darkness of her son's suffering and death; and to so many others:
"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and
let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to
Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith."53

Article 2 WE BELIEVE
166 Faith is a personal act - the free response of the human person to
the initiative of God who reveals himself. But faith is not an isolated
act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live alone.
You have not given yourself faith as you have not given yourself life. the
believer has received faith from others and should hand it on to others.
Our love for Jesus and for our neighbour impels us to speak to others
about our faith. Each believer is thus a link in the great chain of
believers. I cannot believe without being carried by the faith of others,
and by my faith I help support others in the faith.
167 "I believe" (Apostles' Creed) is the faith of the Church professed
personally by each believer, principally during Baptism. "We believe"
(Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) is the faith of the Church
confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more generally by the
liturgical assembly of believers. "I believe" is also the Church, our
mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches us to say both "I
believe" and "We believe".

Article 2 WE BELIEVE
I. "Lord, Look Upon the Faith of Your Church"
168 It is the Church that believes first, and so bears, nourishes and
sustains my faith. Everywhere, it is the Church that first confesses the
Lord: "Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you", as we
sing in the hymn Te Deum; with her and in her, we are won over and
brought to confess: "I believe", "We believe". It is through the Church
that we receive faith and new life in Christ by Baptism. In the Rituale
Romanum, the minister of Baptism asks the catechumen: "What do
you ask of God's Church?" and the answer is: "Faith." "What does faith
offer you?" "Eternal life."54
169 Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive the life of
faith through the Church, she is our mother: "We believe the Church
as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church as if she were
the author of our salvation."55 Because she is our mother, she is also
our teacher in the faith.

II. The Language of Faith
170 We do not believe in formulae, but in those realities they express,
which faith allows us to touch. "The believer's act [of faith] does not
terminate in the propositions, but in the realities [which they
express]."56 All the same, we do approach these realities with the help
of formulations of the faith which permit us to express the faith and to
hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to assimilate and live on it
more and more.
171 The Church, "the pillar and bulwark of the truth", faithfully guards
"the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints". She guards
the memory of Christ's words; it is she who from generation to
generation hands on the apostles' confession of faith.57 As a mother
who teaches her children to speak and so to understand and
communicate, the Church our Mother teaches us the language of faith
in order to introduce us to the understanding and the life of faith.

III. Only One Faith
172 Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures, peoples
and nations, the Church has constantly confessed this one faith,
received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and
grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and
Father.58 St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a witness of this faith, declared:
173 "Indeed, the Church, though scattered throughout the whole
world, even to the ends of the earth, having received the faith from the
apostles and their disciples. . . guards [this preaching and faith] with
care, as dwelling in but a single house, and similarly believes as if
having but one soul and a single heart, and preaches, teaches and
hands on this faith with a unanimous voice, as if possessing only one
mouth."59
174 "For though languages differ throughout the world, the content of
the Tradition is one and the same. the Churches established in
Germany have no other faith or Tradition, nor do those of the Iberians,
nor those of the Celts, nor those of the East, of Egypt, of Libya, nor
those established at the centre of the world. . ."60 The Church's
message "is true and solid, in which one and the same way of salvation
appears throughout the whole world."61
175 "We guard with care the faith that we have received from the
Church, for without ceasing, under the action of God's Spirit, this
deposit of great price, as if in an excellent vessel, is constantly being
renewed and causes the very vessel that contains it to be renewed."62

IN BRIEF
176 Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God who
reveals himself. It involves an assent of the intellect and will to the self-
revelation God has made through his deeds and words.
177 "To believe" has thus a twofold reference: to the person, and to the
truth: to the truth, by trust in the person who bears witness to it.
178 We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit.
179 Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to believe, man
needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.
180 "Believing" is a human act, conscious and free, corresponding to
the dignity of the human person.
181 "Believing" is an ecclesial act. the Church's faith precedes,
engenders, supports and nourishes our faith. the Church is the mother
of all believers. "No one can have God as Father who does not have the
Church as Mother" (St. Cyprian, De unit. 6: PL 4, 519).
182 We believe all "that which is contained in the word of God, written
or handed down, and which the Church proposes for belief as divinely
revealed" (Paul VI, CPG # 20).
183 Faith is necessary for salvation. the Lord himself affirms: "He who
believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will
be condemned" (Mk 16:16).
184 "Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us blessed in
the life to come" (St. Thomas Aquinas. Comp. theol. 1, 2).

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS
185 Whoever says "I believe" says "I pledge myself to what we believe."
Communion in faith needs a common language of faith, normative for
all and uniting all in the same confession of faith.
186 From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and handed
on her faith in brief formulae normative for all.1 But already very early
on, the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of her faith
into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for
candidates for Baptism:
This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human opinions,
but rather what was of the greatest importance was gathered from all
the Scriptures, to present the one teaching of the faith in its entirety.
and just as the mustard seed contains a great number of branches in a
tiny grain, so too this summary of faith encompassed in a few words
the whole knowledge of the true religion contained in the Old and the
New Testaments.2
187 Such syntheses are called "professions of faith" since they
summarize the faith that Christians profess. They are called "creeds"
on account of what is usually their first word in Latin: credo ("I
believe"). They are also called "symbols of faith".
188 The Greek word symbolon meant half of a broken object, for
example, a seal presented as a token of recognition. the broken parts
were placed together to verify the bearer's identity. the symbol of faith,
then, is a sign of recognition and communion between believers.
Symbolon also means a gathering, collection or summary. A symbol of
faith is a summary of the principal truths of the faith and therefore
serves as the first and fundamental point of reference for catechesis.
189 The first "profession of faith" is made during Baptism. the symbol
of faith is first and foremost the baptismal creed. Since Baptism is
given "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit",3 The truths of faith professed during Baptism are articulated
in terms of their reference to the three persons of the Holy Trinity.
190 and so the Creed is divided into three parts: "the first part speaks
of the first divine Person and the wonderful work of creation; the next
speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery of his redemption
of men; the final part speaks of the third divine Person, the origin and
source of our sanctification."4 These are "the three chapters of our
[baptismal] seal".5
191 "These three parts are distinct although connected with one
another. According to a comparison often used by the Fathers, we call
them articles. Indeed, just as in our bodily members there are certain
articulations which distinguish and separate them, so too in this
profession of faith, the name "articles" has justly and rightly been given
to the truths we must believe particularly and distinctly."6 In
accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested to by St.
Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the Creed as
twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith by the
number of the apostles.7
192 Through the centuries many professions or symbols of faith have
been articulated in response to the needs of the different eras: the
creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches,8 e.g., the
Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed;9 The professions of
faith of certain Councils, such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons, Trent;10 or
the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi11 or the Credo of
the People of God of Paul VI.12
193 None of the creeds from the different stages in the Church's life
can be considered superseded or irrelevant. They help us today to
attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the different
summaries made of it.
Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church's life:
194 The Apostles' Creed is so called because it is rightly considered to
be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith. It is the ancient baptismal
symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises from this fact:
it is "the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter the first of the
apostles, to which he brought the common faith".13
195 The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its great
authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecumenical
Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the great
Churches of both East and West to this day.
196 Our presentation of the faith will follow the Apostles' Creed, which
constitutes, as it were, "the oldest Roman catechism". the presentation
will be completed however by constant references to the Nicene Creed,
which is often more explicit and more detailed.
197 As on the day of our Baptism, when our whole life was entrusted
to the "standard of teaching",14 let us embrace the Creed of our life-
giving faith. To say the Credo with faith is to enter into communion
with God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and also with the whole
Church which transmits the faith to us and in whose midst we believe:
This Creed is the spiritual seal, our heart's meditation and an ever-

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER
198 Our profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First and
the Last,1 The beginning and the end of everything. the Credo begins
with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine person of the
Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of heaven and
earth, for creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God's
works.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER




Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"
Paragraph 1. I BELIEVE IN GOD
199 "I believe in God": this first affirmation of the Apostles' Creed is
also the most fundamental. the whole Creed speaks of God, and when
it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in relation to God. the
other articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining
Commandments make the first explicit. the other articles help us to
know God better as he revealed himself progressively to men. "The
faithful first profess their belief in God."2
I. "I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD"
200 These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan
Creed begins. the confession of God's oneness, which has its roots in
the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the
profession of God's existence and is equally fundamental. God is
unique; there is only one God: "The Christian faith confesses that God
is one in nature, substance and essence."3
201 To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One: "Hear,
O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love the
LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your might."4 Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all
nations to turn to him, the one and only God: "Turn to me and be
saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.. .
To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. 'Only in the
LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength.'"5
202 Jesus himself affirms that God is "the one Lord" whom you must
love "with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
mind, and with all your strength".6 At the same time Jesus gives us to
understand that he himself is "the Lord".7 To confess that Jesus is Lord
is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not contrary to belief in the One
God. Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit as "Lord and giver of life"
introduce any division into the One God:
We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there is only one
true God, eternal infinite (immensus) and unchangeable,
incomprehensible, almighty and ineffable, the Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or
nature entirely simple.
II. GOD REVEALS HIS NAME
203 God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his name
known to them. A name expresses a person's essence and identity and
the meaning of this person's life. God has a name; he is not an
anonymous force. To disclose one's name is to make oneself known to
others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by becoming accessible,
capable of being known more intimately and addressed personally.
204 God revealed himself progressively and under different names to
his people, but the revelation that proved to be the fundamental one
for both the Old and the New Covenants was the revelation of the
divine name to Moses in the theophany of the burning bush, on the
threshold of the Exodus and of the covenant on Sinai.
The living God
205 God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that bums without
being consumed: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."9 God is the God of the
fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs in their
wanderings. He is the faithful and compassionate God who remembers
them and his promises; he comes to free their descendants from
slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time, can do this
and wills to do it, the God who will put his almighty power to work for
this plan.
"I Am who I Am"
Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them,
'The God of your fathers has sent me to you', and they ask me, 'What is
his name?' what shall I say to them?" God said to Moses, "I AM WHO
I AM." and he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me
to you'. . . this is my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered
throughout all generations."10
206 In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH ("I AM HE WHO IS",
"I AM WHO AM" or "I AM WHO I AM"), God says who he is and by
what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as
God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the
refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is -
infinitely above everything that we can understand or say: he is the
"hidden God", his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes
himself close to men.11
207 By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his
faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past
("I am the God of your father"), as for the future ("I will be with
you").12 God, who reveals his name as "I AM", reveals himself as the
God who is always there, present to his people in order to save them.
208 Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence, man
discovers his own insignificance. Before the burning bush, Moses takes
off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of God's holiness.13
Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah cries out: "Woe is me! I
am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips."14 Before the divine signs
wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful
man, O Lord."15 But because God is holy, he can forgive the man who
realizes that he is a sinner before him: "I will not execute my fierce
anger. . . for I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst."16
The apostle John says likewise: "We shall. . . reassure our hearts before
him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our
hearts, and he knows everything."17
209 Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not
pronounce his name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed
name (YHWH) is replaced by the divine title "LORD" (in Hebrew
Adonai, in Greek Kyrios). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus
will be acclaimed: "Jesus is LORD."


"A God merciful and gracious"
210 After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from God to
worship the golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of intercession and
agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, thus demonstrating
his love.18 When Moses asks to see his glory, God responds "I will
make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you
my name "the LORD" [YHWH]."19 Then the LORD passes before
Moses and proclaims, "YHWH,
YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in
steadfast love and faithfulness"; Moses then confesses that the LORD
is a forgiving God.20
211 The divine name, "I Am" or "He Is", expresses God's faithfulness:
despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punishment it deserves,
he keeps "steadfast love for thousands".21 By going so far as to give up
his own Son for us, God reveals that he is "rich in mercy".22 By giving
his life to free us from sin, Jesus reveals that he himself bears the divine
name: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will realize
that "I AM"."23
God alone IS
212 Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and deepen
realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the divine name.
God is unique; there are no other gods besides him.24
He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth:
"They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a
garment....but you are the same, and your years have no end."25
In God "there is no variation or shadow due to change."26 God is "HE
WHO IS", from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains ever
faithful to himself and to his promises.
213 The revelation of the ineffable name "I AM WHO AM" contains
then the truth that God alone IS. the Greek Septuagint translation of
the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church's Tradition,
understood the divine name in this sense: God is the fullness of Being
and of every perfection, without origin and without end. All creatures
receive all that they are and have from him; but he alone is his very
being, and he is of himself everything that he is.
III. GOD, "HE WHO IS", IS TRUTH AND LOVE
214 God, "HE WHO IS", revealed himself to Israel as the one
"abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness".27 These two terms
express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works God
displays, not only his kindness, goodness, grace and steadfast love, but
also his trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness and truth. "I give
thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness."28
He is the Truth, for "God is light and in him there is no darkness";
"God is love", as the apostle John teaches.29
God is Truth
215 "The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous
ordinances endures forever."30 "and now, O LORD God, you are God,
and your words are true";31 this is why God's promises always come
true.32 God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive. This is why
one can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of
his word in all things. the beginning of sin and of man's fall was due to
a lie of the tempter who induced doubt of God's word, kindness and
faithfulness.
216 God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created
order and governs the world.33 God, who alone made heaven and
earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created thing in
relation to himself.34
217 God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching that
comes from God is "true instruction".35 When he sends his Son into
the world it will be "to bear witness to the truth":36 "We know that the
Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him
who is true."37
God is Love
218 In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God
had only one reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive for
choosing them from among all peoples as his special possession: his
sheer gratuitous love.38 and thanks to the prophets Israel understood
that it was again out of love that God never stopped saving them and
pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.39
219 God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his son. His
love for his people is stronger than a mother's for her children. God
loves his people more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be
victorious over even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most
precious gift: "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son."40
220 God's love is "everlasting":41 "For the mountains may depart and
the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from
you."42 Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, "I have loved
you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness
to you."43
221 But St. John goes even further when he affirms that "God is
love":44 God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and the
Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost
secret:45 God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange.
IV. THE IMPLICATIONS OF FAITH IN ONE GOD
222 Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all our being
has enormous consequences for our whole life.
223 It means coming to know God's greatness and majesty: "Behold,
God is great, and we know him not."46 Therefore, we must "serve God
first".47
224 It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One, everything
we are and have comes from him: "What have you that you did not
receive?"48 "What shall I render to the LORD for all his bounty to
me?"49
225 It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: everyone
is made in the image and likeness of God.50
226 It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only
One, leads us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings
us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us
away from him:
My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me
from you.
My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you
My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you.51
227 It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in adversity. A
prayer of St. Teresa of Jesus wonderfully expresses this trust:
Let nothing trouble you / Let nothing frighten you Everything passes /
God never changes Patience / Obtains all Whoever has God / Wants for
nothing God alone is enough.52
IN BRIEF
228 "Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD..." (Dt 6:4; Mk
12:29). "The supreme being must be unique, without equal. . . If God
is not one, he is not God" (Tertullian, Adv. Marc., 1, 3, 5: PL 2, 274).
229 Faith in God leads us to turn to him alone as our first origin and
our ultimate goal, and neither to prefer anything to him nor to
substitute anything for him.
230 Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery beyond
words: "If you understood him, it would not be God" (St. Augustine,
Sermo 52, 6, 16: PL 38, 360 and Sermo 117, 3, 5: PL 38, 663).
231 The God of our faith has revealed himself as HE WHO IS; and he
has made himself known as "abounding in steadfast love and
faithfulness" (Ex 34:6). God's very being is Truth and Love.

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER
Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 2. THE FATHER
I. "IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT"
232 Christians are baptized "in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit"53 Before receiving the sacrament, they respond
to a three-part question when asked to confess the Father, the Son and
the Spirit: "I do." "The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity."54
233 Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names,55 for there is only one God,
the almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy
Trinity.
234 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of
Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is
therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that
enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching in
the "hierarchy of the truths of faith".56 The whole history of salvation
is identical with the history of the way and the means by which the one
true God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men "and
reconciles and unites with himself those who turn away from sin".57
235 This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of the
Blessed Trinity was revealed, (II) how the Church has articulated the
doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and (III) how, by the
divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfils
the "plan of his loving goodness" of creation, redemption and
sanctification.
236 The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology
(theologia) and economy (oikonomia). "Theology" refers to the
mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and "economy"
to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his
life. Through the oikonomia the theologia is revealed to us; but
conversely, the theologia illuminates the whole oikonomia. God's works
reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens
our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human
persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we
know a person, the better we understand his actions.
237 The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the
"mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless
they are revealed by God".58 To be sure, God has left traces of his
Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation
throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is
a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel's faith
before the Incarnation of God's Son and the sending of the Holy
Spirit.
II. THE REVELATION OF GOD AS TRINITY
The Father revealed by the Son
238 Many religions invoke God as "Father". the deity is often
considered the "father of gods and of men". In Israel, God is called
"Father" inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.59 Even more, God is
Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel, "his
first-born son".60 God is also called the Father of the king of Israel.
Most especially he is "the Father of the poor", of the orphaned and the
widowed, who are under his loving protection.61
239 By calling God "Father", the language of faith indicates two main
things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent
authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for
all his children. God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the
image of motherhood,62 which emphasizes God's immanence, the
intimacy between Creator and creature. the language of faith thus
draws on the human experience of parents, who are in a way the first
representatives of God for man. But this experience also tells us that
human parents are fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and
motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God transcends the
human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman:
he is God. He also transcends human fatherhood and motherhood,
although he is their origin and standard:63 no one is father as God is
Father.
240 Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is
Father not only in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his
relationship to his only Son who is eternally Son only in relation to his
Father: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows
the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him."64
241 For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God"; as "the image of the invisible God"; as the "radiance of the
glory of God and the very stamp of his nature".65


242 Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first
ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is "consubstantial"
with the Father, that is, one only God with him.66 The second
ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this
expression in its formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed "the
only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, light from
light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with
the Father".67
The Father and the son revealed by the spirit
243 Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of "another
Paraclete" (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since creation, having
previously "spoken through the prophets", the Spirit will now be with
and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them "into all the
truth".68 The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another divine person
with Jesus and the Father.
244 The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in
time. the Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the
Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had
returned to the Father.69 The sending of the person of the Spirit after
Jesus' glorification70 reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy
Trinity.
245 The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by the
second ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): "We believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the
Father."71 By this confession, the Church recognizes the Father as
"the source and origin of the whole divinity".72 But the eternal origin
of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin: "The Holy
Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and equal with the
Father and the Son, of the same substance and also of the same nature.
. . Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father alone,. . . but the Spirit of
both the Father and the Son."73 The Creed of the Church from the
Council of Constantinople confesses: "With the Father and the Son, he
is worshipped and glorified."74
246 The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit
"proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque)". the Council of
Florence in 1438 explains: "The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father
and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the
Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one
principle and through one spiration... And, since the Father has
through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that
belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally
from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Son."75
247 The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed
confessed in 381 at Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an
ancient Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had already confessed it
dogmatically in 447,76 even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of
Chalcedon, came to recognize and receive the Symbol of 381. the use
of this formula in the Creed was gradually admitted into the Latin
liturgy (between the eighth and eleventh centuries). the introduction of
the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin
liturgy constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with
the Orthodox Churches.
248 At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character
as first origin of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he "who
proceeds from the Father", it affirms that he comes from the Father
through the Son.77 The Western tradition expresses first the
consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the
Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque). It says this,
"legitimately and with good reason",78 for the eternal order of the
divine persons in their consubstantial communion implies that the
Father, as "the principle without principle",79 is the first origin of the
Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the
single principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.80 This legitimate
complementarity, provided it does not become rigid, does not affect
the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.
III. THE HOLY TRINITY IN THE TEACHING OF THE FAITH
The formation of the Trinitarian dogma
249 From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has
been at the very root of the Church's living faith, principally by means
of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of baptismal faith,
formulated in the preaching, catechesis and prayer of the Church.
Such formulations are already found in the apostolic writings, such as
this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic liturgy: "The grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy
Spirit be with you all."81


250 During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify her
Trinitarian faith, both to deepen her own understanding of the faith
and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This
clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the theological
work of the Church Fathers and sustained by the Christian people's
sense of the faith.
251 In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to
develop her own terminology with the help of certain notions of
philosophical origin: "substance", "person" or "hypostasis", "relation"
and so on. In doing this, she did not submit the faith to human
wisdom, but gave a new and unprecedented meaning to these terms,
which from then on would be used to signify an ineffable mystery,
"infinitely beyond all that we can humanly understand".82
252 The Church uses (I) the term "substance" (rendered also at times
by "essence" or "nature") to designate the divine being in its unity, (II)
the term "person" or "hypostasis" to designate the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III) the term
"relation" to designate the fact that their distinction lies in the
relationship of each to the others.
The dogma of the Holy Trinity
253 The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in
three persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".83 The divine persons do
not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God
whole and entire: "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that
which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit
is, i.e. by nature one God."84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran
Council (1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the
divine substance, essence or nature."85
254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is
one but not solitary."86 "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply
names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really
distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is
the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the
Father or the Son."87 They are distinct from one another in their
relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is
begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."88 The divine Unity is
Triune.
255 The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not
divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one
another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one
another: "In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to
the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they
are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one
nature or substance."89 Indeed "everything (in them) is one where
there is no opposition of relationship."90 "Because of that unity the
Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is
wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is
wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son."91
256 St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called "the Theologian", entrusts
this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of
Constantinople:
Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which I live and
fight, which I want to take with me as a companion, and which makes
me bear all evils and despise all pleasures: I mean the profession of
faith in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you
today. By it I am soon going to plunge you into water and raise you up
from it. I give it to you as the companion and patron of your whole life.
I give you but one divinity and power, existing one in three, and
containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without disparity of
substance or nature, without superior degree that raises up or inferior
degree that casts down. . . the infinite co-naturality of three infinites.
Each person considered in himself is entirely God. . . the three
considered together. . . I have not even begun to think of unity when
the Trinity bathes me in its splendour. I have not even begun to think
of the Trinity when unity grasps me. .92
IV. THE DIVINE WORKS AND THE TRINITARIAN MISSIONS
257 "O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!"93 God is eternal
blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love: Father, Son and
Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the glory of his blessed
life. Such is the "plan of his loving kindness", conceived by the Father
before the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: "He destined us
in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son",
through "the spirit of sonship".94 This plan is a "grace [which] was
given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began", stemming
immediately from Trinitarian love.95 It unfolds in the work of creation,
the whole history of salvation after the fall, and the missions of the Son
and the Spirit, which are continued in the mission of the Church.96
258 The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine
persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too
does it have only one and the same operation: "The Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one
principle."97 However, each divine person performs the common work
according to his unique personal property. Thus the Church confesses,
following the New Testament, "one God and Father from whom all
things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are,
and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are".98 It is above all the divine
missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that
show forth the properties of the divine persons.
259 Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine
economy makes known both what is proper to the divine persons, and
their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life is a communion
with each of the divine persons, without in any way separating them.
Everyone who glorifies the Father does so through the Son in the Holy
Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does so because the Father draws
him and the Spirit moves him.99
260 The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of
God's creatures into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.100 But
even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy Trinity: "If a
man loves me", says the Lord, "he will keep my word, and my Father
will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with
him":101
O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to
establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were
already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble my peace or make
me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me
more deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your
heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest. May I never
abandon you there, but may I be there, whole and entire, completely
vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given over to your
creative action.102
IN BRIEF
261 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the
Christian faith and of Christian life. God alone can make it known to
us by revealing himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
262 The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the eternal
Father and that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, which means
that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is one and the same
God.
263 The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of
the Son (Jn 14:26) and by the Son "from the Father" (Jn 15:26),
reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. "With the
Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified" (Nicene Creed).
264 "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle
and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from the communion of both
the Father and the Son" (St. Augustine, De Trin. 15, 26, 47: PL 42,
1095).
265 By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit", we are called to share in the life of the Blessed
Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after death in
eternal light (cf. Paul VI, CPG # 9).
266 "Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity
and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or
dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is
another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son
and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal"
(Athanasian Creed: DS 75; ND 16).
267 Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also
inseparable in what they do. But within the single divine operation
each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, especially in the
divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER




Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 3. THE ALMIGHTY
268 of all the divine attributes, only God's omnipotence is named in
the Creed: to confess this power has great bearing on our lives. We
believe that his might is universal, for God who created everything also
rules everything and can do everything. God's power is loving, for he is
our Father, and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it "is
made perfect in weakness".103
"He does whatever he pleases"104
269 The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal power of
God. He is called the "Mighty One of Jacob", the "LORD of hosts",
the "strong and mighty" one. If God is almighty "in heaven and on
earth", it is because he made them.105 Nothing is impossible with
God, who disposes his works according to his will.106 He is the Lord
of the universe, whose order he established and which remains wholly
subject to him and at his disposal. He is master of history, governing
hearts and events in keeping with his will: "It is always in your power to
show great strength, and who can withstand the strength of your
arm?107
"You are merciful to all, for you can do all thing"108
270 God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power shed
light on one another: God reveals his fatherly omnipotence by the way
he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he gives us ("I will
be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the
Lord Almighty"):109 finally by his infinite mercy, for he displays his
power at its height by freely forgiving sins.
271 God's almighty power is in no way arbitrary: "In God, power,
essence, will, intellect, wisdom, and justice are all identical. Nothing
therefore can be in God's power which could not be in his just will or
his wise intellect."110
The mystery of God's apparent powerlessness
272 Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by the
experience of evil and suffering. God can sometimes seem to be absent
and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysterious way God
the Father has revealed his almighty power in the voluntary
humiliation and Resurrection of his Son, by which he conquered evil.
Christ crucified is thus "the power of God and the wisdom of God. For
the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is
stronger than men."111 It is in Christ's Resurrection and exaltation
that the Father has shown forth "the immeasurable greatness of his
power in us who believe".112
273 Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God's almighty
power. This faith glories in its weaknesses in order to draw to itself
Christ's power.113 The Virgin Mary is the supreme model of this faith,
for she believed that "nothing will be impossible with God", and was
able to magnify the Lord: "For he who is mighty has done great things
for me, and holy is his name."114
274 "Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding
it fixed in our minds that nothing is impossible with God. Once our
reason has grasped the idea of God's almighty power, it will easily and
without any hesitation admit everything that [the Creed] will
afterwards propose for us to believe - even if they be great and
marvellous things, far above the ordinary laws of nature."115
IN BRIEF
275 With Job, the just man, we confess: "I know that you can do all
things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted" (Job 42:2).
276 Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses
her prayer to the "almighty and eternal God" (“omnipotens sempiterne
Deus. . ."), believing firmly that "nothing will be impossible with God"
(Gen 18:14; Lk 1:37; Mt 19:26).
277 God shows forth his almighty power by converting us from our
sins and restoring us to his friendship by grace. "God, you show your
almighty power above all in your mercy and forgiveness. . ." (Roman
Missal, 26th Sunday, Opening Prayer).
278 If we do not believe that God's love is almighty, how can we
believe that the Father could create us, the Son redeem us and the
Holy Spirit sanctify us?

CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER
Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 4. THE CREATOR
279 "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."116 oly
Scripture begins with these solemn words. the profession of faith takes
them up when it confesses that God the Father almighty is "Creator of
heaven and earth" (Apostles' Creed), "of all that is, seen and unseen"
(Nicene Creed). We shall speak first of the Creator, then of creation
and finally of the fall into sin from which Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
came to raise us up again.
280 Creation is the foundation of "all God's saving plans," the
"beginning of the history of salvation"117 that culminates in Christ.
Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the mystery
of creation and reveals the end for which "in the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth": from the beginning, God envisaged
the glory of the new creation in Christ.118
281 And so the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the new
creation in Christ, begin with the creation account; likewise in the
Byzantine liturgy, the account of creation always constitutes the first
reading at the vigils of the great feasts of the Lord. According to
ancient witnesses the instruction of catechumens for Baptism followed
the same itinerary.119
I. CATECHESIS ON CREATION
282 Catechesis on creation is of major importance. It concerns the
very foundations of human and Christian life: for it makes explicit the
response of the Christian faith to the basic question that men of all
times have asked themselves:120 "Where do we come from?" "Where
are we going?" "What is our origin?" "What is our end?" "Where does
everything that exists come from and where is it going?" the two
questions, the first about the origin and the second about the end, are
inseparable. They are decisive for the meaning and orientation of our
life and actions.
283 The question about the origins of the world and of man has been
the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched
our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the
development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These
discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the
Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the
understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers. With
Solomon they can say: "It is he who gave me unerring knowledge of
what exists, to know the structure of the world and the activity of the
elements. . . for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me."121
284 The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated
by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain
of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and
how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of
discovering the meaning of such an origin: is the universe governed by
chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent,
intelligent and good Being called "God"? and if the world does come
from God's wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where does it
come from? Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it?
285 Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by
responses to the question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient
religions and cultures produced many myths concerning origins. Some
philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God,
or that the development of the world is the development of God
(Pantheism). Others have said that the world is a necessary emanation
arising from God and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the
existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and
Darkness, locked, in permanent conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism).
According to some of these conceptions, the world (at least the
physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected
or left behind (Gnosticism). Some admit that the world was made by
God, but as by a watch-maker who, once he has made a watch,
abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent
origin for the world, but see it as merely the interplay of matter that
has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts bear witness to the
permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is
distinctively human.
286 Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response
to the question of origins. the existence of God the Creator can be
known with certainty through his works, by the light of human
reason,122 even if this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by
error. This is why faith comes to confirm and enlighten reason in the
correct understanding of this truth: "By faith we understand that the
world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made
out of things which do not appear."123
287 The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that
God in his tenderness wanted to reveal to his People everything that is
salutary to know on the subject. Beyond the natural knowledge that
every man can have of the Creator,124 God progressively revealed to
Israel the mystery of creation. He who chose the patriarchs, who
brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by choosing Israel created and
formed it, this same God reveals himself as the One to whom belong
all the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he is the One
who alone "made heaven and earth".125
288 Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation
and forging of the covenant of the one God with his People. Creation
is revealed as the first step towards this covenant, the first and
universal witness to God's all-powerful love.126 and so, the truth of
creation is also expressed with growing vigour in the message of the
prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy, and in the wisdom
sayings of the Chosen People.127
289 Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three
chapters of Genesis occupy a unique place. From a literary standpoint
these texts may have had diverse sources. the inspired authors have
placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express in their solemn
language the truths of creation - its origin and its end in God, its order
and goodness, the vocation of man, and finally the drama of sin and
the hope of salvation. Read in the light of Christ, within the unity of
Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the Church, these texts
remain the principal source for catechesis on the mysteries of the
"beginning": creation, fall, and promise of salvation.
II. CREATION - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY
290 "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth":128
three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture: the eternal
God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he alone is
Creator (the verb "create" - Hebrew bara - always has God for its
subject). the totality of what exists (expressed by the formula "the
heavens and the earth") depends on the One who gives it being.
291 "In the beginning was the Word. . . and the Word was God. . . all
things were made through him, and without him was not anything
made that was made."129 The New Testament reveals that God
created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him "all
things were created, in heaven and on earth.. . all things were created
through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things
hold together."130 The Church's faith likewise confesses the creative
action of the Holy Spirit, the "giver of life", "the Creator Spirit" (Veni,
Creator Spiritus), the "source of every good".131
292 The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant reveals the
creative action of the Son and the Spirit,132 inseparably one with that
of the Father. This creative co-operation is clearly affirmed in the
Church's rule of faith: "There exists but one God. . . he is the Father,
God, the Creator, the author, the giver of order. He made all things by
himself, that is, by his Word and by his Wisdom", "by the Son and the
Spirit" who, so to speak, are "his hands".133 Creation is the common
work of the Holy Trinity.
III. "THE WORLD WAS CREATED FOR THE GLORY OF GOD"
293 Scripture and Tradition never cease to teach and celebrate this
fundamental truth: "The world was made for the glory of God."134 St.
Bonaventure explains that God created all things "not to increase his
glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it",135 for God has no
other reason for creating than his love and goodness: "Creatures came
into existence when the key of love opened his hand."136 The First
Vatican Council explains:
This one, true God, of his own goodness and "almighty power", not for
increasing his own beatitude, nor for attaining his perfection, but in
order to manifest this perfection through the benefits which he bestows
on creatures, with absolute freedom of counsel "and from the
beginning of time, made out of nothing both orders of creatures, the
spiritual and the corporeal. . ."137
294 The glory of God consists in the realization of this manifestation
and communication of his goodness, for which the world was created.
God made us "to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the
purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace",138 for "the
glory of God is man fully alive; moreover man's life is the vision of
God: if God's revelation through creation has already obtained life for
all the beings that dwell on earth, how much more will the Word's
manifestation of the Father obtain life for those who see God."139 The
ultimate purpose of creation is that God "who is the creator of all
things may at last become "all in all", thus simultaneously assuring his
own glory and our beatitude."140
IV. THE MYSTERY OF CREATION
God creates by wisdom and love
295 We believe that God created the world according to his
wisdom.141 It is not the product of any necessity whatever, nor of
blind fate or chance. We believe that it proceeds from God's free will;
he wanted to make his creatures share in his being, wisdom and
goodness: "For you created all things, and by your will they existed and
were created."142 Therefore the Psalmist exclaims: "O LORD, how
manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all"; and
"The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over all that he has
made."143 God creates "out of nothing"
296 We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in
order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from
the divine substance.144 God creates freely "out of nothing":145
If God had drawn the world from pre-existent matter, what would be
so extraordinary in that? A human artisan makes from a given material
whatever he wants, while God shows his power by starting from
nothing to make all he wants.146
297 Scripture bears witness to faith in creation "out of nothing" as a
truth full of promise and hope. Thus the mother of seven sons
encourages them for martyrdom:
I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who
gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within
each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the
beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy
give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves
for the sake of his laws. . . Look at the heaven and the earth and see
everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them
out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.147
298 Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also,
through the Holy Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure
heart in them,148 and bodily life to the dead through the
Resurrection. God "gives life to the dead and calls into existence the
things that do not exist."149 and since God was able to make light
shine in darkness by his Word, he can also give the light of faith to
those who do not yet know him.150
God creates an ordered and good world
299 Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered:
"You have arranged all things by measure and number and weight."151
The universe, created in and by the eternal Word, the "image of the
invisible God", is destined for and addressed to man, himself created in
the "image of God" and called to a personal relationship with God.152
Our human understanding, which shares in the light of the divine
intellect, can understand what God tells us by means of his creation,
though not without great effort and only in a spirit of humility and
respect before the Creator and his work.153 Because creation comes
forth from God's goodness, it shares in that goodness - "and God saw
that it was good. . . very good"154- for God willed creation as a gift
addressed to man, an inheritance destined for and entrusted to him.
On many occasions the Church has had to defend the goodness of
creation, including that of the physical world.155
God transcends creation and is present to it
300 God is infinitely greater than all his works: "You have set your
glory above the heavens."156 Indeed, God's "greatness is
unsearchable".157 But because he is the free and sovereign Creator,
the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures' inmost
being: "In him we live and move and have our being."158 In the words
of St. Augustine, God is "higher than my highest and more inward than
my innermost self".159
God upholds and sustains creation
301 With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves.
He not only gives them being and existence, but also, and at every
moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and
brings them to their final end. Recognizing this utter dependence with
respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and
confidence:


For you love all things that exist, and detest none of the things that you
have made; for you would not have made anything if you had hated it.
How would anything have endured, if you had not willed it? Or how
would anything not called forth by you have been preserved? You spare
all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the living.160
V. GOD CARRIES OUT HIS PLAN: DIVINE PROVIDENCE
302 Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did
not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator. the universe
was created "in a state of journeying" (in statu viae) toward an ultimate
perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call
"divine providence" the dispositions by which God guides his creation
toward this perfection:
By his providence God protects and governs all things which he has
made, "reaching mightily from one end of the earth to the other, and
ordering all things well". For "all are open and laid bare to his eyes",
even those things which are yet to come into existence through the free
action of creatures.161
303 The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude of divine
providence is concrete and immediate; God cares for all, from the least
things to the great events of the world and its history. the sacred books
powerfully affirm God's absolute sovereignty over the course of events:
"Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases."162 and so it
is with Christ, "who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no
one opens".163 As the book of Proverbs states: "Many are the plans in
the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be
established."164
304 And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred
Scripture, often attributing actions to God without mentioning any
secondary causes. This is not a "primitive mode of speech", but a
profound way of recalling God's primacy and absolute Lordship over
history and the world,165 and so of educating his people to trust in
him. the prayer of the Psalms is the great school of this trust.166
305 Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our
heavenly Father who takes care of his children's smallest needs:
"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What
shall we drink?". . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be yours as well."167
Providence and secondary causes
306 God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out he also
makes use of his creatures' co-operation. This use is not a sign of
weakness, but rather a token of almighty God's greatness and
goodness. For God grants his creatures not only their existence, but
also the dignity of acting on their own, of being causes and principles
for each other, and thus of co-operating in the accomplishment of his
plan.
307 To human beings God even gives the power of freely sharing in his
providence by entrusting them with the responsibility of "subduing"
the earth and having dominion over it.168 God thus enables men to be
intelligent and free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to
perfect its harmony for their own good and that of their neighbours.
Though often unconscious collaborators with God's will, they can also
enter deliberately into the divine plan by their actions, their prayers
and their sufferings.169 They then fully become "God's fellow
workers" and co-workers for his kingdom.170
308 The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is
inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the first cause who
operates in and through secondary causes: "For God is at work in you,
both to will and to work for his good pleasure."171 Far from
diminishing the creature's dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from
nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing
if it is cut off from its origin, for "without a Creator the creature
vanishes."172 Still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without
the help of God's grace.173
Providence and the scandal of evil
309 If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good
world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question,
as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no
quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes
the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin
and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants,
the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his
gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a
blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance,
but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in
advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is
not in part an answer to the question of evil.
310 But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil could
exist in it? With infinite power God could always create something
better.174 But with infinite wisdom and goodness God freely willed to
create a world "in a state of journeying" towards its ultimate perfection.
In God's plan this process of becoming involves the appearance of
certain beings and the disappearance of others, the existence of the
more perfect alongside the less perfect, both constructive and
destructive forces of nature. With physical good there exists also
physical evil as long as creation has not reached perfection.175
311 Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey
toward their ultimate destinies by their free choice and preferential
love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have sinned. Thus has
moral evil, incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered
the world. God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral
evil.176 He permits it, however, because he respects the freedom of his
creatures and, mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it:
For almighty God. . ., because he is supremely good, would never allow
any evil whatsoever to exist in his works if he were not so all-powerful
and good as to cause good to emerge from evil itself.177
312 In time we can discover that God in his almighty providence can
bring a good from the consequences of an evil, even a moral evil,
caused by his creatures: "It was not you", said Joseph to his brothers,
"who sent me here, but God. . . You meant evil against me; but God
meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept
alive."178 From the greatest moral evil ever committed - the rejection
and murder of God's only Son, caused by the sins of all men - God, by
his grace that "abounded all the more",179 brought the greatest of
goods: the glorification of Christ and our redemption. But for all that,
evil never becomes a good.
313 "We know that in everything God works for good for those who
love him."180 The constant witness of the saints confirms this truth:
St. Catherine of Siena said to "those who are scandalized and rebel
against what happens to them": "Everything comes from love, all is
ordained for the salvation of man, God does nothing without this goal
in mind."181
St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled his
daughter: "Nothing can come but that that God wills. and I make me
very sure that whatsoever that be, seem it never so bad in sight, it shall
indeed be the best."182
Dame Julian of Norwich: "Here I was taught by the grace of God that I
should steadfastly keep me in the faith... and that at the same time I
should take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord
shewed in this time - that 'all manner (of) thing shall be well.'"183
314 We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history.
But the ways of his providence are often unknown to us. Only at the
end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we see God "face to
face",184 will we fully know the ways by which - even through the
dramas of evil and sin - God has guided his creation to that definitive
sabbath rest185 for which he created heaven and earth.
IN BRIEF
315 In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the first and
universal witness to his almighty love and his wisdom, the first
proclamation of the "plan of his loving goodness", which finds its goal
in the new creation in Christ.
316 Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father in
particular, it is equally a truth of faith that the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of creation.
317 God alone created the universe, freely, directly and without any
help.
318 No creature has the infinite power necessary to "create" in the
proper sense of the word, that is, to produce and give being to that
which had in no way possessed it to call into existence "out of
nothing") (cf DS 3624).
319 God created the world to show forth and communicate his glory.
That his creatures should share in his truth, goodness and beauty - this
is the glory for which God created them.
320 God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his Word, the
Son "upholding the universe by his word of power" (Heb 1:3), and by
his Creator Spirit, the giver of life.
321 Divine providence consists of the dispositions by which God
guides all his creatures with wisdom and love to their ultimate end.
322 Christ invites us to filial trust in the providence of our heavenly
Father (cf Mt 6:26-34), and St. Peter the apostle repeats: "Cast all your
anxieties on him, for he cares about you" (I Pt 5:7; cf. Ps 55:23).
323 Divine providence works also through the actions of creatures. To
human beings God grants the ability to co-operate freely with his
plans.
324 The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil is a
mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus Christ who died and
rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives us the certainty that God would not
permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very evil,
by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS
CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER




Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 5. HEAVEN AND EARTH
325 The Apostles' Creed professes that God is "creator of heaven and
earth". the Nicene Creed makes it explicit that this profession includes
"all that is, seen and unseen".
326 The Scriptural expression "heaven and earth" means all that exists,
creation in its entirety. It also indicates the bond, deep within creation,
that both unites heaven and earth and distinguishes the one from the
other: "the earth" is the world of men, while "heaven" or "the heavens"
can designate both the firmament and God's own "place" - "our Father
in heaven" and consequently the "heaven" too which is eschatological
glory. Finally, "heaven" refers to the saints and the "place" of the
spiritual creatures, the angels, who surround God.186
327 The profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215)
affirms that God "from the beginning of time made at once (simul) out
of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal,
that is, the angelic and the earthly, and then (deinde) the human
creature, who as it were shares in both orders, being composed of spirit
and body."187
I. THE ANGELS
The existence of angels - a truth of faith
328 The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred
Scripture usually calls "angels" is a truth of faith. the witness of
Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition.
Who are they?
329 St. Augustine says: "'Angel' is the name of their office, not of their
nature. If you seek the name of their nature, it is 'spirit'; if you seek the
name of their office, it is 'angel': from what they are, 'spirit', from what
they do, 'angel.'"188 With their whole beings the angels are servants
and messengers of God. Because they "always behold the face of my
Father who is in heaven" they are the "mighty ones who do his word,
hearkening to the voice of his word".189
330 As purely spiritual creatures angels have intelligence and will: they
are personal and immortal creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible
creatures, as the splendour of their glory bears witness.190
Christ "with all his angels"
331 Christ is the centre of the angelic world. They are his angels:
"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him.
. "191 They belong to him because they were created through and for
him: "for in him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible
and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or
authorities - all things were created through him and for him."192
They belong to him still more because he has made them messengers
of his saving plan: "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to
serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?"193
332 Angels have been present since creation and throughout the
history of salvation, announcing this salvation from afar or near and
serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the earthly
paradise; protected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed Abraham's
hand; communicated the law by their ministry; led the People of God;
announced births and callings; and assisted the prophets, just to cite a
few examples.194 Finally, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of the
Precursor and that of Jesus himself.195
333 From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word
incarnate is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels. When
God "brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all God's angels
worship him.'"196 Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not
ceased resounding in the Church's praise: "Glory to God in the
highest!"197 They protect Jesus in his infancy, serve him in the desert,
strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have been
saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been.198
Again, it is the angels who "evangelize" by proclaiming the Good News
of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection.199 They will be present at
Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his
judgement.200
The angels in the life of the Church
334 In the meantime, the whole life of the Church benefits from the
mysterious and powerful help of angels.201
335 In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-
holy God. She invokes their assistance (in the funeral liturgy's In
Paradisum deducant te angeli...["May the angels lead you into
Paradise. . ."]). Moreover, in the "Cherubic Hymn" of the Byzantine
Liturgy, she celebrates the memory of certain angels more particularly
(St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, and the guardian angels).
336 From the beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their
watchful care and intercession.202 "Beside each believer stands an
angel as protector and shepherd leading him to life."203 Already here
on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of
angels and men united in God.
II. THE VISIBLE WORLD
337 God himself created the visible world in all its richness, diversity
and order. Scripture presents the work of the Creator symbolically as a
succession of six days of divine "work", concluded by the "rest" of the
seventh day.204 On the subject of creation, the sacred text teaches the
truths revealed by God for our salvation,205 permitting us to
"recognize the inner nature, the value and the ordering of the whole of
creation to the praise of God."206
338 Nothing exists that does not owe its existence to God the Creator.
the world began when God's word drew it out of nothingness; all
existent beings, all of nature, and all human history are rooted in this
primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was constituted
and time begun.207
339 Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and
perfection. For each one of the works of the "six days" it is said: "and
God saw that it was good." "By the very nature of creation, material
being is endowed with its own stability, truth and excellence, its own
order and laws."208 Each of the various creatures, willed in its own
being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom and
goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every
creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which would be in
contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous consequences for
human beings and their environment.
340 God wills the interdependence of creatures. the sun and the moon,
the cedar and the little flower, the eagle and the sparrow: the spectacle
of their countless diversities and inequalities tells us that no creature is
self-sufficient. Creatures exist only in dependence on each other, to
complete each other, in the service of each other.
341 The beauty of the universe: the order and harmony of the created
world results from the diversity of beings and from the relationships
which exist among them. Man discovers them progressively as the laws
of nature. They call forth the admiration of scholars. the beauty of
creation reflects the infinite beauty of the Creator and ought to inspire
the respect and submission of man's intellect and will.
342 The hierarchy of creatures is expressed by the order of the "six
days", from the less perfect to the more perfect. God loves all his
creatures209 and takes care of each one, even the sparrow.
Nevertheless, Jesus said: "You are of more value than many sparrows",
or again: "of how much more value is a man than a sheep!"210
343 Man is the summit of the Creator's work, as the inspired account
expresses by clearly distinguishing the creation of man from that of the
other creatures.211
344 There is a solidarity among all creatures arising from the fact that
all have the same Creator and are all ordered to his glory: May you be
praised, O Lord, in all your creatures, especially brother sun, by whom
you give us light for the day; he is beautiful, radiating great splendour,
and offering us a symbol of you, the Most High. . .
May you be praised, my Lord, for sister water, who is very useful and
humble, precious and chaste.
May you be praised, my Lord, for sister earth, our mother, who bears
and feeds us, and produces the variety of fruits and dappled flowers
and grasses. . .
Praise and bless my Lord, give thanks and serve him in all humility.212
345 The sabbath - the end of the work of the six days. the sacred text
says that "on the seventh day God finished his work which he had
done", that the "heavens and the earth were finished", and that God
"rested" on this day and sanctified and blessed it.213 These inspired
words are rich in profitable instruction:
346 In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that remain
firm, on which the believer can rely with confidence, for they are the
sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God's covenant.214
For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation, and respect
the laws which the Creator has written into it.
347 Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore
for the worship and adoration of God. Worship is inscribed in the order
of creation.215 As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing should take
precedence over "the work of God", that is, solemn worship.216 This
indicates the right order of human concerns.
348 The sabbath is at the heart of Israel's law. To keep the
commandments is to correspond to the wisdom and the will of God as
expressed in his work of creation.
349 The eighth day. But for us a new day has dawned: the day of
Christ's Resurrection. the seventh day completes the first creation. the
eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of creation
culminates in the greater work of redemption. the first creation finds its
meaning and its summit in the new creation in Christ, the splendour of
which surpasses that of the first creation.217
IN BRIEF
350 Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God without ceasing and
who serve his saving plans for other creatures: "The angels work
together for the benefit of us all" (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I, 114, 3,
ad 3).
351 The angels surround Christ their Lord. They serve him especially
in the accomplishment of his saving mission to men.
352 The Church venerates the angels who help her on her earthly
pilgrimage and protect every human being.
353 God willed the diversity of his creatures and their own particular
goodness, their interdependence and their order. He destined all
material creatures for the good of the human race. Man, and through
him all creation, is destined for the glory of God.


354 Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations which
derive from the nature of things is a principle of wisdom and a
foundation for morality.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS
CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER




Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 6. MAN
355 "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he
created him, male and female he created them."218 Man occupies a
unique place in creation: (I) he is "in the image of God"; (II) in his
own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III) he is
created "male and female"; (IV) God established him in his friendship.
I. "IN THE IMAGE OF GOD"
356 of all visible creatures only man is "able to know and love his
creator".219 He is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for
its own sake",220 and he alone is called to share, by knowledge and
love, in God's own life. It was for this end that he was created, and this
is the fundamental reason for his dignity:
What made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the
incalculable love by which you have looked on your creature in
yourself! You are taken with love for her; for by love indeed you created
her, by love you have given her a being capable of tasting your eternal
Good.221
357 Being in the image of God the human individual possesses the
dignity of a person, who is not just something, but someone. He is
capable of self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely giving
himself and entering into communion with other persons. and he is
called by grace to a covenant with his Creator, to offer him a response
of faith and love that no other creature can give in his stead.
358 God created everything for man,222 but man in turn was created
to serve and love God and to offer all creation back to him:
What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honour? It is
man that great and wonderful living creature, more precious in the eyes
of God than all other creatures! For him the heavens and the earth, the
sea and all the rest of creation exist. God attached so much importance
to his salvation that he did not spare his own Son for the sake of man.
Nor does he ever cease to work, trying every possible means, until he
has raised man up to himself and made him sit at his right hand.223
359 "In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the
mystery of man truly becomes clear."224
St. Paul tells us that the human race takes its origin from two men:
Adam and Christ. . . the first man, Adam, he says, became a living
soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. the first Adam was made by the
last Adam, from whom he also received his soul, to give him life... the
second Adam stamped his image on the first Adam when he created
him. That is why he took on himself the role and the name of the first
Adam, in order that he might not lose what he had made in his own
image. the first Adam, the last Adam: the first had a beginning, the last
knows no end. the last Adam is indeed the first; as he himself says: "I
am the first and the last."225
360 Because of its common origin the human race forms a unity, for
"from one ancestor (God) made all nations to inhabit the whole
earth":226
O wondrous vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in
the unity of its origin in God. . . in the unity of its nature, composed
equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity
of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its
dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use
to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end: God
himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for
attaining this end;. . . in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ
for all.227
361 "This law of human solidarity and charity",228 without excluding
the rich variety of persons, cultures and peoples, assures us that all
men are truly brethren.
II. "BODY AND SOUL BUT TRULY ONE"
362 The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once
corporeal and spiritual. the biblical account expresses this reality in
symbolic language when it affirms that "then the LORD God formed
man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living being."229 Man, whole and entire, is
therefore willed by God.
363 In Sacred Scripture the term "soul" often refers to human life or
the entire human person.230 But "soul" also refers to the innermost
aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him,231 that by which
he is most especially in God's image: "soul" signifies the spiritual
principle in man.
364 The human body shares in the dignity of "the image of God": it is
a human body precisely because it is animated by a spiritual soul, and
it is the whole human person that is intended to become, in the body
of Christ, a temple of the Spirit:232
Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity. Through his very
bodily condition he sums up in himself the elements of the material
world. Through him they are thus brought to their highest perfection
and can raise their voice in praise freely given to the Creator. For this
reason man may not despise his bodily life. Rather he is obliged to
regard his body as good and to hold it in honour since God has created
it and will raise it up on the last day 233
365 The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to consider
the soul to be the "form" of the body:234 i.e., it is because of its
spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living, human
body; spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united, but rather
their union forms a single nature.
366 The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created
immediately by God - it is not "produced" by the parents - and also
that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body
at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final
Resurrection.235
367 Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul for
instance prays that God may sanctify his people "wholly", with "spirit
and soul and body" kept sound and blameless at the Lord's
coming.236 The Church teaches that this distinction does not
introduce a duality into the soul.237 "Spirit" signifies that from
creation man is ordered to a supernatural end and that his soul can
gratuitously be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with
God.238
368 The spiritual tradition of the Church also emphasizes the heart, in
the biblical sense of the depths of one's being, where the person
decides for or against God.239
III. "MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM"
Equality and difference willed by God
369 Man and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by
God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on the
other, in their respective beings as man and woman. "Being man" or
"being woman" is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and
woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them
immediately from God their Creator.240 Man and woman are both
with one and the same dignity "in the image of God". In their "being-
man" and "being-woman", they reflect the Creator's wisdom and
goodness.
370 In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman.
God is pure spirit in which there is no place for the difference between
the sexes. But the respective "perfections" of man and woman reflect
something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and
those of a father and husband.241
"Each for the other" - "A unity in two"
371 God created man and woman together and willed each for the
other. the Word of God gives us to understand this through various
features of the sacred text. "It is not good that the man should be
alone. I will make him a helper fit for him."242 None of the animals
can be man's partner.243 The woman God "fashions" from the man's
rib and brings to him elicits on the man's part a cry of wonder, an
exclamation of love and communion: "This at last is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh."244 Man discovers woman as another "I",
sharing the same humanity.
372 Man and woman were made "for each other" - not that God left
them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion
of persons, in which each can be "helpmate" to the other, for they are
equal as persons ("bone of my bones. . .") and complementary as
masculine and feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way
that, by forming "one flesh",245 they can transmit human life: "Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."246 By transmitting human life
to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents co-
operate in a unique way in the Creator's work.247
373 In God's plan man and woman have the vocation of "subduing"
the earth248 as stewards of God. This sovereignty is not to be an
arbitrary and destructive domination. God calls man and woman,
made in the image of the Creator "who loves everything that
exists",249 to share in his providence toward other creatures; hence
their responsibility for the world God has entrusted to them.
IV. MAN IN PARADISE
374 The first man was not only created good, but was also established
in friendship with his Creator and in harmony with himself and with
the creation around him, in a state that would be surpassed only by the
glory of the new creation in Christ.
375 The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical language in an
authentic way, in the light of the New Testament and Tradition, teaches
that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were constituted in an original
"state of holiness and justice".250 This grace of original holiness was
"to share in. . .divine life".251
376 By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life were
confirmed. As long as he remained in the divine intimacy, man would
not have to suffer or die.252 The inner harmony of the human person,
the harmony between man and woman,253 and finally the harmony
between the first couple and all creation, comprised the state called
"original justice".
377 The "mastery" over the world that God offered man from the
beginning was realized above all within man himself: mastery of self.
the first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole being because
he was free from the triple concupiscence254 that subjugates him to
the pleasures of the senses, covetousness for earthly goods, and self-
assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason.
378 The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places him in
the garden.255 There he lives "to till it and keep it". Work is not yet a
burden,256 but rather the collaboration of man and woman with God
in perfecting the visible creation.
379 This entire harmony of original justice, foreseen for man in God's
plan, will be lost by the sin of our first parents.
IN BRIEF
380 "Father,. . . you formed man in your own likeness and set him over
the whole world to serve you, his creator, and to rule over all creatures"
(Roman Missal, EP IV, 118).
381 Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God's Son made
man, the "image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15), so that Christ shall
be the first-born of a multitude of brothers and sisters (cf Eph 1:3-6;
Rom 8:29).
382 "Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity" (GS 14 # 1). the
doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is
created immediately by God.
383 "God did not create man a solitary being. From the beginning,
"male and female he created them" (Gen 1:27). This partnership of
man and woman constitutes the first form of communion between
persons" (GS 12 # 4).
384 Revelation makes known to us the state of original holiness and
justice of man and woman before sin: from their friendship with God
flowed the happiness of their existence in paradise.

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER ONE I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER




Article 1 "I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH"




Paragraph 7. THE FALL
385 God is infinitely good and all his works are good. Yet no one can
escape the experience of suffering or the evils in nature which seem to
be linked to the limitations proper to creatures: and above all to the
question of moral evil. Where does evil come from? "I sought whence
evil comes and there was no solution", said St. Augustine,257 and his
own painful quest would only be resolved by his conversion to the
living God. For "the mystery of lawlessness" is clarified only in the light
of the "mystery of our religion".258 The revelation of divine love in
Christ manifested at the same time the extent of evil and the
superabundance of grace.259 We must therefore approach the question
of the origin of evil by fixing the eyes of our faith on him who alone is
its conqueror.260
I. WHERE SIN ABOUNDED, GRACE ABOUNDED ALL THE
MORE
The reality of sin
386 Sin is present in human history; any attempt to ignore it or to give
this dark reality other names would be futile. To try to understand
what sin is, one must first recognize the profound relation of man to
God, for only in this relationship is the evil of sin unmasked in its true
identity as humanity's rejection of God and opposition to him, even as
it continues to weigh heavy on human life and history.
387 Only the light of divine Revelation clarifies the reality of sin and
particularly of the sin committed at mankind's origins. Without the
knowledge Revelation gives of God we cannot recognize sin clearly and
are tempted to explain it as merely a developmental flaw, a
psychological weakness, a mistake, or the necessary consequence of an
inadequate social structure, etc. Only in the knowledge of God's plan
for man can we grasp that sin is an abuse of the freedom that God
gives to created persons so that they are capable of loving him and
loving one another.
Original sin - an essential truth of the faith
388 With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also
illuminated. Although to some extent the People of God in the Old
Testament had tried to understand the pathos of the human condition
in the light of the history of the fall narrated in Genesis, they could not
grasp this story's ultimate meaning, which is revealed only in the light
of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.261 We must know
Christ as the source of grace in order to know Adam as the source of
sin. the Spirit-Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ, came to "convict the
world concerning sin",262 by revealing him who is its Redeemer.
389 The doctrine of original sin is, so to speak, the "reverse side" of the
Good News that Jesus is the Saviour of all men, that all need salvation
and that salvation is offered to all through Christ. the Church, which
has the mind of Christ,263 knows very well that we cannot tamper
with the revelation of original sin without undermining the mystery of
Christ.
How to read the account of the fall
390 The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but
affirms a primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the
history of man.264 Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the
whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely
committed by our first parents.265
II. THE FALL OF THE ANGELS
391 Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive
voice, opposed to God, which makes them fall into death out of
envy.266 Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this being a fallen
angel, called "Satan" or the "devil".267 The Church teaches that Satan
was at first a good angel, made by God: "The devil and the other
demons were indeed created naturally good by God, but they became
evil by their own doing."268
392 Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.269 This "fall" consists in
the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and irrevocably
rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of that rebellion in the
tempter's words to our first parents: "You will be like God."270 The
devil "has sinned from the beginning"; he is "a liar and the father of
lies".271
393 It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in
the infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgivable.
"There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as there is no
repentance for men after death."272
394 Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus
calls "a murderer from the beginning", who would even try to divert
Jesus from the mission received from his Father.273 "The reason the
Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."274 In its
consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction
that led man to disobey God.
395 The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a
creature, powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a
creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God's reign. Although
Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in
Christ Jesus, and although his action may cause grave injuries - of a
spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a physical nature - to each man
and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which with
strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a great
mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but "we
know that in everything God works for good with those who love
him."275
III. ORIGINAL SIN
Freedom put to the test
396 God created man in his image and established him in his
friendship. A spiritual creature, man can live this friendship only in free
submission to God. the prohibition against eating "of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil" spells this out: "for in the day that you eat
of it, you shall die."276 The "tree of the knowledge of good and
evil"277 symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man, being
a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is
dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to
the moral norms that govern the use of freedom.
Man's first sin
397 Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his
heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command. This is
what man's first sin consisted of.278 All subsequent sin would be
disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness.
398 In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very act
scorned him. He chose himself over and against God, against the
requirements of his creaturely status and therefore against his own
good. Constituted in a state of holiness, man was destined to be fully
"divinized" by God in glory. Seduced by the devil, he wanted to "be
like God", but "without God, before God, and not in accordance with
God".279
399 Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first
disobedience. Adam and Eve immediately lose the grace of original
holiness.280 They become afraid of the God of whom they have
conceived a distorted image - that of a God jealous of his
prerogatives.281
400 The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks to
original justice, is now destroyed: the control of the soul's spiritual
faculties over the body is shattered; the union of man and woman
becomes subject to tensions, their relations henceforth marked by lust
and domination.282 Harmony with creation is broken: visible creation
has become alien and hostile to man.283 Because of man, creation is
now subject "to its bondage to decay".284 Finally, the consequence
explicitly foretold for this disobedience will come true: man will
"return to the ground",285 for out of it he was taken. Death makes its
entrance into human history.286
401 After that first sin, the world is virtually inundated by sin There is
Cain's murder of his brother Abel and the universal corruption which
follows in the wake of sin. Likewise, sin frequently manifests itself in
the history of Israel, especially as infidelity to the God of the Covenant
and as transgression of the Law of Moses. and even after Christ's
atonement, sin raises its head in countless ways among Christians.287
Scripture and the Church's Tradition continually recall the presence
and universality of sin in man's history:
What Revelation makes known to us is confirmed by our own
experience. For when man looks into his own heart he finds that he is
drawn towards what is wrong and sunk in many evils which cannot
come from his good creator. Often refusing to acknowledge God as his
source, man has also upset the relationship which should link him to
his last end, and at the same time he has broken the right order that
should reign within himself as well as between himself and other men
and all creatures.288
The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity
402 All men are implicated in Adam's sin, as St. Paul affirms: "By one
man's disobedience many (that is, all men) were made sinners": "sin
came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so
death spread to all men because all men sinned."289 The Apostle
contrasts the universality of sin and death with the universality of
salvation in Christ. "Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation
for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life
for all men."290
403 Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the
overwhelming misery which oppresses men and their inclination
towards evil and death cannot be understood apart from their
connection with Adam's sin and the fact that he has transmitted to us a
sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is the "death of the
soul".291 Because of this certainty of faith, the Church baptizes for the
remission of sins even tiny infants who have not committed personal
sin.292
404 How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants?
the whole human race is in Adam "as one body of one man".293 By
this "unity of the human race" all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as
all are implicated in Christ's justice. Still, the transmission of original
sin is a mystery that we cannot fully understand. But we do know by
Revelation that Adam had received original holiness and justice not for
himself alone, but for all human nature. By yielding to the tempter,
Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the
human nature that they would then transmit in a fallen state.294 It is a
sin which will be transmitted by propagation to all mankind, that is, by
the transmission of a human nature deprived of original holiness and
justice. and that is why original sin is called "sin" only in an analogical
sense: it is a sin "contracted" and not "committed" - a state and not an
act.
405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not
have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It
is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has
not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper
to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and
inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence".
Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and
turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature,
weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to
spiritual battle.
406 The Church's teaching on the transmission of original sin was
articulated more precisely in the fifth century, especially under the
impulse of St. Augustine's reflections against Pelagianism, and in the
sixteenth century, in opposition to the Protestant Reformation.
Pelagius held that man could, by the natural power of free will and
without the necessary help of God's grace, lead a morally good life; he
thus reduced the influence of Adam's fault to bad example. the first
Protestant reformers, on the contrary, taught that original sin has
radically perverted man and destroyed his freedom; they identified the
sin inherited by each man with the tendency to evil (concupiscentia),
which would be insurmountable. the Church pronounced on the
meaning of the data of Revelation on original sin especially at the
second Council of Orange (529)296 and at the Council of Trent
(1546).297
A hard battle. . .
407 The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of
redemption by Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation
and activity in the world. By our first parents' sin, the devil has
acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains
free. Original sin entails "captivity under the power of him who
thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the devil".298 Ignorance of
the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to
serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action299 and
morals.
408 The consequences of original sin and of all men's personal sins put
the world as a whole in the sinful condition aptly described in St.
John's expression, "the sin of the world".300 This expression can also
refer to the negative influence exerted on people by communal
situations and social structures that are the fruit of men's sins.301
409 This dramatic situation of "the whole world [which] is in the
power of the evil one"302 makes man's life a battle:
The whole of man's history has been the story of dour combat with the
powers of evil, stretching, so our Lord tells us, from the very dawn of
history until the last day. Finding himself in the midst of the battlefield
man has to struggle to do what is right, and it is at great cost to
himself, and aided by God's grace, that he succeeds in achieving his
own inner integrity.303
IV. "YOU DID NOT ABANDON HIM TO THE POWER OF
DEATH"
410 After his fall, man was not abandoned by God. On the contrary,
God calls him and in a mysterious way heralds the coming victory over
evil and his restoration from his fall.304 This passage in Genesis is
called the Protoevangelium ("first gospel"): the first announcement of
the Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle between the serpent and the
Woman, and of the final victory of a descendant of hers.
411 The Christian tradition sees in this passage an announcement of
the "New Adam" who, because he "became obedient unto death, even
death on a cross", makes amends superabundantly for the
disobedience, of Adam.305 Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of
the Church have seen the woman announced in the "Proto-
evangelium" as Mary, the mother of Christ, the "new Eve". Mary
benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ's victory over sin: she
was preserved from all stain of original sin and by a special grace of
God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly life.306
412 But why did God not prevent the first man from sinning? St. Leo
the Great responds, "Christ's inexpressible grace gave us blessings
better than those the demon's envy had taken away."307 and St.
Thomas Aquinas wrote, "There is nothing to prevent human nature's
being raised up to something greater, even after sin; God permits evil
in order to draw forth some greater good. Thus St. Paul says, 'Where
sin increased, grace abounded all the more'; and the Exsultet sings, 'O
happy fault,. . . which gained for us so great a Redeemer!'"308
IN BRIEF
413 "God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of
the living. . . It was through the devil's envy that death entered the
world" (Wis 1:13; 2:24).
414 Satan or the devil and the other demons are fallen angels who
have freely refused to serve God and his plan. Their choice against God
is definitive. They try to associate man in their revolt against God.
415 "Although set by God in a state of rectitude man, enticed by the
evil one, abused his freedom at the very start of history. He lifted
himself up against God, and sought to attain his goal apart from him"
(GS 13 # 1).
416 By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and
justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all
human beings.
417 Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature
wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness
and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin".
418 As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers,
subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and
inclined to sin (this inclination is called "concupiscence").
419 "We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent, that original sin is
transmitted with human nature, "by propagation, not by imitation" and
that it is. . . 'proper to each'" (Paul VI, CPG # 16).
420 The victory that Christ won over sin has given us greater blessings
than those which sin had taken from us: "where sin increased, grace
abounded all the more" (Rom 5:20).
421 Christians believe that "the world has been established and kept in
being by the Creator's love; has fallen into slavery to sin but has been
set free by Christ, crucified and risen to break the power of the evil
one. . ." (GS 2 # 2).

CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON
OF GOD
The Good News: God has sent his Son
422 'But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born
of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the
law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.'1 This is 'the gospel of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God':2 God has visited his people. He has
fulfilled the promise he made to Abraham and his descendants. He
acted far beyond all expectation - he has sent his own 'beloved Son'.3
423 We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a
daughter of Israel at Bethlehem at the time of King Herod the Great
and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who died
crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the
reign of the emperor Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He
'came from God',4 'descended from heaven',5 and 'came in the flesh'.6
For 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and
truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the
Father. . . and from his fullness have we all received, grace upon
grace.'7
424 Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father,
we believe in Jesus and confess: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the
living God.'8 On the rock of this faith confessed by St. Peter, Christ
built his Church.9
"To preach. . . the unsearchable riches of Christ"10
425 The transmission of the Christian faith consists primarily in
proclaiming Jesus Christ in order to lead others to faith in him. From
the beginning, the first disciples burned with the desire to proclaim
Christ: "We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."11 It
and they invite people of every era to enter into the joy of their
communion with Christ:
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with
our hands, concerning the word of life - the life was made manifest,
and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life
which was with the Father and was made manifest to us - that which
we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may have
fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his
Son Jesus Christ. and we are writing this that our joy may be
complete.12
At the heart of catechesis: Christ
426 "At the heart of catechesis we find, in essence, a Person, the
Person of Jesus of Nazareth, the only Son from the Father. . .who
suffered and died for us and who now, after rising, is living with us
forever."13 To catechize is "to reveal in the Person of Christ the whole
of God's eternal design reaching fulfilment in that Person. It is to seek
to understand the meaning of Christ's actions and words and of the
signs worked by him."14 Catechesis aims at putting "people . . . in
communion . . . with Jesus Christ: only he can lead us to the love of the
Father in the Spirit and make us share in the life of the Holy
Trinity."15
427 In catechesis "Christ, the Incarnate Word and Son of God,. . . is
taught - everything else is taught with reference to him - and it is
Christ alone who teaches - anyone else teaches to the extent that he is
Christ's spokesman, enabling Christ to teach with his lips. . . Every
catechist should be able to apply to himself the mysterious words of
Jesus: 'My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.'"16
428 Whoever is called "to teach Christ" must first seek "the surpassing
worth of knowing Christ Jesus"; he must suffer "the loss of all things. .
." in order to "gain Christ and be found in him", and "to know him and
the power of his resurrection, and (to) share his sufferings, becoming
like him in his death, that if possible (he) may attain the resurrection
from the dead".17
429 From this loving knowledge of Christ springs the desire to
proclaim him, to "evangelize", and to lead others to the "yes" of faith in
Jesus Christ. But at the same time the need to know this faith better
makes itself felt. To this end, following the order of the Creed, Jesus'
principal titles - "Christ", "Son of God", and "Lord" (article 2) - will be
presented. the Creed next confesses the chief mysteries of his life -
those of his Incarnation (article 3), Paschal mystery (articles 4 and 5)
and glorification (articles 6 and 7).

ARTICLE 2 "AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY SON, OUR
LORD"
I. Jesus
430 Jesus means in Hebrew: "God saves." At the annunciation, the
angel Gabriel gave him the name Jesus as his proper name, which
expresses both his identity and his mission.18 Since God alone can
forgive sins, it is God who, in Jesus his eternal Son made man, "will
save his people from their sins".19 in Jesus, God recapitulates all of his
history of salvation on behalf of men.
431 In the history of salvation God was not content to deliver Israel
"out of the house of bondage"20 by bringing them out of Egypt. He
also saves them from their sin. Because sin is always an offence against
God, only he can forgive it.21 For this reason Israel, becoming more
and more aware of the universality of sin, will no longer be able to seek
salvation except by invoking the name of the Redeemer God.22
432 The name "Jesus" signifies that the very name of God is present in
the person of his Son, made man for the universal and definitive
redemption from sins. It is the divine name that alone brings salvation,
and henceforth all can invoke his name, for Jesus united himself to all
men through his Incarnation,23 so that "there is no other name under
heaven given among men by which we must be saved."24
433 The name of the Saviour God was invoked only once in the year
by the high priest in atonement for the sins of Israel, after he had
sprinkled the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies with the sacrificial
blood. the mercy seat was the place of God's presence.25 When St.
Paul speaks of Jesus whom "God put forward as an expiation by his
blood", he means that in Christ's humanity "God was in Christ
reconciling the world to himself."26
434 Jesus' Resurrection glorifies the name of the Saviour God, for from
that time on it is the name of Jesus that fully manifests the supreme
power of the "name which is above every name".27 The evil spirits fear
his name; in his name his disciples perform miracles, for the Father
grants all they ask in this name.28
435 The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical
prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord Jesus Christ". the
Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words "blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus." the Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer,
says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc, have died with the one word
"Jesus" on their lips.

II. Christ
436 The word "Christ" comes from the Greek translation of the
Hebrew Messiah, which means "anointed". It became the name proper
to Jesus only because he accomplished perfectly the divine mission that
"Christ" signifies. In effect, in Israel those consecrated to God for a
mission that he gave were anointed in his name. This was the case for
kings, for priests and, in rare instances, for prophets.29 This had to be
the case all the more so for the Messiah whom God would send to
inaugurate his kingdom definitively.30 It was necessary that the
Messiah be anointed by the Spirit of the Lord at once as king and
priest, and also as prophet.31 Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of
Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet and king.
437 To the shepherds, the angel announced the birth of Jesus as the
Messiah promised to Israel: "To you is born this day in the city of
David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord."32 From the beginning he
was "the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world",
conceived as "holy" in Mary's virginal womb.33 God called Joseph to
"take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Spirit", so that Jesus, "who is called Christ", should be born of
Joseph's spouse into the messianic lineage of David.34
438 Jesus' messianic consecration reveals his divine mission, "for the
name 'Christ' implies 'he who anointed', 'he who was anointed' and 'the
very anointing with which he was anointed'. the one who anointed is
the Father, the one who was anointed is the Son, and he was anointed
with the Spirit who is the anointing.'"35 His eternal messianic
consecration was revealed during the time of his earthly life at the
moment of his baptism by John, when "God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power", "that he might be
revealed to Israel"36 as its Messiah. His works and words will manifest
him as "the Holy One of God".37
439 Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope
recognized in Jesus the fundamental attributes of the messianic "Son of
David", promised by God to Israel.38 Jesus accepted his rightful title
of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by
some of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially
political.39
440 Jesus accepted Peter's profession of faith, which acknowledged him
to be the Messiah, by announcing the imminent Passion of the Son of
Man.40 He unveiled the authentic content of his messianic kingship
both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man "who came down
from heaven", and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant:
"The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many."41 Hence the true meaning of his kingship
is revealed only when he is raised high on the cross.42 Only after his
Resurrection will Peter be able to proclaim Jesus' messianic kingship to
the People of God: "Let all the house of Israel therefore know
assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus
whom you crucified."43

III. The Only Son of God
441 In the Old Testament, "son of God" is a title given to the angels,
the Chosen People, the children of Israel, and their kings.44 It signifies
an adoptive sonship that establishes a relationship of particular
intimacy between God and his creature. When the promised Messiah-
King is called "son of God", it does not necessarily imply that he was
more than human, according to the literal meaning of these texts.
Those who called Jesus "son of God", as the Messiah of Israel, perhaps
meant nothing more than this.45
442 Such is not the case for Simon Peter when he confesses Jesus as
"the Christ, the Son of the living God", for Jesus responds solemnly:
"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in
heaven."46 Similarly Paul will write, regarding his conversion on the
road to Damascus, "When he who had set me apart before I was born,
and had called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to
me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles..."47 "and in
the synagogues immediately [Paul] proclaimed Jesus, saying, 'He is the
Son of God.'"48 From the beginning this acknowledgment of Christ's
divine sonship will be the centre of the apostolic faith, first professed
by Peter as the Church's foundation.49
443 Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Messiah's
divine sonship because Jesus had clearly allowed it to be so
understood. To his accusers' question before the Sanhedrin, "Are you
the Son of God, then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am."50 Well
before this, Jesus referred to himself as "the Son" who knows the
Father, as distinct from the "servants" God had earlier sent to his
people; he is superior even to the angels.51 He distinguished his
sonship from that of his disciples by never saying "our Father", except
to command them: "You, then, pray like this: 'Our Father'", and he
emphasized this distinction, saying "my Father and your Father".52
444 The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and
the Transfiguration of Christ, the voice of the Father designates Jesus
his "beloved Son".53 Jesus calls himself the "only Son of God", and by
this title affirms his eternal pre-existence.54 He asks for faith in "the
name of the only Son of God".55 In the centurion's exclamation before
the crucified Christ, "Truly this man was the Son of God",56 that
Christian confession is already heard. Only in the Paschal mystery can
the believer give the title "Son of God" its full meaning.
445 After his Resurrection, Jesus' divine sonship becomes manifest in
the power of his glorified humanity. He was "designated Son of God in
power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the
dead".57 The apostles can confess: "We have beheld his glory, glory as
of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."58

IV. Lord
446 In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the ineffable
Hebrew name YHWH, by which God revealed himself to Moses,59 is
rendered as Kyrios, "Lord". From then on, "Lord" becomes the more
usual name by which to indicate the divinity of Israel's God. the New
Testament uses this full sense of the title "Lord" both for the Father
and - what is new - for Jesus, who is thereby recognized as God
Himself.60
447 Jesus ascribes this title to himself in a veiled way when he disputes
with the Pharisees about the meaning of Psalm 110, but also in an
explicit way when he addresses his apostles.61 Throughout his public
life, he demonstrated his divine sovereignty by works of power over
nature, illnesses, demons, death and sin.
448 Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as "Lord". This title
testifies to the respect and trust of those who approach him for help
and healing.62 At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, "Lord" expresses
the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.63 In the encounter with
the risen Jesus, this title becomes adoration: "My Lord and my God!"
It thus takes on a connotation of love and affection that remains proper
to the Christian tradition: "It is the Lord!"64
449 By attributing to Jesus the divine title "Lord", the first confessions
of the Church's faith affirm from the beginning that the power, honour
and glory due to God the Father are due also to Jesus, because "he was
in the form of God",65 and the Father manifested the sovereignty of
Jesus by raising him from the dead and exalting him into his glory.66
450 From the beginning of Christian history, the assertion of Christ's
lordship over the world and over history has implicitly recognized that
man should not submit his personal freedom in an absolute manner to
any earthly power, but only to God the Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ: Caesar is not "the Lord".67 "The Church. . . believes that the
key, the centre and the purpose of the whole of man's history is to be
found in its Lord and Master."68
451 Christian prayer is characterized by the title "Lord", whether in
the invitation to prayer ("The Lord be with you"), its conclusion
("through Christ our Lord") or the exclamation full of trust and hope:
Maranatha ("Our Lord, come!") or Maranatha ("Come, Lord!") -
"Amen Come Lord Jesus!"69

IN BRIEF
452 The name Jesus means "God saves". the child born of the Virgin
Mary is called Jesus, "for he will save his people from their sins" (Mt
1:21): "there is no other name under heaven given among men by
which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).
453 The title "Christ" means "Anointed One" (Messiah).Jesus is the
Christ, for "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power" (Acts 10:38). He was the one "who is to come" (Lk 7:19),
the object of "the hope of Israel" (Acts 28:20).
454 The title "Son of God" signifies the unique and eternal
relationship of Jesus Christ to God his Father: he is the only Son of the
Father (cf Jn 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18); he is God himself (cf Jn 1:1). To be a
Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (cf Acts
8:37; 1 Jn 2:23).
455 The title "Lord" indicates divine sovereignty. To confess or invoke
Jesus as Lord is to believe in his divinity. "No one can say 'Jesus is
Lord' except by the Holy Spirit'" (I Cor 12:3).

Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY"
Paragraph 1. THE SON OF GOD BECAME MAN
I. WHY DID THE WORD BECOME FLESH?
456 With the Nicene Creed, we answer by confessing: "For us men and
for our salvation he came down from heaven; by the power of the Holy
Spirit, he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and was made man."
457 The Word became flesh for us in order to save us by reconciling us
with God, who "loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our
sins": "the Father has sent his Son as the Saviour of the world", and "he
was revealed to take away sins":70
Sick, our nature demanded to be healed; fallen, to be raised up; dead,
to rise again. We had lost the possession of the good; it was necessary
for it to be given back to us. Closed in the darkness, it was necessary to
bring us the light; captives, we awaited a Saviour; prisoners, help;
slaves, a liberator. Are these things minor or insignificant? Did they not
move God to descend to human nature and visit it, since humanity was
in so miserable and unhappy a state?71
458 The Word became flesh so that thus we might know God's love: "In
this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his
only Son into the world, so that we might live through him."72 "For
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever
believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."73
459 The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: "Take my
yoke upon you, and learn from me." "I am the way, and the truth, and
the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me."74 On the mountain
of the Transfiguration, the Father commands: "Listen to him!"75 Jesus
is the model for the Beatitudes and the norm of the new law: "Love
one another as I have loved you."76 This love implies an effective
offering of oneself, after his example.77
460 The Word became flesh to make us "partakers of the divine
nature":78 "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God
became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion
with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son
of God."79 "For the Son of God became man so that we might
become God."80 "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us
sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man,
might make men gods."81
II. THE INCARNATION
461 Taking up St. John's expression, "The Word became flesh",82 The
Church calls "Incarnation" the fact that the Son of God assumed a
human nature in order to accomplish our salvation in it. In a hymn
cited by St. Paul, the Church sings the mystery of the Incarnation:
Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who,
though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a
thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
being born in the likeness of men. and being found in human form he
humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a
cross.83
462 The Letter to the Hebrews refers to the same mystery:
Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices
and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for
me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.
Then I said, Lo, I have come to do your will, O God."84
463 Belief in the true Incarnation of the Son of God is the distinctive
sign of Christian faith: "By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit
which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God."85
Such is the joyous conviction of the Church from her beginning
whenever she sings "the mystery of our religion": "He was manifested
in the flesh."86
III. TRUE GOD AND TRUE MAN
464 The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the
Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God and part man,
nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused mixture of the
divine and the human. He became truly man while remaining truly
God. Jesus Christ is true God and true man.
During the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this
truth of faith against the heresies that falsified it.
465 The first heresies denied not so much Christ's divinity as his true
humanity (Gnostic Docetism). From apostolic times the Christian
faith has insisted on the true incarnation of God's Son "come in the
flesh".87 But already in the third century, the Church in a council at
Antioch had to affirm against Paul of Samosata that Jesus Christ is Son
of God by nature and not by adoption. the first ecumenical council of
Nicaea in 325 confessed in its Creed that the Son of God is "begotten,
not made, of the same substance (homoousios) as the Father", and
condemned Arius, who had affirmed that the Son of God "came to be
from things that were not" and that he was "from another substance"
than that of the Father.88
466 The Nestorian heresy regarded Christ as a human person joined to
the divine person of God's Son. Opposing this heresy, St. Cyril of
Alexandria and the third ecumenical council, at Ephesus in 431,
confessed "that the Word, uniting to himself in his person the flesh
animated by a rational soul, became man."89 Christ's humanity has no
other subject than the divine person of the Son of God, who assumed
it and made it his own, from his conception. For this reason the
Council of Ephesus proclaimed in 431 that Mary truly became the
Mother of God by the human conception of the Son of God in her
womb: "Mother of God, not that the nature of the Word or his divinity
received the beginning of its existence from the holy Virgin, but that,
since the holy body, animated by a rational soul, which the Word of
God united to himself according to the hypostasis, was born from her,
the Word is said to be born according to the flesh."90
467 The Monophysites affirmed that the human nature had ceased to
exist as such in Christ when the divine person of God's Son assumed
it. Faced with this heresy, the fourth ecumenical council, at Chalcedon
in 451, confessed:
Following the holy Fathers, we unanimously teach and confess one and
the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same perfect in divinity and
perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly man, composed of
rational soul and body; consubstantial with the Father as to his divinity
and consubstantial with us as to his humanity; "like us in all things but
sin". He was begotten from the Father before all ages as to his divinity
and in these last days, for us and for our salvation, was born as to his
humanity of the virgin Mary, the Mother of God.91


We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-begotten
Son, is to be acknowledged in two natures without confusion, change,
division or separation. the distinction between the natures was never
abolished by their union, but rather the character proper to each of the
two natures was preserved as they came together in one person
(prosopon) and one hypostasis.92
468 After the Council of Chalcedon, some made of Christ's human
nature a kind of personal subject. Against them, the fifth ecumenical
council, at Constantinople in 553, confessed that "there is but one
hypostasis [or person], which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the
Trinity."93 Thus everything in Christ's human nature is to be
attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not only his
miracles but also his sufferings and even his death: "He who was
crucified in the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ, is true God, Lord of glory,
and one of the Holy Trinity."94
469 The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true God and
true man. He is truly the Son of God who, without ceasing to be God
and Lord, became a man and our brother: "What he was, he remained
and what he was not, he assumed", sings the Roman Liturgy.95 and
the liturgy of St. John Chrysostom proclaims and sings: "O only-
begotten Son and Word of God, immortal being, you who deigned for
our salvation to become incarnate of the holy Mother of God and ever-
virgin Mary, you who without change became man and were crucified,
O Christ our God, you who by your death have crushed death, you
who are one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, save us!"96
IV. HOW IS THE SON OF GOD MAN?
470 Because "human nature was assumed, not absorbed",97 in the
mysterious union of the Incarnation, the Church was led over the
course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ's human soul,
with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human body. In
parallel fashion, she had to recall on each occasion that Christ's human
nature belongs, as his own, to the divine person of the Son of God,
who assumed it. Everything that Christ is and does in this nature
derives from "one of the Trinity".
The Son of God therefore communicates to his humanity his own
personal mode of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body,
Christ thus expresses humanly the divine ways of the Trinity:98
The Son of God. . . worked with human hands; he thought with a
human mind. He acted with a human will, and with a human heart he
loved. Born of the Virgin Mary, he has truly been made one of us, like
to us in all things except sin.99
Christ's soul and his human knowledge
471 Apollinarius of Laodicaea asserted that in Christ the divine Word
had replaced the soul or spirit. Against this error the Church confessed
that the eternal Son also assumed a rational, human soul.100
472 This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a
true human knowledge. As such, this knowledge could not in itself be
unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of his existence
in space and time. This is why the Son of God could, when he became
man, "increase in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and
man",101 and would even have to inquire for himself about what one
in the human condition can learn only from experience.102 This
corresponded to the reality of his voluntary emptying of himself, taking
"the form of a slave".103
473 But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God's Son
expressed the divine life of his person.104 "The human nature of
God's Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and
showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God."105 Such is first
of all the case with the intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son
of God made man has of his Father.106 The Son in his human
knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the secret
thoughts of human hearts.107
474 By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word
incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his human knowledge the fullness of
understanding of the eternal plans he had come to reveal.108 What he
admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere declared himself not
sent to reveal.109
Christ's human will
475 Similarly, at the sixth ecumenical council, Constantinople III in
681, the Church confessed that Christ possesses two wills and two
natural operations, divine and human. They are not opposed to each
other, but co-operate in such a way that the Word made flesh willed
humanly in obedience to his Father all that he had decided divinely
with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation.110 Christ's
human will "does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine
and almighty will."111
Christ's true body
476 Since the Word became flesh in assuming a true humanity, Christ's
body was finite.112 Therefore the human face of Jesus can be
portrayed; at the seventh ecumenical council (Nicaea II in 787) the
Church recognized its representation in holy images to be
legitimate.113
477 At the same time the Church has always acknowledged that in the
body of Jesus "we see our God made visible and so are caught up in
love of the God we cannot see."114 The individual characteristics of
Christ's body express the divine person of God's Son. He has made the
features of his human body his own, to the point that they can be
venerated when portrayed in a holy image, for the believer "who
venerates the icon is venerating in it the person of the one
depicted".115
The heart of the Incarnate Word
478 Jesus knew and loved us each and all during his life, his agony and
his Passion, and gave himself up for each one of us: "The Son of God. .
. loved me and gave himself for me."116 He has loved us all with a
human heart. For this reason, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, pierced by
our sins and for our salvation,117 "is quite rightly considered the chief
sign and symbol of that. . . love with which the divine Redeemer
continually loves the eternal Father and all human beings" without
exception.118
IN BRIEF
479 At the time appointed by God, the only Son of the Father, the
eternal Word, that is, the Word and substantial Image of the Father,
became incarnate; without losing his divine nature he has assumed
human nature.
480 Jesus Christ is true God and true man, in the unity of his divine
person; for this reason he is the one and only mediator between God
and men.
481 Jesus Christ possesses two natures, one divine and the other
human, not confused, but united in the one person of God's Son.
482 Christ, being true God and true man, has a human intellect and
will, perfectly attuned and subject to his divine intellect and divine will,
which he has in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
483 The Incarnation is therefore the mystery of the wonderful union of
the divine and human natures in the one person of the Word.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER TWO I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON
OF GOD
Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY"




Paragraph 2. "CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT AND BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY"
I. CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. . .
484 The Annunciation to Mary inaugurates "the fullness of time",119
The time of the fulfilment of God's promises and preparations. Mary
was invited to conceive him in whom the "whole fullness of deity"
would dwell "bodily".120 The divine response to her question, "How
can this be, since I know not man?", was given by the power of the
Spirit: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you."121
485 The mission of the Holy Spirit is always conjoined and ordered to
that of the Son.122 The Holy Spirit, "the Lord, the giver of Life", is
sent to sanctify the womb of the Virgin Mary and divinely fecundate it,
causing her to conceive the eternal Son of the Father in a humanity
drawn from her own.
486 The Father's only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the
Virgin Mary, is "Christ", that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit,
from the beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation
of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the
magi, to John the Baptist, to the disciples.123 Thus the whole life of
Jesus Christ will make manifest "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Spirit and with power."124
II.... BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY
487 What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it
believes about Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in
turn its faith in Christ.
Mary's predestination
488 "God sent forth his Son", but to prepare a body for him,125 he
wanted the free co-operation of a creature. For this, from all eternity
God chose for the mother of his Son a daughter of Israel, a young
Jewish woman of Nazareth in Galilee, "a virgin betrothed to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name
was Mary":126
The Father of mercies willed that the Incarnation should be preceded
by assent on the part of the predestined mother, so that just as a
woman had a share in the coming of death, so also should a woman
contribute to the coming of life.127
489 Throughout the Old Covenant the mission of many holy women
prepared for that of Mary. At the very beginning there was Eve; despite
her disobedience, she receives the promise of a posterity that will be
victorious over the evil one, as well as the promise that she will be the
mother of all the living.128 By virtue of this promise, Sarah conceives
a son in spite of her old age.129 Against all human expectation God
chooses those who were considered powerless and weak to show forth
his faithfulness to his promises: Hannah, the mother of Samuel;
Deborah; Ruth; Judith and Esther; and many other women.130 Mary
"stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord, who confidently
hope for and receive salvation from him. After a long period of waiting
the times are fulfilled in her, the exalted Daughter of Sion, and the new
plan of salvation is established."131
The Immaculate Conception
490 To become the mother of the Saviour, Mary "was enriched by God
with gifts appropriate to such a role."132 The angel Gabriel at the
moment of the annunciation salutes her as "full of grace".133 In fact,
in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the
announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly
borne by God's grace.
491 Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware
that Mary, "full of grace" through God,134 was redeemed from the
moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1854:
The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her
conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by
virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the human race,
preserved immune from all stain of original sin.135
492 The "splendour of an entirely unique holiness" by which Mary is
"enriched from the first instant of her conception" comes wholly from
Christ: she is "redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the
merits of her Son".136 The Father blessed Mary more than any other
created person "in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places" and chose her "in Christ before the foundation of the world, to
be holy and blameless before him in love".137
493 The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God "the
All-Holy" (Panagia), and celebrate her as "free from any stain of sin, as
though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new
creature".138 By the grace of God Mary remained free of every
personal sin her whole life long.
"Let it be done to me according to your word. . ."
494 At the announcement that she would give birth to "the Son of the
Most High" without knowing man, by the power of the Holy Spirit,
Mary responded with the obedience of faith, certain that "with God
nothing will be impossible": "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord;
let it be [done] to me according to your word."139 Thus, giving her
consent to God's word, Mary becomes the mother of Jesus. Espousing
the divine will for salvation wholeheartedly, without a single sin to
restrain her, she gave herself entirely to the person and to the work of
her Son; she did so in order to serve the mystery of redemption with
him and dependent on him, by God's grace:140
As St. Irenaeus says, "Being obedient she became the cause of salvation
for herself and for the whole human race."141 Hence not a few of the
early Fathers gladly assert. . .: "The knot of Eve's disobedience was
untied by Mary's obedience: what the virgin Eve bound through her
disbelief, Mary loosened by her faith."142 Comparing her with Eve,
they call Mary "the Mother of the living" and frequently claim: "Death
through Eve, life through Mary."143
Mary's divine motherhood
495 Called in the Gospels "the mother of Jesus", Mary is acclaimed by
Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before the birth of
her son, as "the mother of my Lord".144 In fact, the One whom she
conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son
according to the flesh, was none other than the Father's eternal Son,
the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the Church confesses
that Mary is truly "Mother of God" (Theotokos).145
Mary's virginity
496 From the first formulations of her faith, the Church has confessed
that Jesus was conceived solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in the
womb of the Virgin Mary, affirming also the corporeal aspect of this
event: Jesus was conceived "by the Holy Spirit without human
seed".146 The Fathers see in the virginal conception the sign that it
truly was the Son of God who came in a humanity like our own. Thus
St. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginning of the second century says:
You are firmly convinced about our Lord, who is truly of the race of
David according to the flesh, Son of God according to the will and
power of God, truly born of a virgin,. . . he was truly nailed to a tree
for us in his flesh under Pontius Pilate. . . he truly suffered, as he is also
truly risen.147
497 The Gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus
as a divine work that surpasses all human understanding and
possibility:148 "That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit",
said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee.149 The Church sees
here the fulfilment of the divine promise given through the prophet
Isaiah: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son."150
498 People are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark's Gospel
and the New Testament Epistles about Jesus' virginal conception. Some
might wonder if we were merely dealing with legends or theological
constructs not claiming to be history. To this we must respond: Faith in
the virginal conception of Jesus met with the lively opposition,
mockery or incomprehension of non-believers, Jews and pagans
alike;151 so it could hardly have been motivated by pagan mythology
or by some adaptation to the ideas of the age. the meaning of this event
is accessible only to faith, which understands in it the "connection of
these mysteries with one another"152 in the totality of Christ's
mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover. St. Ignatius of Antioch
already bears witness to this connection: "Mary's virginity and giving
birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the notice of the prince of this
world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were
accomplished in God's silence."153
Mary - "ever-virgin"
499 The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church
to confess Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving
birth to the Son of God made man.154 In fact, Christ's birth "did not
diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it."155 and so the
liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the "Ever-
virgin".156
500 Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the
Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus.157 The Church has
always understood these passages as not referring to other children of
the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, "brothers of Jesus", are the
sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew
significantly calls "the other Mary".158 They are close relations of
Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression.159
501 Jesus is Mary's only son, but her spiritual motherhood extends to
all men whom indeed he came to save: "The Son whom she brought
forth is he whom God placed as the first-born among many brethren,
that is, the faithful in whose generation and formation she co-operates
with a mother's love."160
Mary's virginal motherhood in God's plan
502 The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of
Revelation the mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan wanted
his Son to be born of a virgin. These reasons touch both on the person
of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the welcome Mary gave
that mission on behalf of all men.
503 Mary's virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the
Incarnation. Jesus has only God as Father. "He was never estranged
from the Father because of the human nature which he assumed. . . He
is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his
mother as to his humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both
natures."161
504 Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb
because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: "The
first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from
heaven."162 From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the
Holy Spirit, for God "gives him the Spirit without measure."163 From
"his fullness" as the head of redeemed humanity "we have all received,
grace upon grace."164
505 By his virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the
new birth of children adopted in the Holy Spirit through faith. "How
can this be?"165 Participation in the divine life arises "not of blood nor
of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God".166 The
acceptance of this life is virginal because it is entirely the Spirit's gift to
man. the spousal character of the human vocation in relation to
God167 is fulfilled perfectly in Mary's virginal motherhood.
506 Mary is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith
"unadulterated by any doubt", and of her undivided gift of herself to
God's will.168 It is her faith that enables her to become the mother of
the Saviour: "Mary is more blessed because she embraces faith in
Christ than because she conceives the flesh of Christ."169
507 At once virgin and mother, Mary is the symbol and the most
perfect realization of the Church: "the Church indeed. . . by receiving
the word of God in faith becomes herself a mother. By preaching and
Baptism she brings forth sons, who are conceived by the Holy Spirit
and born of God, to a new and immortal life. She herself is a virgin,
who keeps in its entirety and purity the faith she pledged to her
spouse."170
IN BRIEF
508 From among the descendants of Eve, God chose the Virgin Mary
to be the mother of his Son. "Full of grace", Mary is "the most
excellent fruit of redemption" (SC 103): from the first instant of her
conception, she was totally preserved from the stain of original sin and
she remained pure from all personal sin throughout her life.
509 Mary is truly "Mother of God" since she is the mother of the
eternal Son of God made man, who is God himself.
510 Mary "remained a virgin in conceiving her Son, a virgin in giving
birth to him, a virgin in carrying him, a virgin in nursing him at her
breast, always a virgin" (St. Augustine, Serm. 186, 1: PL 38, 999): with
her whole being she is "the handmaid of the Lord" (Lk 1:38).
511 The Virgin Mary "co-operated through free faith and obedience in
human salvation" (LG 56). She uttered her yes "in the name of all
human nature" (St. Thomas Aquinas, S Th III, 30, 1). By her
obedience she became the new Eve, mother of the living.

OF GOD




Article 3 "HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY"




Paragraph 3. THE MYSTERIES OF CHRIST'S LIFE
512 Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries
of the Incarnation (conception and birth) and Paschal mystery
(passion, crucifixion, death, burial, descent into hell, resurrection and
ascension). It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus'
hidden or public life, but the articles of faith concerning his
Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole of his earthly life.
"All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when
he was taken up to heaven",171 is to be seen in the light of the
mysteries of Christmas and Easter.
513 According to circumstances catechesis will make use of all the
richness of the mysteries of Jesus. Here it is enough merely to indicate
some elements common to all the mysteries of Christ's life (I), in order
then to sketch the principal mysteries of Jesus' hidden (II) and public
(III) life.
I. CHRIST'S WHOLE LIFE IS MYSTERY
514 Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not
figure in the Gospels. Almost nothing is said about his hidden life at
Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not recounted.172
What is written in the Gospels was set down there "so that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you
may have life in his name."173
515 The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to
have the faith174 and wanted to share it with others. Having known in
faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see the traces of his
mystery in all his earthly life. From the swaddling clothes of his birth
to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection,
everything in Jesus' life was a sign of his mystery.175 His deeds,
miracles and words all revealed that "in him the whole fullness of deity
dwells bodily."176 His humanity appeared as "sacrament", that is, the
sign and instrument, of his divinity and of the salvation he brings: what
was visible in his earthly life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine
sonship and redemptive mission
Characteristics common to Jesus' mysteries
516 Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and
sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of
the Father. Jesus can say: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father",
and the Father can say: "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to
him!"177 Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father's
will, even the least characteristics of his mysteries manifest "God's love.
. . among us".178
517 Christ's whole life is a mystery of redemption. Redemption comes
to us above all through the blood of his cross,179 but this mystery is at
work throughout Christ's entire life: -already in his Incarnation
through which by becoming poor he enriches us with his poverty;180 -
in his hidden life which by his submission atones for our
disobedience;181 - in his word which purifies its hearers;182- in his
healings and exorcisms by which "he took our infirmities and bore our
diseases";183 - and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us.184
518 Christ's whole life is a mystery of recapitulation. All Jesus did, said
and suffered had for its aim restoring fallen man to his original
vocation:
When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he recapitulated in
himself the long history of mankind and procured for us a "short cut"
to salvation, so that what we had lost in Adam, that is, being in the
image and likeness of God, we might recover in Christ Jesus.185 For
this reason Christ experienced all the stages of life, thereby giving
communion with God to all men.186
Our communion in the mysteries of Jesus
519 All Christ's riches "are for every individual and are everybody's
property."187 Christ did not live his life for himself but for us, from his
Incarnation "for us men and for our salvation" to his death "for our
sins" and Resurrection "for our justification".188 He is still "our
advocate with the Father", who "always lives to make intercession" for
us.189 He remains ever "in the presence of God on our behalf,
bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for us."190
520 In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is "the
perfect man",191 who invites us to become his disciples and follow
him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to imitate,
through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to
accept freely the privation and persecutions that may come our
way.192
521 Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he
lives it in us. "By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain
way united himself with each man."193 We are called only to become
one with him, for he enables us as the members of his Body to share in
what he lived for us in his flesh as our model:
We must continue to accomplish in ourselves the stages of Jesus' life
and his mysteries and often to beg him to perfect and realize them in
us and in his whole Church. . . For it is the plan of the Son of God to
make us and the whole Church partake in his mysteries and to extend
them to and continue them in us and in his whole Church. This is his
plan for fulfilling his mysteries in us.194
II. THE MYSTERIES OF JESUS' INFANCY AND HIDDEN LIFE
The preparations
522 The coming of God's Son to earth is an event of such immensity
that God willed to prepare for it over centuries. He makes everything
converge on Christ: all the rituals and sacrifices, figures and symbols of
the "First Covenant".195 He announces him through the mouths of
the prophets who succeeded one another in Israel. Moreover, he
awakens in the hearts of the pagans a dim expectation of this coming.
523 St. John the Baptist is the Lord's immediate precursor or
forerunner, sent to prepare his way.196 "Prophet of the Most High",
John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last.197 He
inaugurates the Gospel, already from his mother's womb welcomes the
coming of Christ, and rejoices in being "the friend of the bridegroom",
whom he points out as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of
the world".198 Going before Jesus "in the spirit and power of Elijah",
John bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of
conversion, and through his martyrdom.199
524 When the Church celebrates the liturgy of Advent each year, she
makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in
the long preparation for the Saviour's first coming, the faithful renew
their ardent desire for his second coming.200 By celebrating the
precursor's birth and martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his
desire: "He must increase, but I must decrease."201
The Christmas mystery
525 Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.202 Simple
shepherds were the first witnesses to this event. In this poverty heaven's
glory was made manifest.203 The Church never tires of singing the
glory of this night:
The Virgin today brings into the world the Eternal
and the earth offers a cave to the Inaccessible.
The angels and shepherds praise him
and the magi advance with the star,
For you are born for us,
Little Child, God eternal!204
526 To become a child in relation to God is the condition for entering
the kingdom.205 For this, we must humble ourselves and become
little. Even more: to become "children of God" we must be "born from
above" or "born of God".206 Only when Christ is formed in us will the
mystery of Christmas be fulfilled in us.207 Christmas is the mystery of
this "marvellous exchange":
O marvellous exchange! Man's Creator has become man, born of the
Virgin. We have been made sharers in the divinity of Christ who
humbled himself to share our humanity.208
The mysteries of Jesus' infancy
527 Jesus' circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth,209 is the sign
of his incorporation into Abraham's descendants, into the people of the
covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the Law210 and his
deputation to Israel's worship, in which he will participate throughout
his life. This sign prefigures that "circumcision of Christ" which is
Baptism.211
528 The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of Israel,
Son of God and Saviour of the world. the great feast of Epiphany
celebrates the adoration of Jesus by the wise men (magi) from the East,
together with his baptism in the Jordan and the wedding feast at Cana
in Galilee.212 In the magi, representatives of the neighbouring pagan
religions, the Gospel sees the first-fruits of the nations, who welcome
the good news of salvation through the Incarnation. the magi's coming
to Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king of the Jews shows that
they seek in Israel, in the messianic light of the star of David, the one
who will be king of the nations.213 Their coming means that pagans
can discover Jesus and worship him as Son of God and Saviour of the
world only by turning towards the Jews and receiving from them the
messianic promise as contained in the Old Testament.214 The
Epiphany shows that "the full number of the nations" now takes its
"place in the family of the patriarchs", and acquires Israelitica
dignitas215 (is made "worthy of the heritage of Israel").
529 The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the
firstborn Son who belongs to the Lord.216 With Simeon and Anna, all
Israel awaits its encounter with the Saviour - the name given to this
event in the Byzantine tradition. Jesus is recognized as the long-
expected Messiah, the "light to the nations" and the "glory of Israel",
but also "a sign that is spoken against". the sword of sorrow predicted
for Mary announces Christ's perfect and unique oblation on the cross
that will impart the salvation God had "prepared in the presence of all
peoples".
530 The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents217 make
manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: "He came to his own
home, and his own people received him not."218 Christ's whole life
was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him.219
Jesus' departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the
definitive liberator of God's people.220
The mysteries of Jesus' hidden life
531 During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the
vast majority of human beings: a daily life spent without evident
greatness, a life of manual labour. His religious life was that of a Jew
obedient to the law of God,221 a life in the community. From this
whole period it is revealed to us that Jesus was "obedient" to his
parents and that he "increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour
with God and man."222
532 Jesus' obedience to his mother and legal father fulfils the fourth
commandment perfectly and was the temporal image of his filial
obedience to his Father in heaven. the everyday obedience of Jesus to
Joseph and Mary both announced and anticipated the obedience of
Holy Thursday: "Not my will. . ."223 The obedience of Christ in the
daily routine of his hidden life was already inaugurating his work of
restoring what the disobedience of Adam had destroyed.224
533 The hidden life at Nazareth allows everyone to enter into
fellowship with Jesus by the most ordinary events of daily life:
The home of Nazareth is the school where we begin to understand the
life of Jesus - the school of the Gospel. First, then, a lesson of silence.
May esteem for silence, that admirable and indispensable condition of
mind, revive in us. . . A lesson on family life. May Nazareth teach us
what family life is, its communion of love, its austere and simple
beauty, and its sacred and inviolable character... A lesson of work.
Nazareth, home of the "Carpenter's Son", in you I would choose to
understand and proclaim the severe and redeeming law of human
work. . . To conclude, I want to greet all the workers of the world,
holding up to them their great pattern their brother who is God.225
534 The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the
silence of the Gospels about the hidden years of Jesus.226 Here Jesus
lets us catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total consecration to a
mission that flows from his divine sonship: "Did you not know that I
must be about my Father's work?"227 Mary and Joseph did not
understand these words, but they accepted them in faith. Mary "kept
all these things in her heart" during the years Jesus remained hidden in
the silence of an ordinary life.
III. THE MYSTERIES OF JESUS' PUBLIC LIFE
The baptism of Jesus
535 Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan.228
John preaches "a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins".229
A crowd of sinners230 - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and
Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by him. "Then Jesus
appears." the Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism.
Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a
voice from heaven proclaims, "This is my beloved Son."231 This is the
manifestation ("Epiphany") of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of
God.
536 The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and
inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows
himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already "the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world".232 Already he is
anticipating the "baptism" of his bloody death.233 Already he is
coming to "fulfil all righteousness", that is, he is submitting himself
entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this baptism of
death for the remission of our sins.234 The Father's voice responds to
the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son.235 The
Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to
"rest on him".236 Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind.
At his baptism "the heavens were opened"237 - the heavens that
Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent
of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation.
537 Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to
Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection.
the Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement
and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with
him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's
beloved son in the Son and "walk in newness of life":238
Let us be buried with Christ by Baptism to rise with him; let us go
down with him to be raised with him; and let us rise with him to be
glorified with him.239


Everything that happened to Christ lets us know that, after the bath of
water, the Holy Spirit swoops down upon us from high heaven and
that, adopted by the Father's voice, we become sons of God.240
Jesus' temptations
538 The Gospels speak of a time of solitude for Jesus in the desert
immediately after his baptism by John. Driven by the Spirit into the
desert, Jesus remains there for forty days without eating; he lives
among wild beasts, and angels minister to him.241 At the end of this
time Satan tempts him three times, seeking to compromise his filial
attitude toward God. Jesus rebuffs these attacks, which recapitulate the
temptations of Adam in Paradise and of Israel in the desert, and the
devil leaves him "until an opportune time".242
539 The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mysterious
event: Jesus is the new Adam who remained faithful just where the first
Adam had given in to temptation. Jesus fulfils Israel's vocation
perfectly: in contrast to those who had once provoked God during
forty years in the desert, Christ reveals himself as God's Servant, totally
obedient to the divine will. In this, Jesus is the devil's conqueror: he
"binds the strong man" to take back his plunder.243 Jesus' victory over
the tempter in the desert anticipates victory at the Passion, the
supreme act of obedience of his filial love for the Father.
540 Jesus' temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God is
Messiah, contrary to the way Satan proposes to him and the way men
wish to attribute to him.244 This is why Christ vanquished the
Tempter for us: "For we have not a high priest who is unable to
sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has
been tested as we are, yet without sinning."245 By the solemn forty
days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of
Jesus in the desert.
"The kingdom of God is at hand"
541 "Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching
the gospel of God, and saying: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
of God is at hand: repent, and believe in the gospel.'"246 "To carry out
the will of the Father Christ inaugurated the kingdom of heaven on
earth."247 Now the Father's will is "to raise up men to share in his
own divine life".248 He does this by gathering men around his Son
Jesus Christ. This gathering is the Church, "on earth the seed and
beginning of that kingdoms".249
542 Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the "family
of God". By his word, through signs that manifest the reign of God,
and by sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people to come together
around him. But above all in the great Paschal mystery - his death on
the cross and his Resurrection - he would accomplish the coming of his
kingdom. "and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
to myself." Into this union with Christ all men are called.250
The proclamation of the kingdom of God
543 Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced to the
children of Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of
all nations.251 To enter it, one must first accept Jesus' word:
The word of the Lord is compared to a seed which is sown in a field;
those who hear it with faith and are numbered among the little flock of
Christ have truly received the kingdom. Then, by its own power, the
seed sprouts and grows until the harvest.252
544 The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those
who have accepted it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to "preach good
news to the poor";253 he declares them blessed, for "theirs is the
kingdom of heaven."254 To them - the "little ones" the Father is
pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise and the
learned.255 Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle to the
cross; he experiences hunger, thirst and privation.256 Jesus identifies
himself with the poor of every kind and makes active love toward them
the condition for entering his kingdom.257
545 Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: "I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners."258 He invites them to that conversion
without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but shows them in word
and deed his Father's boundless mercy for them and the vast "joy in
heaven over one sinner who repents".259 The supreme proof of his
love will be the sacrifice of his own life "for the forgiveness of sins".260
546 Jesus' invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of
parables, a characteristic feature of his teaching.261 Through his
parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks
for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything.262
Words are not enough, deeds are required.263 The parables are like
mirrors for man: will he be hard soil or good earth for the word?264
What use has he made of the talents he has received?265 Jesus and the
presence of the kingdom in this world are secretly at the heart of the
parables. One must enter the kingdom, that is, become a disciple of
Christ, in order to "know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven".266
For those who stay "outside", everything remains enigmatic.267
The signs of the kingdom of God
547 Jesus accompanies his words with many "mighty works and
wonders and signs", which manifest that the kingdom is present in him
and attest that he was the promised Messiah.268
548 The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent him.
They invite belief in him.269 To those who turn to him in faith, he
grants what they ask.270 So miracles strengthen faith in the One who
does his Father's works; they bear witness that he is the Son of
God.271 But his miracles can also be occasions for "offence";272 they
are not intended to satisfy people's curiosity or desire for magic
Despite his evident miracles some people reject Jesus; he is even
accused of acting by the power of demons.273
549 By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger,
injustice, illness and death,274 Jesus performed messianic signs.
Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below,275 but to
free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their
vocation as God's sons and causes all forms of human bondage.276
550 The coming of God's kingdom means the defeat of Satan's: "If it is
by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God
has come upon you."277 Jesus' exorcisms free some individuals from
the domination of demons. They anticipate Jesus' great victory over
"the ruler of this world".278 The kingdom of God will be definitively
established through Christ's cross: "God reigned from the wood."279
"The keys of the kingdom"
551 From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain men,
twelve in number, to be with him and to participate in his mission.280
He gives the Twelve a share in his authority and 'sent them out to
preach the kingdom of God and to heal."281 They remain associated
for ever with Christ's kingdom, for through them he directs the
Church:
As my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that
you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.282
552 Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve;283
Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a revelation from the
Father, Peter had confessed: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living
God." Our Lord then declared to him: "You are Peter, and on this rock
I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against
it."284 Christ, the "living Stone",285 thus assures his Church, built on
Peter, of victory over the powers of death. Because of the faith he
confessed Peter will remain the unshakeable rock of the Church. His
mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his
brothers in it.286
553 Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: "I will give you the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."287 The "power of the keys" designates authority to govern the
house of God, which is the Church. Jesus, the Good Shepherd,
confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection: "Feed my sheep."288
The power to "bind and loose" connotes the authority to absolve sins,
to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions
in the Church. Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through
the ministry of the apostles289 and in particular through the ministry
of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted the keys of the
kingdom.
A foretaste of the kingdom: the Transfiguration
554 From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
the living God, the Master "began to show his disciples that he must go
to Jerusalem and suffer many things. . . and be killed, and on the third
day be raised."290 Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others
understand it any better than he.291 In this context the mysterious
episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain,292
before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John. Jesus'
face and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah
appear, speaking "of his departure, which he was to accomplish at
Jerusalem".293 A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says:
"This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"294
555 For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter's
confession. He also reveals that he will have to go by the way of the
cross at Jerusalem in order to "enter into his glory".295
Moses and Elijah had seen God's glory on the Mountain; the Law and
the Prophets had announced the Messiah's sufferings.296 Christ's
Passion is the will of the Father: the Son acts as God's servant;297 The
cloud indicates the presence of the Holy Spirit. "The whole Trinity
appeared: the Father in the voice; the Son in the man; the Spirit in the
shining cloud."298
You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples, as much as
they were capable of it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that
when they should see you crucified they would understand that your
Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the
splendour of the Father.299
556 On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the threshold
of the Passover: the Transfiguration. Jesus' baptism proclaimed "the
mystery of the first regeneration", namely, our Baptism; the
Transfiguration "is the sacrament of the second regeneration": our own
Resurrection.300 From now on we share in the Lord's Resurrection
through the Spirit who acts in the sacraments of the Body of Christ.
the Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of Christ's glorious coming,
when he "will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body."301
But it also recalls that "it is through many persecutions that we must
enter the kingdom of God":302
Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain with
Christ on the mountain. It has been reserved for you, Peter, but for
after death. For now, Jesus says: "Go down to toil on earth, to serve on
earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth. Life goes down to be
killed; Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be
exhausted on his journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and
you refuse to suffer?"303
Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem
557 "When the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus] set his
face to go to Jerusalem."304 By this decision he indicated that he was
going up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times he had
announced his Passion and Resurrection; now, heading toward
Jerusalem, Jesus says: "It cannot be that a prophet should perish away
from Jerusalem."305
558 Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to
death in Jerusalem. Nevertheless he persists in calling Jerusalem to
gather around him: "How often would I have gathered your children
together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would
not!"306 When Jerusalem comes into view he weeps over her and
expresses once again his heart's desire: "Would that even today you
knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your
eyes."307
Jesus' messianic entrance into Jerusalem
559 How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Jesus had
always refused popular attempts to make him king, he chooses the time
and prepares the details for his messianic entry into the city of "his
father David".308 Acclaimed as son of David, as the one who brings
salvation (Hosanna means "Save!" or "Give salvation!"), the "King of
glory" enters his City "riding on an ass".309 Jesus conquers the
Daughter of Zion, a figure of his Church, neither by ruse nor by
violence, but by the humility that bears witness to the truth.310 and so
the subjects of his kingdom on that day are children and God's poor,
who acclaim him as had the angels when they announced him to the
shepherds.311 Their acclamation, "Blessed be he who comes in the
name of the Lord",312 is taken up by the Church in the Sanctus of the
Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the memorial of the Lord's Passover.
560 Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom
that the King-Messiah was going to accomplish by the Passover of his
Death and Resurrection. It is with the celebration of that entry on
Palm Sunday that the Church's liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week.
IN BRIEF
561 "The whole of Christ's life was a continual teaching: his silences,
his miracles, his gestures, his prayer, his love for people, his special
affection for the little and the poor, his acceptance of the total sacrifice
on the Cross for the redemption of the world, and his Resurrection are
the actualization of his word and the fulfilment of Revelation" John
Paul II, CT 9).
562 Christ's disciples are to conform themselves to him until he is
formed in them (cf Gal 4:19). "For this reason we, who have been
made like to him, who have died with him and risen with him, are
taken up into the mysteries of his life, until we reign together with him"
(LG 7 # 4).
563 No one, whether shepherd or wise man, can approach God here
below except by kneeling before the manger at Bethlehem and adoring
him hidden in the weakness of a new-born child.
564 By his obedience to Mary and Joseph, as well as by his humble
work during the long years in Nazareth, Jesus gives us the example of
holiness in the daily life of family and work.
565 From the beginning of his public life, at his baptism, Jesus is the
"Servant", wholly consecrated to the redemptive work that he will
accomplish by the "baptism" of his Passion.
566 The temptation in the desert shows Jesus, the humble Messiah,
who triumphs over Satan by his total adherence to the plan of salvation
willed by the Father.
567 The kingdom of heaven was inaugurated on earth by Christ. "This
kingdom shone out before men in the word, in the works and in the
presence of Christ" (LG 5). the Church is the seed and beginning of
this kingdom. Its keys are entrusted to Peter.
568 Christ's Transfiguration aims at strengthening the apostles' faith in
anticipation of his Passion: the ascent on to the "high mountain"
prepares for the ascent to Calvary. Christ, Head of the Church,
manifests what his Body contains and radiates in the sacraments: "the
hope of glory" (Col 1:27; cf.: St. Leo the Great, Sermo 51, 3: PL 54,
310C).
569 Jesus went up to Jerusalem voluntarily, knowing well that there he
would die a violent death because of the opposition of sinners (cf ?
Heb 12:3).
570 Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifests the coming of the kingdom
that the Messiah-King, welcomed into his city by children and the
humble of heart, is going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death
and Resurrection.

"JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE, WAS
CRUCIFIED, DIED AND WAS BURIED"
571 The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection stands at
the centre of the Good News that the apostles, and the Church
following them, are to proclaim to the world. God's saving plan was
accomplished "once for all"313 by the redemptive death of his Son
Jesus Christ.
572 The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all the
Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: "Was it
not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into
his glory?"314 Jesus' sufferings took their historical, concrete form
from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and the chief priests
and the scribes", who handed "him to the Gentiles to be mocked and
scourged and crucified".315
573 Faith can therefore try to examine the circumstances of Jesus'
death, faithfully handed on by the Gospels316 and illuminated by
other historical sources, the better to understand the meaning of the
Redemption.

Paragraph 1. JESUS AND ISRAEL
574 From the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, certain Pharisees
and partisans of Herod together with priests and scribes agreed
together to destroy him.317 Because of certain acts of his expelling
demons, forgiving sins, healing on the sabbath day, his novel
interpretation of the precepts of the Law regarding purity, and his
familiarity with tax collectors and public sinners318--some ill-
intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic possession.319 He is
accused of blasphemy and false prophecy, religious crimes which the
Law punished with death by stoning.320
575 Many of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a "sign of
contradiction",321 but more so for the religious authorities in
Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply "the
Jews",322 than for the ordinary People of God.323 To be sure, Christ's
relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical. Some
Pharisees warn him of the danger he was courting;324 Jesus praises
some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at
their homes.325 Jesus endorses some of the teachings imparted by this
religious elite of God's people: the resurrection of the dead,326 certain
forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting and prayer),327 The custom of
addressing God as Father, and the centrality of the commandment to
love God and neighbour.328
576 In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against
essential institutions of the Chosen People: - submission to the whole
of the Law in its written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in the
interpretation of oral tradition; - the centrality of the Temple at
Jerusalem as the holy place where God's presence dwells in a special
way; - faith in the one God whose glory no man can share.
I. JESUS AND THE LAW
577 At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a
solemn warning in which he presented God's law, given on Sinai
during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant:
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I
have come not to abolish but to fulfil. For truly I tell you, until heaven
and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass
from the law, until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one
of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the
same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does
them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of
heaven.329
578 Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven, was to fulfil the Law by keeping it in its all embracing detail -
according to his own words, down to "the least of these
commandments".330 He is in fact the only one who could keep it
perfectly.331 On their own admission the Jews were never able to
observe the Law in its entirety without violating the least of its
precepts.332 This is why every year on the Day of Atonement the
children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their transgressions of the
Law. the Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, and St. James
recalls, "Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has
become guilty of all of it."333
579 This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter
but in spirit was dear to the Pharisees. By giving Israel this principle
they had led many Jews of Jesus' time to an extreme religious zeal.334
This zeal, were it not to lapse into "hypocritical" casuistry,335 could
only prepare the People for the unprecedented intervention of God
through the perfect fulfilment of the Law by the only Righteous One in
place of all sinners.336
580 The perfect fulfilment of the Law could be the work of none but
the divine legislator, born subject to the Law in the person of the
Son.337 In Jesus, the Law no longer appears engraved on tables of
stone but "upon the heart" of the Servant who becomes "a covenant to
the people", because he will "faithfully bring forth justice".338 Jesus
fulfils the Law to the point of taking upon himself "the curse of the
Law" incurred by those who do not "abide by the things written in the
book of the Law, and do them", for his death took place to redeem
them "from the transgressions under the first covenant".339
581 The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a
rabbi.340 He often argued within the framework of rabbinical
interpretation of the Law.341 Yet Jesus could not help but offend the
teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his
interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people "as one who had
authority, and not as their scribes".342 In Jesus, the same Word of God
that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses,
made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes.343 Jesus did
not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by giving its ultimate interpretation
in a divine way: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old. . .
But I say to you. . ."344 With this same divine authority, he disavowed
certain human traditions of the Pharisees that were "making void the
word of God".345
582 Going even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so important in
Jewish daily life, by revealing its pedagogical meaning through a divine
interpretation: "Whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile
him. . . (Thus he declared all foods clean.). . . What comes out of a
man is what defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart of man,
come evil thoughts. . ."346 In presenting with divine authority the
definitive interpretation of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by
certain teachers of the Law who did not accept his interpretation of the
Law, guaranteed though it was by the divine signs that accompanied
it.347 This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, for he recalls,
often with rabbinical arguments, that the sabbath rest is not violated by
serving God and neighbour,348 which his own healings did.
II. JESUS AND THE TEMPLE
583 Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect
for the Temple in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary
presented him forty days after his birth.349 At the age of twelve he
decided to remain in the Temple to remind his parents that he must be
about his Father's business.350 He went there each year during his
hidden life at least for Passover.351 His public ministry itself was
patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish
feasts.352
584 Jesus went up to the Temple as the privileged place of encounter
with God. For him, the Temple was the dwelling of his Father, a house
of prayer, and he was angered that its outer court had become a place
of commerce.353 He drove merchants out of it because of jealous love
for his Father: "You shall not make my Father's house a house of trade.
His disciples remembered that it was written, 'Zeal for your house will
consume me.'"354 After his Resurrection his apostles retained their
reverence for the Temple.355
585 On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming
destruction of this splendid building, of which there would not remain
"one stone upon another".356 By doing so, he announced a sign of the
last days, which were to begin with his own Passover.357 But this
prophecy would be distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his
interrogation at the high priest's house, and would be thrown back at
him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross.358
586 Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the
essential part of his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the Temple-tax,
associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the foundation of
his future Church.359 He even identified himself with the Temple by
presenting himself as God's definitive dwelling-place among men.360
Therefore his being put to bodily death361 presaged the destruction of
the Temple, which would manifest the dawning of a new age in the
history of salvation: "The hour is coming when neither on this
mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."362
III. JESUS AND ISRAEL'S FAITH IN THE ONE GOD AND
SAVIOUR
587 If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of
opposition to Jesus by Israel's religious authorities, his role in the
redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true
stumbling-block for them.363
588 Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and
sinners as familiarly as with themselves.364 Against those among them
"who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised
others", Jesus affirmed: "I have not come to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance."365 He went further by proclaiming before the
Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who pretend not to need
salvation are blind to themselves.366
589 Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful
conduct toward sinners with God's own attitude toward them.367 He
went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was
admitting them to the messianic banquet.368 But it was most
especially by forgiving sins that Jesus placed the religious authorities of
Israel on the horns of a dilemma. Were they not entitled to demand in
consternation, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"369 By forgiving
sins Jesus either is blaspheming as a man who made himself God's
equal, or is speaking the truth and his person really does make present
and reveal God's name.370
590 Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a
claim as "He who is not with me is against me"; and his saying that
there was in him "something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than
Solomon", something "greater than the Temple"; his reminder that
David had called the Messiah his Lord,371 and his affirmations,
"Before Abraham was, I AM", and even "I and the Father are one."372
591 Jesus asked the religious authorities of Jerusalem to believe in him
because of the Father's works which he accomplished.373 But such an
act of faith must go through a mysterious death to self, for a new "birth
from above" under the influence of divine grace.374 Such a demand
for conversion in the face of so surprising a fulfilment of the
promises375 allows one to understand the Sanhedrin's tragic
misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that he deserved the death
sentence as a blasphemer.376 The members of the Sanhedrin were
thus acting at the same time out of "ignorance" and the "hardness" of
their "unbelief".377
IN BRIEF
592 Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf Mt
5:17-19) with such perfection (cf Jn 8:46) that he revealed its ultimate
meaning (cf Mt 5:33) and redeemed the transgressions against it (cf
Heb 9:15).
593 Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it for the Jewish feasts
of pilgrimage, and with a jealous love he loved this dwelling of God
among men. the Temple prefigures his own mystery. When he
announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution
and of the entry into a new age in the history of salvation, when his
Body would be the definitive Temple.
594 Jesus performed acts, such as pardoning sins, that manifested him
to be the Saviour God himself (cf Jn 5:16-18). Certain Jews, who did
not recognize God made man (cf Jn 1:14), saw in him only a man who
made himself God (Jn 10:33), and judged him as a blasphemer.

Paragraph 2. JESUS DIED CRUCIFIED
I. THE TRIAL OF JESUS
Divisions among the Jewish authorities concerning Jesus
595 Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the
Pharisee Nicodemus and the prominent Joseph of Arimathea both
secret disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing dissension
about him, so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the
very eve of Christ's Passion, "many.. . believed in him", though very
imperfectly.378 This is not surprising, if one recalls that on the day
after Pentecost "a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith"
and "some believers. . . belonged to the party of the Pharisees", to the
point that St. James could tell St. Paul, "How many thousands there
are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous
for the Law."379
596 The religious authorities in Jerusalem were not unanimous about
what stance to take towards Jesus.380 The Pharisees threatened to
excommunicate his followers.381 To those who feared that "everyone
will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our
holy place and our nation", the high priest Caiaphas replied by
prophesying: "It is expedient for you that one man should die for the
people, and that the whole nation should not perish."382 The
Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer
but having lost the right to put anyone to death, hands him over to the
Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the
same category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.383 The
chief priests also threatened Pilate politically so that he would
condemn Jesus to death.384
Jews are not collectively responsible for Jesus' death
597 The historical complexity of Jesus' trial is apparent in the Gospel
accounts. the personal sin of the participants (Judas, the Sanhedrin,
Pilate) is known to God alone. Hence we cannot lay responsibility for
the trial on the Jews in Jerusalem as a whole, despite the outcry of a
manipulated crowd and the global reproaches contained in the
apostles' calls to conversion after Pentecost.385 Jesus himself, in
forgiving them on the cross, and Peter in following suit, both accept
"the ignorance" of the Jews of Jerusalem and even of their leaders.386
Still less can we extend responsibility to other Jews of different times
and places, based merely on the crowd's cry: "His blood be on us and
on our children!", a formula for ratifying a judicial sentence.387 As the
Church declared at the Second Vatican Council: . . .
Neither all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews today, can be
charged with the crimes committed during his Passion. . . the Jews
should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed as if this followed from
holy Scripture.388
All sinners were the authors of Christ's Passion
598 In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her
saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors
and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer
endured."389 Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ
himself,390 The Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the
gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a
responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews
alone:
We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their
sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the
cross, those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify
the Son of God anew in their hearts (for he is in them) and hold him
up to contempt. and it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater
in us than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the
Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess
to know him. and when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way
seem to lay violent hands on him.391


Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified him and
crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.392
II. CHRIST'S REDEMPTIVE DEATH IN GOD'S PLAN OF
SALVATION
"Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God"
599 Jesus' violent death was not the result of chance in an unfortunate
coincidence of circumstances, but is part of the mystery of God's plan,
as St. Peter explains to the Jews of Jerusalem in his first sermon on
Pentecost: "This Jesus (was) delivered up according to the definite plan
and foreknowledge of God."393 This Biblical language does not mean
that those who handed him over were merely passive players in a
scenario written in advance by God.394
600 To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When
therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes
in it each person's free response to his grace: "In this city, in fact, both
Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take
place."395 For the sake of accomplishing his plan of salvation, God
permitted the acts that flowed from their blindness.396
"He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures"
601 The Scriptures had foretold this divine plan of salvation through
the putting to death of "the righteous one, my Servant" as a mystery of
universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that would free men from
the slavery of sin.397 Citing a confession of faith that he himself had
"received", St. Paul professes that "Christ died for our sins in
accordance with the scriptures."398 In particular Jesus' redemptive
death fulfils Isaiah's prophecy of the suffering Servant.399 Indeed
Jesus himself explained the meaning of his life and death in the light of
God's suffering Servant.400 After his Resurrection he gave this
interpretation of the Scriptures to the disciples at Emmaus, and then
to the apostles.401
"For our sake God made him to be sin"
602 Consequently, St. Peter can formulate the apostolic faith in the
divine plan of salvation in this way: "You were ransomed from the futile
ways inherited from your fathers... with the precious blood of Christ,
like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the
foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times
for your sake."402 Man's sins, following on original sin, are punishable
by death.403 By sending his own Son in the form of a slave, in the
form of a fallen humanity, on account of sin, God "made him to be sin
who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of
God."404
603 Jesus did not experience reprobation as if he himself had
sinned.405 But in the redeeming love that always united him to the
Father, he assumed us in the state of our waywardness of sin, to the
point that he could say in our name from the cross: "My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?"406 Having thus established him in
solidarity with us sinners, God "did not spare his own Son but gave
him up for us all", so that we might be "reconciled to God by the death
of his Son".407
God takes the initiative of universal redeeming love
604 By giving up his own Son for our sins, God manifests that his plan
for us is one of benevolent love, prior to any merit on our part: "In this
is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to
be the expiation for our sins."408 God "shows his love for us in that
while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."409
605 At the end of the parable of the lost sheep Jesus recalled that God's
love excludes no one: "So it is not the will of your Father who is in
heaven that one of these little ones should perish."410 He affirms that
he came "to give his life as a ransom for many"; this last term is not
restrictive, but contrasts the whole of humanity with the unique person
of the redeemer who hands himself over to save us.411 The Church,
following the apostles, teaches that Christ died for all men without
exception: "There is not, never has been, and never will be a single
human being for whom Christ did not suffer."412
III. CHRIST OFFERED HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER FOR OUR
SINS
Christ's whole life is an offering to the Father
606 The Son of God, who came down "from heaven, not to do (his)
own will, but the will of him who sent (him)",413 said on coming into
the world, "Lo, I have come to do your will, O God." "and by that will
we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all."414 From the first moment of his Incarnation the
Son embraces the Father's plan of divine salvation in his redemptive
mission: "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
accomplish his work."415 The sacrifice of Jesus "for the sins of the
whole world"416 expresses his loving communion with the Father.
"The Father loves me, because I lay down my life", said the Lord,
"(for) I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may
know that I love the Father."417
607 The desire to embrace his Father's plan of redeeming love inspired
Jesus' whole life,418 for his redemptive passion was the very reason for
his Incarnation. and so he asked, "and what shall I say? 'Father, save
me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour."419
and again, "Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given
me?"420 From the cross, just before "It is finished", he said, "I
thirst."421
"The Lamb who takes away the sin of the world"
608 After agreeing to baptize him along with the sinners, John the
Baptist looked at Jesus and pointed him out as the "Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world".422 By doing so, he reveals that Jesus
is at the same time the suffering Servant who silently allows himself to
be led to the slaughter and who bears the sin of the multitudes, and
also the Paschal Lamb, the symbol of Israel's redemption at the first
Passover.423 Christ's whole life expresses his mission: "to serve, and to
give his life as a ransom for many."424
Jesus freely embraced the Father's redeeming love
609 By embracing in his human heart the Father's love for men, Jesus
"loved them to the end", for "greater love has no man than this, that a
man lay down his life for his friends."425 In suffering and death his
humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love
which desires the salvation of men.426 Indeed, out of love for his
Father and for men, whom the Father wants to save, Jesus freely
accepted his Passion and death: "No one takes [my life] from me, but I
lay it down of my own accord."427 Hence the sovereign freedom of
God's Son as he went out to his death.428
At the Last Supper Jesus anticipated the free offering of his life
610 Jesus gave the supreme expression of his free offering of himself at
the meal shared with the twelve Apostles "on the night he was
betrayed".429 On the eve of his Passion, while still free, Jesus
transformed this Last Supper with the apostles into the memorial of
his voluntary offering to the Father for the salvation of men: "This is
my body which is given for you." "This is my blood of the covenant,
which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."430
611 The Eucharist that Christ institutes at that moment will be the
memorial of his sacrifice.431 Jesus includes the apostles in his own
offering and bids them perpetuate it.432 By doing so, the Lord
institutes his apostles as priests of the New Covenant: "For their sakes
I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth."433
The agony at Gethsemani
612 The cup of the New Covenant, which Jesus anticipated when he
offered himself at the Last Supper, is afterwards accepted by him from
his Father's hands in his agony in the garden at Gethsemani,434
making himself "obedient unto death". Jesus prays: "My Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass from me. . ."435 Thus he expresses the
horror that death represented for his human nature. Like ours, his
human nature is destined for eternal life; but unlike ours, it is perfectly
exempt from sin, the cause of death.436 Above all, his human nature
has been assumed by the divine person of the "Author of life", the
"Living One".437 By accepting in his human will that the Father's will
be done, he accepts his death as redemptive, for "he himself bore our
sins in his body on the tree."438
Christ's death is the unique and definitive sacrifice
613 Christ's death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes the
definitive redemption of men, through "the Lamb of God, who takes
away the sin of the world",439 and the sacrifice of the New Covenant,
which restores man to communion with God by reconciling him to
God through the "blood of the covenant, which was poured out for
many for the forgiveness of sins".440
614 This sacrifice of Christ is unique; it completes and surpasses all
other sacrifices.441 First, it is a gift from God the Father himself, for
the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to reconcile us with
himself. At the same time it is the offering of the Son of God made
man, who in freedom and love offered his life to his Father through the
Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience.442
Jesus substitutes his obedience for our disobedience
615 "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
one man's obedience many will be made righteous."443 By his
obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the
suffering Servant, who "makes himself an offering for sin", when "he
bore the sin of many", and who "shall make many to be accounted
righteous", for "he shall bear their iniquities".444 Jesus atoned for our
faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father.445
Jesus consummates his sacrifice on the cross
616 It is love "to the end"446 that confers on Christ's sacrifice its value
as redemption and reparation, as atonement and satisfaction. He knew
and loved us all when he offered his life.447 Now "the love of Christ
controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all;
therefore all have died."448 No man, not even the holiest, was ever
able to take on himself the sins of all men and offer himself as a
sacrifice for all. the existence in Christ of the divine person of the Son,
who at once surpasses and embraces all human persons, and
constitutes himself as the Head of all mankind, makes possible his
redemptive sacrifice for all.
617 The Council of Trent emphasizes the unique character of Christ's
sacrifice as "the source of eternal salvation"449 and teaches that "his
most holy Passion on the wood of the cross merited justification for
us."450 and the Church venerates his cross as she sings: "Hail, O
Cross, our only hope."451
Our participation in Christ's sacrifice
618 The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the "one mediator
between God and men".452 But because in his incarnate divine person
he has in some way united himself to every man, "the possibility of
being made partners, in a way known to God, in the paschal mystery"
is offered to all men.453 He calls his disciples to "take up [their] cross
and follow (him)",454 for "Christ also suffered for (us), leaving (us) an
example so that (we) should follow in his steps."455 In fact Jesus
desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be
its first beneficiaries.456 This is achieved supremely in the case of his
mother, who was associated more intimately than any other person in
the mystery of his redemptive suffering.457 Apart from the cross there
is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven.458
IN BRIEF
619 "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures" (I Cor
15:3).
620 Our salvation flows from God's initiative of love for us, because
"he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins" (I Jn
4:10). "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor
5:19).
621 Jesus freely offered himself for our salvation. Beforehand, during
the Last Supper, he both symbolized this offering and made it really
present: "This is my body which is given for you" (Lk 22:19).
622 The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he came "to
give his life as a ransom for many" (Mt 20:28), that is, he "loved [his
own] to the end" (Jn 13:1), so that they might be "ransomed from the
futile ways inherited from [their] fathers" (I Pt 1:18).
623 By his loving obedience to the Father, "unto death, even death on
a cross" (Phil 2:8), Jesus fulfils the atoning mission (cf Is 53:10) of the
suffering Servant, who will "make many righteous; and he shall bear
their iniquities" (Is 53:11; cf. Rom 5:19).

Article 4 "JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS
PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED AND WAS BURIED"




Paragraph 3. JESUS CHRIST WAS BURIED
624 "By the grace of God" Jesus tasted death "for every one".459 In his
plan of salvation, God ordained that his Son should not only "die for
our sins"460 but should also "taste death", experience the condition of
death, the separation of his soul from his body, between the time he
expired on the cross and the time he was raised from the dead. the
state of the dead Christ is the mystery of the tomb and the descent into
hell. It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the
tomb,461 reveals God's great sabbath rest462 after the fulfilment463
of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe.464
Christ in the tomb in his body
625 Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his
passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today. the
same person of the "Living One" can say, "I died, and behold I am
alive for evermore":465
God [the Son] did not impede death from separating his soul from his
body according to the necessary order of nature, but has reunited them
to one another in the Resurrection, so that he himself might be, in his
person, the meeting point for death and life, by arresting in himself the
decomposition of nature produced by death and so becoming the
source of reunion for the separated parts.466
626 Since the "Author of life" who was killed467 is the same "living
one [who has] risen",468 The divine person of the Son of God
necessarily continued to possess his human soul and body, separated
from each other by death:
By the fact that at Chnst's death his soul was separated from his flesh,
his one person is not itself divided into two persons; for the human
body and soul of Christ have existed in the same way from the
beginning of his earthly existence, in the divine person of the Word;
and in death, although separated from each other, both remained with
one and the same person of the Word.469
"You will not let your Holy One see corruption"
627 Christ's death was a real death in that it put an end to his earthly
human existence. But because of the union which the person of the
Son retained with his body, his was not a mortal corpse like others, for
"it was not possible for death to hold him".469Bis and therefore
"divine power preserved Christ's body from corruption."470 Both of
these statements can be said of Christ: "He was cut off out of the land
of the living",471 and "My flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not
abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption."472
Jesus' Resurrection "on the third day" was the sign of this, also
because bodily decay was held to begin on the fourth day after
death.473
p class=MsoNormal>"Buried with Christ. . ."
628 Baptism, the original and full sign of which is immersion,
efficaciously signifies the descent into the tomb by the Christian who
dies to sin with Christ in order to live a new life. "We were buried
therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised
from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness
of life."474
IN BRIEF
629 To the benefit of every man, Jesus Christ tasted death (cf Heb
2:9). It is truly the Son of God made man who died and was buried.
630 During Christ's period in the tomb, his divine person continued to
assume both his soul and his body, although they were separated from
each other by death. For this reason the dead Christ's body "saw no
corruption" (Acts 13:37).

Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY

631 Jesus "descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who
descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens."475 The
Apostles' Creed confesses in the same article Christ's descent into hell
and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because in his
Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death that he made life
spring forth:
Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his
peaceful light on all mankind, your Son who lives and reigns for ever
and ever. Amen.476

Article 5 "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY
HE ROSE AGAIN"
Paragraph 1. CHRIST DESCENDED INTO HELL
632 The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was "raised
from the dead" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned in the
realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.477 This was the first
meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell:
that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the
others in the realm of the dead. But he descended there as Saviour,
proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.478
633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead Christ
went down, "hell" - Sheol in Hebrew or Hades in Greek - because
those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.479 Such is the
case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while they await the
Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is identical, as Jesus
shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus who was received
into "Abraham's bosom":480 "It is precisely these holy souls, who
awaited their Saviour in Abraham's bosom, whom Christ the Lord
delivered when he descended into hell."481 Jesus did not descend into
hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy the hell of damnation, but to
free the just who had gone before him.482
634 "The gospel was preached even to the dead."483 The descent into
hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfilment. This
is the last phase of Jesus' messianic mission, a phase which is
condensed in time but vast in its real significance: the spread of
Christ's redemptive work to all men of all times and all places, for all
who are saved have been made sharers in the redemption.
635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that "the dead will
hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."484
Jesus, "the Author of life", by dying destroyed "him who has the power
of death, that is, the devil, and [delivered] all those who through fear of
death were subject to lifelong bondage."485 Henceforth the risen
Christ holds "the keys of Death and Hades", so that "at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the
earth."486
Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great
stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. the earth trembled
and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh and he has raised
up all who have slept ever since the world began. . . He has gone to
search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep. Greatly desiring to
visit those who live in darkness and in the shadow of death, he has
gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve, captive with him
- He who is both their God and the son of Eve. . . "I am your God,
who for your sake have become your son. . . I order you, O sleeper, to
awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in hell. Rise from the dead,
for I am the life of the dead."487
IN BRIEF
636 By the expression "He descended into hell", the Apostles' Creed
confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us
conquered death and the devil "who has the power of death" (Heb
2:14).
637 In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ
went down to the realm of the dead. He opened heaven's gates for the
just who had gone before him.

Paragraph 2. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD
638 "We bring you the good news that what God promised to the
fathers, this day he has fulfilled to us their children by raising
Jesus."488 The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith
in Christ, a faith believed and lived as the central truth by the first
Christian community; handed on as fundamental by Tradition;
established by the documents of the New Testament; and preached as
an essential part of the Paschal mystery along with the cross:
Christ is risen from the dead!
Dying, he conquered death;
To the dead, he has given life.489
I. THE HISTORICAL AND TRANSCENDENT EVENT
639 The mystery of Christ's resurrection is a real event, with
manifestations that were historically verified, as the New Testament
bears witness. In about A.D. 56 St. Paul could already write to the
Corinthians: "I delivered to you as of first importance what I also
received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day
in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,
then to the Twelve. . ."490 The Apostle speaks here of the living
tradition of the Resurrection which he had learned after his conversion
at the gates of Damascus.491
The empty tomb
640 "Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but
has risen."492 The first element we encounter in the framework of the
Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a direct proof of
esurrection; the absence of Christ's body from the tomb could be
explained otherwise.493 Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an
essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step
toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case,
first with the holy women, and then with Peter.494 The disciple
"whom Jesus loved" affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb
and discovered "the linen cloths lying there", "he saw and
believed".495 This suggests that he realized from the empty tomb's
condition that the absence of Jesus' body could not have been of
human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as
had been the case with Lazarus.496
The appearances of the Risen One
641 Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish
anointing the body of Jesus, which had been buried in haste because
the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the first to
encounter the Risen One.497 Thus the women were the first
messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles themselves.498
They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter, then the Twelve.
Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his brothers,499 and so
sees the Risen One before them; it is on the basis of his testimony that
the community exclaims: "The Lord has risen indeed, and has
appeared to Simon!"500
642 Everything that happened during those Paschal days involves each
of the apostles - and Peter in particular - in the building of the new era
begun on Easter morning. As witnesses of the Risen One, they remain
the foundation stones of his Church. the faith of the first community of
believers is based on the witness of concrete men known to the
Christians and for the most part still living among them. Peter and the
Twelve are the primary "witnesses to his Resurrection", but they are
not the only ones - Paul speaks clearly of more than five hundred
persons to whom Jesus appeared on a single occasion and also of James
and of all the apostles.501
643 Given all these testimonies, Christ's Resurrection cannot be
interpreted as something outside the physical order, and it is
impossible not to acknowledge it as an historical fact. It is clear from
the facts that the disciples' faith was drastically put to the test by their
master's Passion and death on the cross, which he had foretold.502
The shock provoked by the Passion was so great that at least some of
the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the Resurrection.
Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation, the
Gospels present us with disciples demoralized ("looking sad"503) and
frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning from
the tomb and had regarded their words as an "idle tale".504 When
Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter evening, "he upbraided
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not
believed those who saw him after he had risen."505
644 Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are
still doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were
seeing a ghost. "In their joy they were still disbelieving and still
wondering."506 Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and St.
Matthew relates that during the risen Lord's last appearance in Galilee
"some doubted."507 Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection
was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up. On
the contrary their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action
of divine grace, from their direct experience of the reality of the risen
Jesus.
The condition of Christ's risen humanity
645 By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus
establishes direct contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way
to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen
body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been
tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion.508 Yet
at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties
of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present
how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be
confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine
realm.509 For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign
freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in
other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith.510
646 Christ's Resurrection was not a return to earthly life, as was the
case with the raisings from the dead that he had performed before
Easter: Jairus' daughter, the young man of Naim, Lazarus. These
actions were miraculous events, but the persons miraculously raised
returned by Jesus' power to ordinary earthly life. At some particular
moment they would die again. Christ's Resurrection is essentially
different. In his risen body he passes from the state of death to another
life beyond time and space. At Jesus' Resurrection his body is filled
with the power of the Holy Spirit: he shares the divine life in his
glorious state, so that St. Paul can say that Christ is "the man of
heaven".511
The Resurrection as transcendent event
647 O truly blessed Night, sings the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil, which
alone deserved to know the time and the hour when Christ rose from
the realm of the dead!512 But no one was an eyewitness to Christ's
Resurrection and no evangelist describes it. No one can say how it
came about physically. Still less was its innermost essence, his passing
over to another life, perceptible to the senses. Although the
Resurrection was an historical event that could be verified by the sign
of the empty tomb and by the reality of the apostles' encounters with
the risen Christ, still it remains at the very heart of the mystery of faith
as something that transcends and surpasses history. This is why the
risen Christ does not reveal himself to the world, but to his disciples,
"to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are
now his witnesses to the people."513
II. THE RESURRECTION - A WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY
648 Christ's Resurrection is an object of faith in that it is a
transcendent intervention of God himself in creation and history. In it
the three divine persons act together as one, and manifest their own
proper characteristics. the Father's power "raised up" Christ his Son
and by doing so perfectly introduced his Son's humanity, including his
body, into the Trinity. Jesus is conclusively revealed as "Son of God in
power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the
dead".514 St. Paul insists on the manifestation of God's power515
through the working of the Spirit who gave life to Jesus' dead humanity
and called it to the glorious state of Lordship.
649 As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his
divine power. Jesus announces that the Son of man will have to suffer
much, die, and then rise.516 Elsewhere he affirms explicitly: "I lay
down my life, that I may take it again. . . I have power to lay it down,
and I have power to take it again."517 "We believe that Jesus died and
rose again."518
650 The Fathers contemplate the Resurrection from the perspective of
the divine person of Christ who remained united to his soul and body,
even when these were separated from each other by death: "By the
unity of the divine nature, which remains present in each of the two
components of man, these are reunited. For as death is produced by
the separation of the human components, so Resurrection is achieved
by the union of the two."519
III. THE MEANING AND SAVING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
RESURRECTION
651 "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and
your faith is in vain."520 The Resurrection above all constitutes the
confirmation of all Christ's works and teachings. All truths, even those
most inaccessible to human reason, find their justification if Christ by
his Resurrection has given the definitive proof of his divine authority,
which he had promised.
652 Christ's Resurrection is the fulfilment of the promises both of the
Old Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly life.521 The
phrase "in accordance with the Scriptures"522 indicates that Christ's
Resurrection fulfilled these predictions.
653 The truth of Jesus' divinity is confirmed by his Resurrection. He
had said: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know
that I am he."523 The Resurrection of the crucified one shows that he
was truly "I AM", the Son of God and God himself. So St. Paul could
declare to the Jews: "What God promised to the fathers, this he has
fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the
second psalm, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'"524
Christ's Resurrection is closely linked to the Incarnation of God's Son,
and is its fulfilment in accordance with God's eternal plan.
654 The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates
us from sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life.
This new life is above all justification that reinstates us in God's grace,
"so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
we too might walk in newness of life." Justification consists in both
victory over the death caused by sin and a new participation in
grace.526 It brings about filial adoption so that men become Christ's
brethren, as Jesus himself called his disciples after his Resurrection:
"Go and tell my brethren."527 We are brethren not by nature, but by
the gift of grace, because that adoptive filiation gains us a real share in
the life of the only Son, which was fully revealed in his Resurrection.
655 Finally, Christ's Resurrection - and the risen Christ himself is the
principle and source of our future resurrection: "Christ has been raised
from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. . . For as
in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive."528 The risen
Christ lives in the hearts of his faithful while they await that fulfilment.
In Christ, Christians "have tasted. . . the powers of the age to
come"529 and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of
divine life, so that they may "live no longer for themselves but for him
who for their sake died and was raised."530
IN BRIEF
656 Faith in the Resurrection has as its object an event which as
historically attested to by the disciples, who really encountered the
Risen One. At the same time, this event is mysteriously transcendent
insofar as it is the entry of Christ's humanity into the glory of God.
657 The empty tomb and the linen cloths lying there signify in
themselves that by God's power Christ's body had escaped the bonds
of death and corruption. They prepared the disciples to encounter the
Risen Lord.
658 Christ, "the first-born from the dead" (Col 1:18), is the principle
of our own resurrection, even now by the justification of our souls (cf
Rom 6:4), and one day by the new life he will impart to our bodies (cf
Rom 8:11).

Article 6 "HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT
THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER"
659 "So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken
up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."531 Christ's
body was glorified at the moment of his Resurrection, as proved by the
new and supernatural properties it subsequently and permanently
enjoys.532 But during the forty days when he eats and drinks
familiarly with his disciples and teaches them about the kingdom, his
glory remains veiled under the appearance of ordinary humanity.533
Jesus' final apparition ends with the irreversible entry of his humanity
into divine glory, symbolized by the cloud and by heaven, where he is
seated from that time forward at God's right hand.534 Only in a
wholly exceptional and unique way would Jesus show himself to Paul
"as to one untimely born", in a last apparition that established him as
an apostle.535
660 The veiled character of the glory of the Risen One during this time
is intimated in his mysterious words to Mary Magdalene: "I have not
yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I
am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God."536 This indicates a difference in manifestation between the
glory of the risen Christ and that of the Christ exalted to the Father's
right hand, a transition marked by the historical and transcendent
event of the Ascension.
661 This final stage stays closely linked to the first, that is, to his
descent from heaven in the Incarnation. Only the one who "came from
the Father" can return to the Father: Christ Jesus.537 "No one has
ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of
man."538 Left to its own natural powers humanity does not have
access to the "Father's house", to God's life and happiness.539 Only
Christ can open to man such access that we, his members, might have
confidence that we too shall go where he, our Head and our Source,
has preceded us.540
662 "and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to
myself."541 The lifting up of Jesus on the cross signifies and
announces his lifting up by his Ascension into heaven, and indeed
begins it. Jesus Christ, the one priest of the new and eternal Covenant,
"entered, not into a sanctuary made by human hands. . . but into
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf."542
There Christ permanently exercises his priesthood, for he "always lives
to make intercession" for "those who draw near to God through
him".543 As "high priest of the good things to come" he is the centre
and the principal actor of the liturgy that honours the Father in
heaven.544
663 Henceforth Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father: "By
'the Father's right hand' we understand the glory and honour of
divinity, where he who exists as Son of God before all ages, indeed as
God, of one being with the Father, is seated bodily after he became
incarnate and his flesh was glorified."545
664 Being seated at the Father's right hand signifies the inauguration
of the Messiah's kingdom, the fulfilment of the prophet Daniel's vision
concerning the Son of man: "To him was given dominion and glory
and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve
him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."546 After this
event the apostles became witnesses of the "kingdom [that] will have
no end".547

IN BRIEF
665 Christ's Ascension marks the definitive entrance of Jesus' humanity
into God's heavenly domain, whence he will come again (cf Acts 1:11);
this humanity in the meantime hides him from the eyes of men (cf Col
3:3).
666 Jesus Christ, the head of the Church, precedes us into the Father's
glorious kingdom so that we, the members of his Body, may live in the
hope of one day being with him for ever.
667 Jesus Christ, having entered the sanctuary of heaven once and for
all, intercedes constantly for us as the mediator who assures us of the
permanent outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

Article 7 "FROM THENCE HE WILL COME AGAlN TO JUDGE
THE LIVING AND THE DEAD"
I. He Will Come Again in Glory
Christ already reigns through the Church. . .
668 "Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the
dead and of the living."548 Christ's Ascension into heaven signifies his
participation, in his humanity, in God's power and authority. Jesus
Christ is Lord: he possesses all power in heaven and on earth. He is
"far above all rule and authority and power and dominion", for the
Father "has put all things under his feet."549 Christ is Lord of the
cosmos and of history. In him human history and indeed all creation
are "set forth" and transcendently fulfilled.550
669 As Lord, Christ is also head of the Church, which is his Body.551
Taken up to heaven and glorified after he had thus fully accomplished
his mission, Christ dwells on earth in his Church. the redemption is
the source of the authority that Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit,
exercises over the Church. "The kingdom of Christ (is) already present
in mystery", "on earth, the seed and the beginning of the
kingdom".552
670 Since the Ascension God's plan has entered into its fulfilment. We
are already at "the last hour".553 "Already the final age of the world is
with us, and the renewal of the world is irrevocably under way; it is
even now anticipated in a certain real way, for the Church on earth is
endowed already with a sanctity that is real but imperfect."554 Christ's
kingdom already manifests its presence through the miraculous signs
that attend its proclamation by the Church.555
. . . until all things are subjected to him
671 Though already present in his Church, Christ's reign is
nevertheless yet to be fulfilled "with power and great glory" by the
King's return to earth.556 This reign is still under attack by the evil
powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ's
Passover.557 Until everything is subject to him, "until there be realized
new heavens and a new earth in which justice dwells, the pilgrim
Church, in her sacraments and institutions, which belong to this
present age, carries the mark of this world which will pass, and she
herself takes her place among the creatures which groan and travail yet
and await the revelation of the sons of God."558 That is why
Christians pray, above all in the Eucharist, to hasten Christ's return by
saying to him:559 Maranatha! "Our Lord, come!"560
672 Before his Ascension Christ affirmed that the hour had not yet
come for the glorious establishment of the messianic kingdom awaited
by Israel561 which, according to the prophets, was to bring all men the
definitive order of justice, love and peace.562 According to the Lord,
the present time is the time of the Spirit and of witness, but also a time
still marked by "distress" and the trial of evil which does not spare the
Church563 and ushers in the struggles of the last days. It is a time of
waiting and watching.564
The glorious advent of Christ, the hope of Israel
673 Since the Ascension Christ's coming in glory has been
imminent,565 even though "it is not for you to know times or seasons
which the Father has fixed by his own authority."566. This
eschatological coming could be accomplished at any moment, even if
both it and the final trial that will precede it are "delayed".567
674 The glorious Messiah's coming is suspended at every moment of
history until his recognition by "all Israel", for "a hardening has come
upon part of Israel" in their "unbelief" toward Jesus.568 St. Peter says
to the Jews of Jerusalem after Pentecost: "Repent therefore, and turn
again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may
come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ
appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for
establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from
of old."569 St. Paul echoes him: "For if their rejection means the
reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life
from the dead?"570 The "full inclusion" of the Jews in the Messiah's
salvation, in the wake of "the full number of the Gentiles",571 will
enable the People of God to achieve "the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ", in which "God may be all in all".572
The Church's ultimate trial
675 Before Christ's second coming the Church must pass through a
final trial that will shake the faith of many believers.573 The
persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth574 will unveil
the "mystery of iniquity" in the form of a religious deception offering
men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy
from the truth. the supreme religious deception is that of the
Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in
place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh.575
676 The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the
world every time the claim is made to realize within history that
messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the
eschatological judgement. the Church has rejected even modified
forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of
millenarianism,576 especially the "intrinsically perverse" political form
of a secular messianism.577
677 The Church will enter the glory of the kingdom only through this
final Passover, when she will follow her Lord in his death and
Resurrection.578 The kingdom will be fulfilled, then, not by a historic
triumph of the Church through a progressive ascendancy, but only by
God's victory over the final unleashing of evil, which will cause his
Bride to come down from heaven.579 God's triumph over the revolt of
evil will take the form of the Last Judgement after the final cosmic
upheaval of this passing world.580

II. To Judge the Living and the Dead
678 Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus
announced the judgement of the Last Day in his preaching.581 Then
will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be brought to
light.582 Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of
God's grace as nothing be condemned.583 Our attitude to our
neighbour will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and divine
love.584 On the Last Day Jesus will say: "Truly I say to you, as you did
it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."585
679 Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive
judgement on the works and hearts of men belongs to him as redeemer
of the world. He "acquired" this right by his cross. the Father has given
"all judgement to the Son".586 Yet the Son did not come to judge, but
to save and to give the life he has in himself.587 By rejecting grace in
this life, one already judges oneself, receives according to one's works,
and can even condemn oneself for all eternity by rejecting the Spirit of
love.588

680 Christ the Lord already reigns through the Church, but all the
things of this world are not yet subjected to him. the triumph of
Christ's kingdom will not come about without one last assault by the
powers of evil.
681 On Judgement Day at the end of the world, Christ will come in
glory to achieve the definitive triumph of good over evil which, like the
wheat and the tares, have grown up together in the course of history.
682 When he comes at the end of time to judge the living and the
dead, the glorious Christ will reveal the secret disposition of hearts and
will render to each man according to his works, and according to his
acceptance or refusal of grace.

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
683 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit."1 "God
has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"'2
This knowledge of faith is possible only in the Holy Spirit: to be in
touch with Christ, we must first have been touched by the Holy Spirit.
He comes to meet us and kindles faith in us. By virtue of our Baptism,
the first sacrament of the faith, the Holy Spirit in the Church
communicates to us, intimately and personally, the life that originates
in the Father and is offered to us in the Son.
Baptism gives us the grace of new birth in God the Father, through his
Son, in the Holy Spirit. For those who bear God's Spirit are led to the
Word, that is, to the Son, and the Son presents them to the Father, and
the Father confers incorruptibility on them. and it is impossible to see
God's Son without the Spirit, and no one can approach the Father
without the Son, for the knowledge of the Father is the Son, and the
knowledge of God's Son is obtained through the Holy Spirit.3
684 Through his grace, the Holy Spirit is the first to awaken faith in us
and to communicate to us the new life, which is to "know the Father
and the one whom he has sent, Jesus Christ."4 But the Spirit is the last
of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be revealed. St. Gregory of
Nazianzus, the Theologian, explains this progression in terms of the
pedagogy of divine "condescension":
The Old Testament proclaimed the Father clearly, but the Son more
obscurely. the New Testament revealed the Son and gave us a glimpse
of the divinity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit dwells among us and grants
us a clearer vision of himself. It was not prudent, when the divinity of
the Father had not yet been confessed, to proclaim the Son openly
and, when the divinity of the Son was not yet admitted, to add the
Holy Spirit as an extra burden, to speak somewhat daringly.... By
advancing and progressing "from glory to glory," the light of the Trinity
will shine in ever more brilliant rays.5
685 To believe in the Holy Spirit is to profess that the Holy Spirit is
one of the persons of the Holy Trinity, consubstantial with the Father
and the Son: "with the Father and the Son he is worshipped and
glorified."6 For this reason, the divine mystery of the Holy Spirit was
already treated in the context of Trinitarian "theology." Here, however,
we have to do with the Holy Spirit only in the divine "economy."
686 The Holy Spirit is at work with the Father and the Son from the
beginning to the completion of the plan for our salvation. But in these
"end times," ushered in by the Son's redeeming Incarnation, the Spirit
is revealed and given, recognized and welcomed as a person. Now can
this divine plan, accomplished in Christ, the firstborn and head of the
new creation, be embodied in mankind by the outpouring of the Spirit:
as the Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

ARTICLE 8 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT"
687 "No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of
God."7 Now God's Spirit, who reveals God, makes known to us
Christ, his Word, his living Utterance, but the Spirit does not speak of
himself. the Spirit who "has spoken through the prophets" makes us
hear the Father's Word, but we do not hear the Spirit himself. We know
him only in the movement by which he reveals the Word to us and
disposes us to welcome him in faith. the Spirit of truth who "unveils"
Christ to us "will not speak on his own."8 Such properly divine self-
effacement explains why "the world cannot receive (him), because it
neither sees him nor knows him," while those who believe in Christ
know the Spirit because he dwells with them.9
688 The Church, a communion living in the faith of the apostles which
she transmits, is the place where we know the Holy Spirit:
- in the Scriptures he inspired;
- in the Tradition, to which the Church Fathers are always timely
witnesses;
- in the Church's Magisterium, which he assists;
- in the sacramental liturgy, through its words and symbols, in which
the Holy Spirit puts us into communion with Christ;
- in prayer, wherein he intercedes for us;
- in the charisms and ministries by which the Church is built up;
- in the signs of apostolic and missionary life;
- in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness and
continues the work of salvation.

I. The Joint Mission of the Son and the Spirit
689 The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the Spirit of
his Son, is truly God.10 Consubstantial with the Father and the Son,
the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner life of the Trinity
and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy Trinity, life-
giving, consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church's faith also professes
the distinction of persons. When the Father sends his Word, he always
sends his Breath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy Spirit are
distinct but inseparable. To be sure, it is Christ who is seen, the visible
image of the invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals him.
690 Jesus is Christ, "anointed," because the Spirit is his anointing, and
everything that occurs from the Incarnation on derives from this
fullness.11 When Christ is finally glorified,12 he can in turn send the
Spirit from his place with the Father to those who believe in him: he
communicates to them his glory,13 that is, the Holy Spirit who
glorifies him.14 From that time on, this joint mission will be
manifested in the children adopted by the Father in the Body of his
Son: the mission of the Spirit of adoption is to unite them to Christ
and make them live in him:
The notion of anointing suggests . . . that there is no distance between
the Son and the Spirit. Indeed, just as between the surface of the body
and the anointing with oil neither reason nor sensation recognizes any
intermediary, so the contact of the Son with the Spirit is immediate, so
that anyone who would make contact with the Son by faith must first
encounter the oil by contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered
by the Holy Spirit. That is why the confession of the Son's Lordship is
made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive him, the Spirit coming
from all sides to those who approach the Son in faith.15

II. The Name, Titles, and Symbols of the Holy Spirit
The proper name of the Holy Spirit
691 "Holy Spirit" is the proper name of the one whom we adore and
glorify with the Father and the Son. the Church has received this name
from the Lord and professes it in the Baptism of her new children.16
The term "Spirit" translates the Hebrew word ruah, which, in its
primary sense, means breath, air, wind. Jesus indeed uses the sensory
image of the wind to suggest to Nicodemus the transcendent newness
of him who is personally God's breath, the divine Spirit.17 On the
other hand, "Spirit" and "Holy" are divine attributes common to the
three divine persons. By joining the two terms, Scripture, liturgy, and
theological language designate the inexpressible person of the Holy
Spirit, without any possible equivocation with other uses of the terms
"spirit" and "holy."
Titles of the Holy Spirit
692 When he proclaims and promises the coming of the Holy Spirit,
Jesus calls him the "Paraclete," literally, "he who is called to one's side,"
advocatus.18 "Paraclete" is commonly translated by "consoler," and
Jesus is the first consoler.19 The Lord also called the Holy Spirit "the
Spirit of truth."20
693 Besides the proper name of "Holy Spirit," which is most
frequently used in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles, we also
find in St. Paul the titles: the Spirit of the promise,21 The Spirit of
adoption,22 The Spirit of Christ,23 The Spirit of the Lord,24 and the
Spirit of God25 - and, in St. Peter, the Spirit of glory.26
Symbols of the Holy Spirit
694 Water. the symbolism of water signifies the Holy Spirit's action in
Baptism, since after the invocation of the Holy Spirit it becomes the
efficacious sacramental sign of new birth: just as the gestation of our
first birth took place in water, so the water of Baptism truly signifies
that our birth into the divine life is given to us in the Holy Spirit. As
"by one Spirit we were all baptized," so we are also "made to drink of
one Spirit."27 Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling
up from Christ crucified28 as its source and welling up in us to eternal
life.29
695 Anointing. the symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the
Holy Spirit,30 to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit.
In Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of
Confirmation, called "chrismation" in the Churches of the East. Its full
force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing
accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew
"messiah") means the one "anointed" by God's Spirit. There were
several anointed ones of the Lord in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently
King David.31 But Jesus is God's Anointed in a unique way: the
humanity the Son assumed was entirely anointed by the Holy Spirit.
the Holy Spirit established him as "Christ."32 The Virgin Mary
conceived Christ by the Holy Spirit who, through the angel,
proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come
to the temple to see the Christ of the Lord.33 The Spirit filled Christ
and the power of the Spirit went out from him in his acts of healing
and of saving.34 Finally, it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the
dead.35 Now, fully established as "Christ" in his humanity victorious
over death, Jesus pours out the Holy Spirit abundantly until "the
saints" constitute - in their union with the humanity of the Son of God
- that perfect man "to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ":36 "the whole Christ," in St. Augustine's expression.
696 Fire. While water signifies birth and the fruitfulness of life given in
the Holy Spirit, fire symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy
Spirit's actions. the prayer of the prophet Elijah, who "arose like fire"
and whose "word burned like a torch," brought down fire from heaven
on the sacrifice on Mount Carmel.37 This event was a "figure" of the
fire of the Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches. John the
Baptist, who goes "before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah,"
proclaims Christ as the one who "will baptize you with the Holy Spirit
and with fire."38 Jesus will say of the Spirit: "I came to cast fire upon
the earth; and would that it were already kindled!"39 In the form of
tongues "as of fire," the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the
morning of Pentecost and fills them with himself40 The spiritual
tradition has retained this symbolism of fire as one of the most
expressive images of the Holy Spirit's actions.41 "Do not quench the
Spirit."42
697 Cloud and light. These two images occur together in the
manifestations of the Holy Spirit. In the theophanies of the Old
Testament, the cloud, now obscure, now luminous, reveals the living
and saving God, while veiling the transcendence of his glory - with
Moses on Mount Sinai,43 at the tent of meeting,44 and during the
wandering in the desert,45 and with Solomon at the dedication of the
Temple.46 In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills these figures. the Spirit
comes upon the Virgin Mary and "overshadows" her, so that she might
conceive and give birth to Jesus.47 On the mountain of
Transfiguration, the Spirit in the "cloud came and overshadowed"
Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and "a voice came out
of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!'"48
Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on the day
of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the day
of his final coming.49
698 The seal is a symbol close to that of anointing. "The Father has set
his seal" on Christ and also seals us in him.50 Because this seal
indicates the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy Spirit in
the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image
of the seal (sphragis) has been used in some theological traditions to
express the indelible "character" imprinted by these three unrepeatable
sacraments.
699 The hand. Jesus heals the sick and blesses little children by laying
hands on them.51 In his name the apostles will do the same.52 Even
more pointedly, it is by the Apostles' imposition of hands that the Holy
Spirit is given.53 The Letter to the Hebrews lists the imposition of
hands among the "fundamental elements" of its teaching.54 The
Church has kept this sign of the all-powerful outpouring of the Holy
Spirit in its sacramental epicleses.
700 The finger. "It is by the finger of God that [Jesus] cast out
demons."55 If God's law was written on tablets of stone "by the finger
of God," then the "letter from Christ" entrusted to the care of the
apostles, is written "with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of
stone, but on tablets of human hearts."56 The hymn Veni Creator
Spiritus invokes the Holy Spirit as the "finger of the Father's right
hand."57
701 The dove. At the end of the flood, whose symbolism refers to
Baptism, a dove released by Noah returns with a fresh olive-tree
branch in its beak as a sign that the earth was again habitable.58 When
Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the
form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.59 The
Spirit comes down and remains in the purified hearts of the baptized.
In certain churches, the Eucharist is reserved in a metal receptacle in
the form of a dove (columbarium) suspended above the altar. Christian
iconography traditionally uses a dove to suggest the Spirit.

III. God's Spirit and Word in the Time of the Promises
702 From the beginning until "the fullness of time,"60 The joint
mission of the Father's Word and Spirit remains hidden, but it is at
work. God's Spirit prepares for the time of the Messiah. Neither is fully
revealed but both are already promised, to be watched for and
welcomed at their manifestation. So, for this reason, when the Church
reads the Old Testament, she searches there for what the Spirit, "who
has spoken through the prophets," wants to tell us about Christ.61
By "prophets" the faith of the Church here understands all whom the
Holy Spirit inspired in living proclamation and in the composition of
the sacred books, both of the Old and the New Testaments. Jewish
tradition distinguishes first the Law (the five first books or
Pentateuch), then the Prophets (our historical and prophetic books)
and finally the Writings (especially the wisdom literature, in particular
the Psalms).62
In creation
703 The Word of God and his Breath are at the origin of the being and
life of every creature:63
It belongs to the Holy Spirit to rule, sanctify, and animate creation, for
he is God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son.... Power over
life pertains to the Spirit, for being God he preserves creation in the
Father through the Son.64
704 "God fashioned man with his own hands [that is, the Son and the
Holy Spirit] and impressed his own form on the flesh he had
fashioned, in such a way that even what was visible might bear the
divine form."65
The Spirit of the promise
705 Disfigured by sin and death, man remains "in the image of God,"
in the image of the Son, but is deprived "of the glory of God,"66 of his
"likeness." the promise made to Abraham inaugurates the economy of
salvation, at the culmination of which the Son himself will assume that
"image"67 and restore it in the Father's "likeness" by giving it again its
Glory, the Spirit who is "the giver of life."
706 Against all human hope, God promises descendants to Abraham,
as the fruit of faith and of the power of the Holy Spirit.68 In
Abraham's progeny all the nations of the earth will be blessed. This
progeny will be Christ himself,69 in whom the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit will "gather into one the children of God who are scattered
abroad."70 God commits himself by his own solemn oath to giving his
beloved Son and "the promised Holy Spirit . . . [who is] the guarantee
of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it."71
In Theophanies and the Law
707 Theophanies (manifestations of God) light up the way of the
promise, from the patriarchs to Moses and from Joshua to the visions
that inaugurated the missions of the great prophets. Christian tradition
has always recognized that God's Word allowed himself to be seen and
heard in these theophanies, in which the cloud of the Holy Spirit both
revealed him and concealed him in its shadow.
708 This divine pedagogy appears especially in the gift of the Law.72
God gave the Law as a "pedagogue" to lead his people towards
Christ.73 But the Law's powerlessness to save man deprived of the
divine "likeness," along with the growing awareness of sin that it
imparts,74 enkindles a desire for the Holy Spirit. The lamentations of
the Psalms bear witness to this.
In the Kingdom and the Exile
709 The Law, the sign of God's promise and covenant, ought to have
governed the hearts and institutions of that people to whom Abraham's
faith gave birth. "If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, . . .
you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."75 But after
David, Israel gave in to the temptation of becoming a kingdom like
other nations. the Kingdom, however, the object of the promise made
to David,76 would be the work of the Holy Spirit; it would belong to
the poor according to the Spirit.
710 The forgetting of the Law and the infidelity to the covenant end in
death: it is the Exile, apparently the failure of the promises, which is in
fact the mysterious fidelity of the Savior God and the beginning of a
promised restoration, but according to the Spirit. the People of God
had to suffer this purification.77 In God's plan, the Exile already
stands in the shadow of the Cross, and the Remnant of the poor that
returns from the Exile is one of the most transparent prefigurations of
the Church.
Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit
711 "Behold, I am doing a new thing."78 Two prophetic lines were to
develop, one leading to the expectation of the Messiah, the other
pointing to the announcement of a new Spirit. They converge in the
small Remnant, the people of the poor, who await in hope the
"consolation of Israel" and "the redemption of Jerusalem."79
We have seen earlier how Jesus fulfills the prophecies concerning
himself. We limit ourselves here to those in which the relationship of
the Messiah and his Spirit appears more clearly.
712 The characteristics of the awaited Messiah begin to appear in the
"Book of Emmanuel" ("Isaiah said this when he saw his glory,"80
speaking of Christ), especially in the first two verses of Isaiah 11: 81
There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
and the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,
the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
713 The Messiah's characteristics are revealed above all in the "Servant
songs."82 These songs proclaim the meaning of Jesus' Passion and
show how he will pour out the Holy Spirit to give life to the many: not
as an outsider, but by embracing our "form as slave."83 Taking our
death upon himself, he can communicate to us his own Spirit of life.
714 This is why Christ inaugurates the proclamation of the Good
News by making his own the following passage from Isaiah:84
The Spirit of the LORD God is upon me, because the LORD has
anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me to
bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of
the LORD'S favor.
715 The prophetic texts that directly concern the sending of the Holy
Spirit are oracles by which God speaks to the heart of his people in the
language of the promise, with the accents of "love and fidelity."85 St.
Peter will proclaim their fulfillment on the morning of Pentecost.86
According to these promises, at the "end time" the Lord's Spirit will
renew the hearts of men, engraving a new law in them. He will gather
and reconcile the scattered and divided peoples; he will transform the
first creation, and God will dwell there with men in peace.
716 The People of the "poor"87 - those who, humble and meek, rely
solely on their God's mysterious plans, who await the justice, not of
men but of the Messiah - are in the end the great achievement of the
Holy Spirit's hidden mission during the time of the promises that
prepare for Christ's coming. It is this quality of heart, purified and
enlightened by the Spirit, which is expressed in the Psalms. In these
poor, the Spirit is making ready "a people prepared for the Lord."88

IV. The Spirit of Christ in the Fullness of Time
John, precursor, prophet, and baptist
717 "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."89 John
was "filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb"90 by
Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just conceived by the Holy
Spirit. Mary's visitation to Elizabeth thus became a visit from God to
his people.91
718 John is "Elijah (who) must come."92 The fire of the Spirit dwells
in him and makes him the forerunner of the coming Lord. In John, the
precursor, the Holy Spirit completes the work of "[making] ready a
people prepared for the Lord."93
719 John the Baptist is "more than a prophet."94 In him, the Holy
Spirit concludes his speaking through the prophets. John completes the
cycle of prophets begun by Elijah.95 He proclaims the imminence of
the consolation of Israel; he is the "voice" of the Consoler who is
coming.96 As the Spirit of truth will also do, John "came to bear
witness to the light."97 In John's sight, the Spirit thus brings to
completion the careful search of the prophets and fulfills the longing of
the angels.98 "He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain,
this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. and I have seen and have
borne witness that this is the Son of God.... Behold, the Lamb of
God."99
720 Finally, with John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit begins the
restoration to man of "the divine likeness," prefiguring what he would
achieve with and in Christ. John's baptism was for repentance; baptism
in water and the Spirit will be a new birth.100
"Rejoice, you who are full of grace"
721 Mary, the all-holy ever-virgin Mother of God, is the masterwork of
the mission of the Son and the Spirit in the fullness of time. For the
first time in the plan of salvation and because his Spirit had prepared
her, the Father found the dwelling place where his Son and his Spirit
could dwell among men. In this sense the Church's Tradition has often
read the most beautiful texts on wisdom in relation to Mary.101 Mary
is acclaimed and represented in the liturgy as the "Seat of Wisdom."
In her, the "wonders of God" that the Spirit was to fulfill in Christ and
the Church began to be manifested:
722 The Holy Spirit prepared Mary by his grace. It was fitting that the
mother of him in whom "the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily"102
should herself be "full of grace." She was, by sheer grace, conceived
without sin as the most humble of creatures, the most capable of
welcoming the inexpressible gift of the Almighty. It was quite correct
for the angel Gabriel to greet her as the "Daughter of Zion":
"Rejoice."103 It is the thanksgiving of the whole People of God, and
thus of the Church, which Mary in her canticle104 lifts up to the
Father in the Holy Spirit while carrying within her the eternal Son.
723 In Mary, the Holy Spirit fulfills the plan of the Father's loving
goodness. Through the Holy Spirit, the Virgin conceives and gives birth
to the Son of God. By the Holy Spirit's power and her faith, her
virginity became uniquely fruitful.105
724 In Mary, the Holy Spirit manifests the Son of the Father, now
become the Son of the Virgin. She is the burning bush of the definitive
theophany. Filled with the Holy Spirit she makes the Word visible in
the humility of his flesh. It is to the poor and the first representatives of
the gentiles that she makes him known.106
725 Finally, through Mary, the Holy Spirit begins to bring men, the
objects of God's merciful love,107 into communion with Christ. and
the humble are always the first to accept him: shepherds, magi, Simeon
and Anna, the bride and groom at Cana, and the first disciples.
726 At the end of this mission of the Spirit, Mary became the Woman,
the new Eve ("mother of the living"), the mother of the "whole
Christ."108 As such, she was present with the Twelve, who "with one
accord devoted themselves to prayer,"109 at the dawn of the "end
time" which the Spirit was to inaugurate on the morning of Pentecost
with the manifestation of the Church.
Christ Jesus
727 The entire mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit, in the fullness
of time, is contained in this: that the Son is the one anointed by the
Father's Spirit since his Incarnation - Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah.
Everything in the second chapter of the Creed is to be read in this
light. Christ's whole work is in fact a joint mission of the Son and the
Holy Spirit. Here, we shall mention only what has to do with Jesus'
promise of the Holy Spirit and the gift of him by the glorified Lord.
728 Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself has
been glorified through his Death and Resurrection. Nevertheless, little
by little he alludes to him even in his teaching of the multitudes, as
when he reveals that his own flesh will be food for the life of the
world.110 He also alludes to the Spirit in speaking to Nicodemus,111
to the Samaritan woman,112 and to those who take part in the feast of
Tabernacles.113 To his disciples he speaks openly of the Spirit in
connection with prayer114 and with the witness they will have to
bear.115
729 Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does Jesus
promise the coming of the Holy Spirit, since his Death and
Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers.116 The Spirit
of truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in answer to
Jesus' prayer; he will be sent by the Father in Jesus' name; and Jesus
will send him from the Father's side, since he comes from the Father.
the Holy Spirit will come and we shall know him; he will be with us for
ever; he will remain with us. the Spirit will teach us everything, remind
us of all that Christ said to us and bear witness to him. the Holy Spirit
will lead us into all truth and will glorify Christ. He will prove the
world wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment.
730 At last Jesus' hour arrives:117 he commends his spirit into the
Father's hands118 at the very moment when by his death he conquers
death, so that, "raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,"119 he
might immediately give the Holy Spirit by "breathing" on his
disciples.120 From this hour onward, the mission of Christ and the
Spirit becomes the mission of the Church: "As the Father has sent me,
even so I send you."121

V. The Spirit and the Church In the Last Days
Pentecost
731 On the day of Pentecost when the seven weeks of Easter had come
to an end, Christ's Passover is fulfilled in the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, manifested, given, and communicated as a divine person: of his
fullness, Christ, the Lord, pours out the Spirit in abundance.122
732 On that day, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed. Since that day, the
Kingdom announced by Christ has been open to those who believe in
him: in the humility of the flesh and in faith, they already share in the
communion of the Holy Trinity. By his coming, which never ceases, the
Holy Spirit causes the world to enter into the "last days," the time of
the Church, the Kingdom already inherited though not yet
consummated.
We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly Spirit, we
have found the true faith: we adore the indivisible Trinity, who has
saved us.123
The Holy Spirit - God's gift
733 "God is Love"124 and love is his first gift, containing all others.
"God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
who has been given to us."125
734 Because we are dead or at least wounded through sin, the first
effect of the gift of love is the forgiveness of our sins. the communion
of the Holy Spirit126 in the Church restores to the baptized the divine
likeness lost through sin.
735 He, then, gives us the "pledge" or "first fruits" of our inheritance:
the very life of the Holy Trinity, which is to love as "God (has) loved
us."127 This love (the "charity" of 1 Cor 13) is the source of the new
life in Christ, made possible because we have received "power" from
the Holy Spirit.128
736 By this power of the Spirit, God's children can bear much fruit.
He who has grafted us onto the true vine will make us bear "the fruit
of the Spirit: . . . love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."129 "We live by the Spirit"; the
more we renounce ourselves, the more we "walk by the Spirit."130
Through the Holy Spirit we are restored to paradise, led back to the
Kingdom of heaven, and adopted as children, given confidence to call
God "Father" and to share in Christ's grace, called children of light
and given a share in eternal glory.131
The Holy Spirit and the Church
737 The mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit is brought to
completion in the Church, which is the Body of Christ and the Temple
of the Holy Spirit. This joint mission henceforth brings Christ's faithful
to share in his communion with the Father in the Holy Spirit. the
Spirit prepares men and goes out to them with his grace, in order to
draw them to Christ. the Spirit manifests the risen Lord to them,
recalls his word to them and opens their minds to the understanding of
his Death and Resurrection. He makes present the mystery of Christ,
supremely in the Eucharist, in order to reconcile them, to bring them
into communion with God, that they may "bear much fruit."132
738 Thus the Church's mission is not an addition to that of Christ and
the Holy Spirit, but is its sacrament: in her whole being and in all her
members, the Church is sent to announce, bear witness, make present,
and spread the mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity (the
topic of the next article):
All of us who have received one and the same Spirit, that is, the Holy
Spirit, are in a sense blended together with one another and with God.
For if Christ, together with the Father's and his own Spirit, comes to
dwell in each of us, though we are many, still the Spirit is one and
undivided. He binds together the spirits of each and every one of us, . .
. and makes all appear as one in him. For just as the power of Christ's
sacred flesh unites those in whom it dwells into one body, I think that
in the same way the one and undivided Spirit of God, who dwells in
all, leads all into spiritual unity.133
739 Because the Holy Spirit is the anointing of Christ, it is Christ who,
as the head of the Body, pours out the Spirit among his members to
nourish, heal, and organize them in their mutual functions, to give
them life, send them to bear witness, and associate them to his self-
offering to the Father and to his intercession for the whole world.
Through the Church's sacraments, Christ communicates his Holy and
sanctifying Spirit to the members of his Body. (This will be the topic of
Part Two of the Catechism.)
740 These "mighty works of God," offered to believers in the
sacraments of the Church, bear their fruit in the new life in Christ,
according to the Spirit. (This will be the topic of Part Three.)
741 "The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to
pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with sighs too deep
for words."134 The Holy Spirit, the artisan of God's works, is the
master of prayer. (This will be the topic of Part Four.)

IN BRIEF
742 "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our
hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"' (Gal 4:6).
743 From the beginning to the end of time, whenever God sends his
Son, he always sends his Spirit: their mission is conjoined and
inseparable.
744 In the fullness of time the Holy Spirit completes in Mary all the
preparations for Christ's coming among the People of God. By the
action of the Holy Spirit in her, the Father gives the world Emmanuel
"God-with-us" (Mt 1:23).
745 The Son of God was consecrated as Christ (Messiah) by the
anointing of the Holy Spirit at his Incarnation (cf Ps 2:6-7).
746 By his Death and his Resurrection, Jesus is constituted in glory as
Lord and Christ (cf Acts 2:36). From his fullness, he poured out the
Holy Spirit on the apostles and the Church.
747 The Holy Spirit, whom Christ the head pours out on his members,
builds, animates, and sanctifies the Church. She is the sacrament of the
Holy Trinity's communion with men.

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"
748 "Christ is the light of humanity; and it is, accordingly, the heart-
felt desire of this sacred Council, being gathered together in the Holy
Spirit, that, by proclaiming his Gospel to every creature, it may bring
to all men that light of Christ which shines out visibly from the
Church."135 These words open the Second Vatican Council's
Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. By choosing this starting point,
the Council demonstrates that the article of faith about the Church
depends entirely on the articles concerning Christ Jesus. the Church
has no other light than Christ's; according to a favorite image of the
Church Fathers, the Church is like the moon, all its light reflected
from the sun.
749 The article concerning the Church also depends entirely on the
article about the Holy Spirit, which immediately precedes it. "Indeed,
having shown that the Spirit is the source and giver of all holiness, we
now confess that it is he who has endowed the Church with
holiness."136 The Church is, in a phrase used by the Fathers, the place
"where the Spirit flourishes."137
750 To believe that the Church is "holy" and "catholic," and that she is
"one" and "apostolic" (as the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from
belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the Apostles'
Creed we profess "one Holy Church" (Credo . . . Ecclesiam), and not
to believe in the Church, so as not to confuse God with his works and
to attribute clearly to God's goodness all the gifts he has bestowed on
his Church.138

Paragraph 1. THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN
I. NAMES AND IMAGES OF THE CHURCH
751 The word "Church" (Latin ecclesia, from the Greek ek-ka-lein, to
"call out of") means a convocation or an assembly. It designates the
assemblies of the people, usually for a religious purpose.139 Ekklesia is
used frequently in the Greek Old Testament for the assembly of the
Chosen People before God, above all for their assembly on Mount
Sinai where Israel received the Law and was established by God as his
holy people.140 By calling itself "Church," the first community of
Christian believers recognized itself as heir to that assembly. In the
Church, God is "calling together" his people from all the ends of the
earth. the equivalent Greek term Kyriake, from which the English
word Church and the German Kirche are derived, means "what
belongs to the Lord."
752 In Christian usage, the word "church" designates the liturgical
assembly,141 but also the local community142 or the whole universal
community of believers.143 These three meanings are inseparable.
"The Church" is the People that God gathers in the whole world. She
exists in local communities and is made real as a liturgical, above all a
Eucharistic, assembly. She draws her life from the word and the Body
of Christ and so herself becomes Christ's Body.
Symbols of the Church
753 In Scripture, we find a host of interrelated images and figures
through which Revelation speaks of the inexhaustible mystery of the
Church. the images taken from the Old Testament are variations on a
profound theme: the People of God. In the New Testament, all these
images find a new center because Christ has become the head of this
people, which henceforth is his Body.144 Around this center are
grouped images taken "from the life of the shepherd or from
cultivation of the land, from the art of building or from family life and
marriage."145
754 "The Church is, accordingly, a sheepfold, the sole and necessary
gateway to which is Christ. It is also the flock of which God himself
foretold that he would be the shepherd, and whose sheep, even though
governed by human shepherds, are unfailingly nourished and led by
Christ himself, the Good Shepherd and Prince of Shepherds, who gave
his life for his sheep.146
755 "The Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land
the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in
which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about
and will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has
been planted by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who
gives life and fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through
the Church remain in Christ, without whom we can do nothing.147
756 "Often, too, the Church is called the building of God. the Lord
compared himself to the stone which the builders rejected, but which
was made into the comer-stone. On this foundation the Church is built
by the apostles and from it the Church receives solidity and unity. This
edifice has many names to describe it: the house of God in which his
family dwells; the household of God in the Spirit; the dwelling-place of
God among men; and, especially, the holy temple. This temple,
symbolized in places of worship built out of stone, is praised by the
Fathers and, not without reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy
City, the New Jerusalem. As living stones we here on earth are built
into it. It is this holy city that is seen by John as it comes down out of
heaven from God when the world is made anew, prepared like a bride
adorned for her husband.148
757 "The Church, further, which is called 'that Jerusalem which is
above' and 'our mother', is described as the spotless spouse of the
spotless lamb. It is she whom Christ 'loved and for whom he delivered
himself up that he might sanctify her.' It is she whom he unites to
himself by an unbreakable alliance, and whom he constantly 'nourishes
and cherishes.'"149
II. THE CHURCH'S ORIGIN, FOUNDATION AND MISSION
758 We begin our investigation of the Church's mystery by meditating
on her origin in the Holy Trinity's plan and her progressive realization
in history.
A plan born in the Father's heart
759 "The eternal Father, in accordance with the utterly gratuitous and
mysterious design of his wisdom and goodness, created the whole
universe and chose to raise up men to share in his own divine life,"150
to which he calls all men in his Son. "The Father . . . determined to
call together in a holy Church those who should believe in Christ."151
This "family of God" is gradually formed and takes shape during the
stages of human history, in keeping with the Father's plan. In fact,
"already present in figure at the beginning of the world, this Church
was prepared in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of
Israel and the old Advance. Established in this last age of the world
and made manifest in the utpouring of the Spirit, it will be brought to
glorious completion at the end of time."152
The Church - foreshadowed from the world's beginning
760 Christians of the first centuries said, "The world was created for
the sake of the Church."153 God created the world for the sake of
communion with his divine life, a communion brought about by the
"convocation" of men in Christ, and this "convocation" is the Church.
the Church is the goal of all things,154 and God permitted such
painful upheavals as the angels' fall and man's sin only as occasions and
means for displaying all the power of his arm and the whole measure of
the love he wanted to give the world:
Just as God's will is creation and is called "the world," so his intention
is the salvation of men, and it is called "the Church."155
The Church - prepared for in the Old Covenant
761 The gathering together of the People of God began at the moment
when sin destroyed the communion of men with God, and that of men
among themselves. the gathering together of the Church is, as it were,
God's reaction to the chaos provoked by sin. This reunification is
achieved secretly in the heart of all peoples: "In every nation anyone
who fears him and does what is right is acceptable" to God.156
762 The remote preparation for this gathering together of the People of
God begins when he calls Abraham and promises that he will become
the father of a great people.157 Its immediate preparation begins with
Israel's election as the People of God. By this election, Israel is to be
the sign of the future gathering of All nations.158 But the prophets
accuse Israel of breaking the covenant and behaving like a prostitute.
They announce a new and eternal covenant. "Christ instituted this
New Covenant."159
The Church - instituted by Christ Jesus
763 It was the Son's task to accomplish the Father's plan of salvation in
the fullness of time. Its accomplishment was the reason for his being
sent.160 "The Lord Jesus inaugurated his Church by preaching the
Good News, that is, the coming of the Reign of God, promised over
the ages in the scriptures."161 To fulfill the Father's will, Christ
ushered in the Kingdom of heaven on earth. the Church "is the Reign
of Christ already present in mystery."162
764 "This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the works
and in the presence of Christ."163 To welcome Jesus' word is to
welcome "the Kingdom itself."164 The seed and beginning of the
Kingdom are the "little flock" of those whom Jesus came to gather
around him, the flock whose shepherd he is.165 They form Jesus' true
family.166 To those whom he thus gathered around him, he taught a
new "way of acting" and a prayer of their own.167
765 The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure that will
remain until the Kingdom is fully achieved. Before all else there is the
choice of the Twelve with Peter as their head.168 Representing the
twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new
Jerusalem.169 The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ's
mission and his power, but also in his lot.170 By all his actions, Christ
prepares and builds his Church.
766 The Church is born primarily of Christ's total self-giving for our
salvation, anticipated in the institution of the Eucharist and fulfilled on
the cross. "The origin and growth of the Church are symbolized by the
blood and water which flowed from the open side of the crucified
Jesus."171 "For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of
death upon the cross that there came forth the 'wondrous sacrament of
the whole Church.'"172 As Eve was formed from the sleeping Adam's
side, so the Church was born from the pierced heart of Christ hanging
dead on the cross.173
The Church - revealed by the Holy Spirit
767 "When the work which the Father gave the Son to do on earth was
accomplished, the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in
order that he might continually sanctify the Church."174 Then "the
Church was openly displayed to the crowds and the spread of the
Gospel among the nations, through preaching, was begun."175 As the
"convocation" of all men for salvation, the Church in her very nature is
missionary, sent by Christ to all the nations to make disciples of
them.176
768 So that she can fulfill her mission, the Holy Spirit "bestows upon
[the Church] varied hierarchic and charismatic gifts, and in this way
directs her."177 "Henceforward the Church, endowed with the gifts of
her founder and faithfully observing his precepts of charity, humility
and self-denial, receives the mission of proclaiming and establishing
among all peoples the Kingdom of Christ and of God, and she is on
earth the seed and the beginning of that kingdom."178
The Church - perfected in glory
769 "The Church . . . will receive its perfection only in the glory of
heaven,"179 at the time of Christ's glorious return. Until that day, "the
Church progresses on her pilgrimage amidst this world's persecutions
and God's consolations."180 Here below she knows that she is in exile
far from the Lord, and longs for the full coming of the Kingdom, when
she will "be united in glory with her king."181 The Church, and
through her the world, will not be perfected in glory without great
trials. Only then will "all the just from the time of Adam, 'from Abel,
the just one, to the last of the elect,' . . . be gathered together in the
universal Church in the Father's presence."182
III. THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH
770 The Church is in history, but at the same time she transcends it. It
is only "with the eyes of faith"183 that one can see her in her visible
reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as bearer of divine
life.
The Church - both visible and spiritual
771 "The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains here on
earth his holy Church, the community of faith, hope, and charity, as a
visible organization through which he communicates truth and grace
to all men."184 The Church is at the same time:


- a "society structured with hierarchical organs and the mystical body
of Christ;
- the visible society and the spiritual community;
- the earthly Church and the Church endowed with heavenly
riches."185
These dimensions together constitute "one complex reality which
comes together from a human and a divine element":186
The Church is essentially both human and divine, visible but endowed
with invisible realities, zealous in action and dedicated to
contemplation, present in the world, but as a pilgrim, so constituted
that in her the human is directed toward and subordinated to the
divine, the visible to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this
present world to that city yet to come, the object of our quest.187
O humility! O sublimity! Both tabernacle of cedar and sanctuary of
God; earthly dwelling and celestial palace; house of clay and royal hall;
body of death and temple of light; and at last both object of scorn to
the proud and bride of Christ! She is black but beautiful, O daughters
of Jerusalem, for even if the labor and pain of her long exile may have
discolored her, yet heaven's beauty has adorned her.188
The Church - mystery of men's union with God
772 It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery
as the purpose of God's plan: "to unite all things in him."189 St. Paul
calls the nuptial union of Christ and the Church "a great mystery."
Because she is united to Christ as to her bridegroom, she becomes a
mystery in her turn.190 Contemplating this mystery in her, Paul
exclaims: "Christ in you, the hope of glory."191
773 In the Church this communion of men with God, in the "love
[that] never ends," is the purpose which governs everything in her that
is a sacramental means, tied to this passing world.192
"[The Church's] structure is totally ordered to the holiness of Christ's
members. and holiness is measured according to the 'great mystery' in
which the Bride responds with the gift of love to the gift of the
Bridegroom."193 Mary goes before us all in the holiness that is the
Church's mystery as "the bride without spot or wrinkle."194 This is
why the "Marian" dimension of the Church precedes the "Petrine."195
The universal Sacrament of Salvation
774 The Greek word mysterion was translated into Latin by two terms:
mystenum and sacramentum. In later usage the term sacramentum
emphasizes the visible sign of the hidden reality of salvation which was
indicated by the term mystenum. In this sense, Christ himself is the
mystery of salvation: "For there is no other mystery of God, except
Christ."196 The saving work of his holy and sanctifying humanity is
the sacrament of salvation, which is revealed and active in the Church's
sacraments (which the Eastern Churches also call "the holy
mysteries"). the seven sacraments are the signs and instruments by
which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of Christ the head throughout
the Church which is his Body. the Church, then, both contains and
communicates the invisible grace she signifies. It is in this analogical
sense, that the Church is called a "sacrament."
775 "The Church, in Christ, is like a sacrament - a sign and
instrument, that is, of communion with God and of unity among all
men."197 The Church's first purpose is to be the sacrament of the
inner union of men with God. Because men's communion with one
another is rooted in that union with God, the Church is also the
sacrament of the unity of the human race. In her, this unity is already
begun, since she gathers men "from every nation, from all tribes and
peoples and tongues";198 at the same time, the Church is the "sign
and instrument" of the full realization of the unity yet to come.
776 As sacrament, the Church is Christ's instrument. "She is taken up
by him also as the instrument for the salvation of all," "the universal
sacrament of salvation," by which Christ is "at once manifesting and
actualizing the mystery of God's love for men."199 The Church "is the
visible plan of God's love for humanity," because God desires "that the
whole human race may become one People of God, form one Body of
Christ, and be built up into one temple of the Holy Spirit."200
IN BRIEF
777 The word "Church" means "convocation." It designates the
assembly of those whom God's Word "convokes," i.e., gathers together
to form the People of God, and who themselves, nourished with the
Body of Christ, become the Body of Christ.
778 The Church is both the means and the goal of God's plan:
prefigured in creation, prepared for in the Old Covenant, founded by
the words and actions of Jesus Christ, fulfilled by his redeeming cross
and his Resurrection, the Church has been manifested as the mystery
of salvation by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. She will be perfected
in the glory of heaven as the assembly of all the redeemed of the earth
(cf Rev 14:4).
779 The Church is both visible and spiritual, a hierarchical society and
the Mystical Body of Christ. She is one, yet formed of two
components, human and divine. That is her mystery, which only faith
can accept.
780 The Church in this world is the sacrament of salvation, the sign
and the instrument of the communion of God and men.

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"




Paragraph 2. THE CHURCH - PEOPLE OF GOD, BODY OF
CHRIST, TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
I. THE CHURCH - PEOPLE OF GOD
781 "At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and does
what is right has been acceptable to him. He has, however, willed to
make men holy and save them, not as individuals without any bond or
link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might
acknowledge him and serve him in holiness. He therefore chose the
Israelite race to be his own people and established a covenant with it.
He gradually instructed this people.... All these things, however,
happened as a preparation for and figure of that new and perfect
covenant which was to be ratified in Christ . . . the New Covenant in
his blood; he called together a race made up of Jews and Gentiles
which would be one, not according to the flesh, but in the Spirit."201
Characteristics of the People of Got
782 The People of God is marked by characteristics that clearly
distinguish it from all other religious, ethnic, political, or cultural
groups found in history:
- It is the People of God: God is not the property of any one people.
But he acquired a people for himself from those who previously were
not a people: "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation."202
- One becomes a member of this people not by a physical birth, but by
being "born anew," a birth "of water and the Spirit,"203 that is, by
faith in Christ, and Baptism.
- This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the
Messiah). Because the same anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from the
head into the body, this is "the messianic people."
- "The status of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the
sons of God, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple."
- "Its law is the new commandment to love as Christ loved us."204
This is the "new" law of the Holy Spirit.205
- Its mission is to be salt of the earth and light of the world.206 This
people is "a most sure seed of unity, hope, and salvation for the whole
human race."
-Its destiny, finally, "is the Kingdom of God which has been begun by
God himself on earth and which must be further extended until it has
been brought to perfection by him at the end of time."207
A priestly, prophetic, and royal people
783 Jesus Christ is the one whom the Father anointed with the Holy
Spirit and established as priest, prophet, and king. the whole People of
God participates in these three offices of Christ and bears the
responsibilities for mission and service that flow from them.208
784 On entering the People of God through faith and Baptism, one
receives a share in this people's unique, priestly vocation: "Christ the
Lord, high priest taken from among men, has made this new people 'a
kingdom of priests to God, his Father.' the baptized, by regeneration
and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated to be a spiritual
house and a holy priesthood."209
785 "The holy People of God shares also in Christ's prophetic office,"
above all in the supernatural sense of faith that belongs to the whole
People, lay and clergy, when it "unfailingly adheres to this faith . . .
once for all delivered to the saints,"210 and when it deepens its
understanding and becomes Christ's witness in the midst of this world.
786 Finally, the People of God shares in the royal office of Christ. He
exercises his kingship by drawing all men to himself through his death
and Resurrection.211 Christ, King and Lord of the universe, made
himself the servant of all, for he came "not to be served but to serve,
and to give his life as a ransom for many."212 For the Christian, "to
reign is to serve him," particularly when serving "the poor and the
suffering, in whom the Church recognizes the image of her poor and
suffering founder."213 The People of God fulfills its royal dignity by a
life in keeping with its vocation to serve with Christ.
The sign of the cross makes kings of all those reborn in Christ and the
anointing of the Holy Spirit consecrates them as priests, so that, apart
from the particular service of our ministry, all spiritual and rational
Christians are recognized as members of this royal race and sharers in
Christ's priestly office. What, indeed, is as royal for a soul as to govern
the body in obedience to God? and what is as priestly as to dedicate a
pure conscience to the Lord and to offer the spotless offerings of
devotion on the altar of the heart?214
II. THE CHURCH - BODY OF CHRIST
The Church is communion with Jesus
787 From the beginning, Jesus associated his disciples with his own
life, revealed the mystery of the Kingdom to them, and gave them a
share in his mission, joy, and sufferings.215 Jesus spoke of a still more
intimate communion between him and those who would follow him:
"Abide in me, and I in you.... I am the vine, you are the branches."216
and he proclaimed a mysterious and real communion between his own
body and ours: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in
me, and I in him."217
788 When his visible presence was taken from them, Jesus did not leave
his disciples orphans. He promised to remain with them until the end
of time; he sent them his Spirit.218 As a result communion with Jesus
has become, in a way, more intense: "By communicating his Spirit,
Christ mystically constitutes as his body those brothers of his who are
called together from every nation."219
789 The comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the
intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she
gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects
of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted:
the unity of all her members with each other as a result of their union
with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church as bride of
Christ.
"One Body"
790 Believers who respond to God's word and become members of
Christ's Body, become intimately united with him: "In that body the
life of Christ is communicated to those who believe, and who, through
the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ in his
Passion and glorification."220 This is especially true of Baptism, which
unites us to Christ's death and Resurrection, and the Eucharist, by
which "really sharing in the body of the Lord, . . . we are taken up into
communion with him and with one another."221
791 The body's unity does not do away with the diversity of its
members: "In the building up of Christ's Body there is engaged a
diversity of members and functions. There is only one Spirit who,
according to his own richness and the needs of the ministries, gives his
different gifts for the welfare of the Church."222 The unity of the
Mystical Body produces and stimulates charity among the faithful:
"From this it follows that if one member suffers anything, all the
members suffer with him, and if one member is honored, all the
members together rejoice."223 Finally, the unity of the Mystical Body
triumphs over all human divisions: "For as many of you as were
baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female;
for you are all one in Christ Jesus."224
"Christ is the Head of this Body"
792 Christ "is the head of the body, the Church."225 He is the
principle of creation and redemption. Raised to the Father's glory, "in
everything he (is) preeminent,"226 especially in the Church, through
whom he extends his reign over all things.
793 Christ unites us with his Passover: all his members must strive to
resemble him, "until Christ be formed" in them.227 "For this reason
we . . . are taken up into the mysteries of his life, . . . associated with his
sufferings as the body with its head, suffering with him, that with him
we may be glorified."228
794 Christ provides for our growth: to make us grow toward him, our
head,229 he provides in his Body, the Church, the gifts and assistance
by which we help one another along the way of salvation.
795 Christ and his Church thus together make up the "whole Christ"
(Christus totus). the Church is one with Christ. the saints are acutely
aware of this unity:
Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only
Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren,
God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ.
For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the
whole man.... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the members.
But what does "head and members" mean? Christ and the Church.230
Our redeemer has shown himself to be one person with the holy
Church whom he has taken to himself.231
Head and members form as it were one and the same mystical
person.232
A reply of St. Joan of Arc to her judges sums up the faith of the holy
doctors and the good sense of the believer: "About Jesus Christ and the
Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't
complicate the matter."233
The Church is the Bride of Christ
796 The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of one
Body, also implies the distinction of the two within a personal
relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of bridegroom
and bride. the theme of Christ as Bridegroom of the Church was
prepared for by the prophets and announced by John the Baptist.234
The Lord referred to himself as the "bridegroom."235 The Apostle
speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful, members of his
Body, as a bride "betrothed" to Christ the Lord so as to become but
one spirit with him.236 The Church is the spotless bride of the spotless
Lamb.237 "Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that
he might sanctify her."238 He has joined her with himself in an
everlasting covenant and never stops caring for her as for his own
body:239
This is the whole Christ, head and body, one formed from many . . .
whether the head or members speak, it is Christ who speaks. He speaks
in his role as the head (ex persona capitis) and in his role as body (ex
persona corporis). What does this mean? "The two will become one
flesh. This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the
Church."240 and the Lord himself says in the Gospel: "So they are no
longer two, but one flesh."241 They are, in fact, two different persons,
yet they are one in the conjugal union, . . . as head, he calls himself the
bridegroom, as body, he calls himself "bride."242
III. THE CHURCH IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
797 "What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to the
Body of Christ, which is the Church."243 "To this Spirit of Christ, as
an invisible principle, is to be ascribed the fact that all the parts of the
body are joined one with the other and with their exalted head; for the
whole Spirit of Christ is in the head, the whole Spirit is in the body,
and the whole Spirit is in each of the members."244 The Holy Spirit
makes the Church "the temple of the living God":245
Indeed, it is to the Church herself that the "Gift of God" has been
entrusted.... In it is in her that communion with Christ has been
deposited, that is to say: the Holy Spirit, the pledge of incorruptibility,
the strengthening of our faith and the ladder of our ascent to God....
For where the Church is, there also is God's Spirit; where God's Spirit
is, there is the Church and every grace.246
798 The Holy Spirit is "the principle of every vital and truly saving
action in each part of the Body."247 He works in many ways to build
up the whole Body in charity:248 by God's Word "which is able to
build you up";249 by Baptism, through which he forms Christ's
Body;250 by the sacraments, which give growth and healing to Christ's
members; by "the grace of the apostles, which holds first place among
his gifts";251 by the virtues, which make us act according to what is
good; finally, by the many special graces (called "charisms"), by which
he makes the faithful "fit and ready to undertake various tasks and
offices for the renewal and building up of the Church."252
Charisms
799 Whether extraordinary or simple and humble, charisms are graces
of the Holy Spirit which directly or indirectly benefit the Church,
ordered as they are to her building up, to the good of men, and to the
needs of the world.
800 Charisms are to be accepted with gratitude by the person who
receives them and by all members of the Church as well. They are a
wonderfully rich grace for the apostolic vitality and for the holiness of
the entire Body of Christ, provided they really are genuine gifts of the
Holy Spirit and are used in full conformity with authentic promptings
of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping with charity, the true measure of
all charisms.253
801 It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always necessary.
No charism is exempt from being referred and submitted to the
Church's shepherds. "Their office (is) not indeed to extinguish the
Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is good,"254 so that
all the diverse and complementary charisms work together "for the
common good."255
IN BRIEF
802 Christ Jesus "gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity
and to purify for himself a people of his own" (Titus 2:14).
803 "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's
own people" (1 Pet 2:9).
804 One enters into the People of God by faith and Baptism. "All men
are called to belong to the new People of God" (LG 13), so that, in
Christ, "men may form one family and one People of God" (AG 1).
805 The Church is the Body of Christ. Through the Spirit and his
action in the sacraments, above all the Eucharist, Christ, who once was
dead and is now risen, establishes the community of believers as his
own Body.
806 In the unity of this Body, there is a diversity of members and
functions. All members are linked to one another, especially to those
who are suffering, to the poor and persecuted.
807 The Church is this Body of which Christ is the head: she lives
from him, in him, and for him; he lives with her and in her.
808 The Church is the Bride of Christ: he loved her and handed
himself over for her. He has purified her by his blood and made her the
fruitful mother of all God's children.
809 The Church is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. the Spirit is the soul,
as it were, of the Mystical Body, the source of its life, of its unity in
diversity, and of the riches of its gifts and charisms.
810 "Hence the universal Church is seen to be 'a people brought into
unity from the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit'" (LG
4 citing St. Cyprian, De Dom. orat. 23: PL 4, 553).

Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"




Paragraph 3. THE CHURCH IS ONE, HOLY, CATHOLIC, AND
APOSTOLIC
811 "This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess
to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic."256 These four characteristics,
inseparably linked with each other,257 indicate essential features of the
Church and her mission. the Church does not possess them of herself;
it is Christ who, through the Holy Spirit, makes his Church one, holy,
catholic, and apostolic, and it is he who calls her to realize each of
these qualities.
812 Only faith can recognize that the Church possesses these
properties from her divine source. But their historical manifestations
are signs that also speak clearly to human reason. As the First Vatican
Council noted, the "Church herself, with her marvellous propagation,
eminent holiness, and inexhaustible fruitfulness in everything good, her
catholic unity and invincible stability, is a great and perpetual motive of
credibility and an irrefutable witness of her divine mission."258
I. THE CHURCH IS ONE
"The sacred mystery of the Church's unity" (UR 2)
813 The Church is one because of her source: "the highest exemplar
and source of this mystery is the unity, in the Trinity of Persons, of one
God, the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit."259 The Church is
one because of her founder: for "the Word made flesh, the prince of
peace, reconciled all men to God by the cross, . . . restoring the unity
of all in one people and one body."260 The Church is one because of
her "soul": "It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and
pervading and ruling over the entire Church, who brings about that
wonderful communion of the faithful and joins them together so
intimately in Christ that he is the principle of the Church's unity."261
Unity is of the essence of the Church:
What an astonishing mystery! There is one Father of the universe, one
Logos of the universe, and also one Holy Spirit, everywhere one and
the same; there is also one virgin become mother, and I should like to
call her "Church."262
814 From the beginning, this one Church has been marked by a great
diversity which comes from both the variety of God's gifts and the
diversity of those who receive them. Within the unity of the People of
God, a multiplicity of peoples and cultures is gathered together.
Among the Church's members, there are different gifts, offices,
conditions, and ways of life. "Holding a rightful place in the
communion of the Church there are also particular Churches that
retain their own traditions."263 The great richness of such diversity is
not opposed to the Church's unity. Yet sin and the burden of its
consequences constantly threaten the gift of unity. and so the Apostle
has to exhort Christians to "maintain the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace."264
815 What are these bonds of unity? Above all, charity "binds everything
together in perfect harmony."265 But the unity of the pilgrim Church
is also assured by visible bonds of communion:
- profession of one faith received from the Apostles;
-common celebration of divine worship, especially of the sacraments;
- apostolic succession through the sacrament of Holy Orders,
maintaining the fraternal concord of God's family.266
816 "The sole Church of Christ [is that] which our Savior, after his
Resurrection, entrusted to Peter's pastoral care, commissioning him
and the other apostles to extend and rule it.... This Church,
constituted and organized as a society in the present world, subsists in
(subsistit in) in) the Catholic Church, which is governed by the
successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion with him."267
The Second Vatican Council's Decree on Ecumenism explains: "For it
is through Christ's Catholic Church alone, which is the universal help
toward salvation, that the fullness of the means of salvation can be
obtained. It was to the apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the
head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the
New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the one Body of Christ
into which all those should be fully incorporated who belong in any
way to the People of God."268
Wounds to unity
817 In fact, "in this one and only Church of God from its very
beginnings there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly
censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more serious
dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from
full communion with the Catholic Church - for which, often enough,
men of both sides were to blame."269 The ruptures that wound the
unity of Christ's Body - here we must distinguish heresy, apostasy, and
schism270 - do not occur without human sin:
Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, heresies, and
disputes. Where there is virtue, however, there also are harmony and
unity, from which arise the one heart and one soul of all believers.271
818 "However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those
who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from
such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and
the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as
brothers .... All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are
incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called
Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord
by the children of the Catholic Church."272
819 "Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth"273
are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: "the
written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and charity, with the
other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements."274
Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as
means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and
truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these
blessings come from Christ and lead to him,275 and are in themselves
calls to "Catholic unity."276
Toward unity
820 "Christ bestowed unity on his Church from the beginning. This
unity, we believe, subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can
never lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end
of time."277 Christ always gives his Church the gift of unity, but the
Church must always pray and work to maintain, reinforce, and perfect
the unity that Christ wills for her. This is why Jesus himself prayed at
the hour of his Passion, and does not cease praying to his Father, for
the unity of his disciples: "That they may all be one. As you, Father, are
in me and I am in you, may they also be one in us, . . . so that the
world may know that you have sent me."278 The desire to recover the
unity of all Christians is a gift of Christ and a call of the Holy
Spirit.279
821 Certain things are required in order to respond adequately to this
call:
- a permanent renewal of the Church in greater fidelity to her vocation;
such renewal is the driving-force of the movement toward unity;280
- conversion of heart as the faithful "try to live holier lives according to
the Gospel";281 for it is the unfaithfulness of the members to Christ's
gift which causes divisions;
- prayer in common, because "change of heart and holiness of life,
along with public and private prayer for the unity of Christians, should
be regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and merits
the name 'spiritual ecumenism;"'282
-fraternal knowledge of each other;283
- ecumenical formation of the faithful and especially of priests;284
- dialogue among theologians and meetings among Christians of the
different churches and communities;285
- collaboration among Christians in various areas of service to
mankind.286 "Human service" is the idiomatic phrase.
822 Concern for achieving unity "involves the whole Church, faithful
and clergy alike."287 But we must realize "that this holy objective - the
reconciliation of all Christians in the unity of the one and only Church
of Christ - transcends human powers and gifts." That is why we place
all our hope "in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in the love of the
Father for us, and in the power of the Holy Spirit."288
II THE CHURCH IS HOLY
823 "The Church . . . is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfailingly
holy. This is because Christ, the Son of God, who with the Father and
the Spirit is hailed as 'alone holy,' loved the Church as his Bride, giving
himself up for her so as to sanctify her; he joined her to himself as his
body and endowed her with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the glory of
God."289 The Church, then, is "the holy People of God,"290 and her
members are called "saints."291
824 United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him; through him
and with him she becomes sanctifying. "All the activities of the Church
are directed, as toward their end, to the sanctification of men in Christ
and the glorification of God."292 It is in the Church that "the fullness
of the means of salvation"293 has been deposited. It is in her that "by
the grace of God we acquire holiness."294
825 "The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is
real though imperfect."295 In her members perfect holiness is
something yet to be acquired: "Strengthened by so many and such
great means of salvation, all the faithful, whatever their condition or
state - though each in his own way - are called by the Lord to that
perfection of sanctity by which the Father himself is perfect."296
826 Charity is the soul of the holiness to which all are called: it
"governs, shapes, and perfects all the means of sanctification."297
If the Church was a body composed of different members, it couldn't
lack the noblest of all; it must have a Heart, and a Heart BURNING
WITH LOVE.
and I realized that this love alone was the true motive force which
enabled the other members of the Church to act; if it ceased to
function, the Apostles would forget to preach the gospel, the Martyrs
would refuse to shed their blood.
LOVE, IN FACT, IS THE VOCATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL
OTHERS; IT'S A UNIVERSE OF ITS OWN, COMPRISING ALL
TIME AND SPACE - IT'S ETERNAL!298
827 "Christ, 'holy, innocent, and undefiled,' knew nothing of sin, but
came only to expiate the sins of the people. the Church, however,
clasping sinners to her bosom, at once holy and always in need of
purification, follows constantly the path of penance and renewal."299
All members of the Church, including her ministers, must
acknowledge that they are sinners.300 In everyone, the weeds of sin
will still be mixed with the good wheat of the Gospel until the end of
time.301 Hence the Church gathers sinners already caught up in
Christ's salvation but still on the way to holiness:
The Church is therefore holy, though having sinners in her midst,
because she herself has no other life but the life of grace. If they live
her life, her members are sanctified; if they move away from her life,
they fall into sins and disorders that prevent the radiation of her
sanctity. This is why she suffers and does penance for those offenses, of
which she has the power to free her children through the blood of
Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit.302
828 By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solemnly pro claiming
that they practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to God's grace, the
Church recognizes the power of the Spirit of holiness within her and
sustains the hope of believers by proposing the saints to them as
models and intercessors.303 "The saints have always been the source
and origin of renewal in the most difficult moments in the Church's
history."304 Indeed, "holiness is the hidden source and infallible
measure of her apostolic activity and missionary zeal."305
829 "But while in the most Blessed Virgin the Church has already
reached that perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle, the
faithful still strive to conquer sin and increase in holiness. and so they
turn their eyes to Mary":306 in her, the Church is already the "all-
holy."
III. THE CHURCH IS CATHOLIC
What does "catholic" mean?
830 The word "catholic" means "universal," in the sense of "according
to the totality" or "in keeping with the whole." the Church is catholic in
a double sense: First, the Church is catholic because Christ is present
in her. "Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic Church."307
In her subsists the fullness of Christ's body united with its head; this
implies that she receives from him "the fullness of the means of
salvation"308 which he has willed: correct and complete confession of
faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in apostolic
succession. the Church was, in this fundamental sense, catholic on the
day of Pentecost309 and will always be so until the day of the Parousia.
831 Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent out by
Christ on a mission to the whole of the human race:310
All men are called to belong to the new People of God. This People,
therefore, while remaining one and only one, is to be spread
throughout the whole world and to all ages in order that the design of
God's will may be fulfilled: he made human nature one in the
beginning and has decreed that all his children who were scattered
should be finally gathered together as one.... the character of
universality which adorns the People of God is a gift from the Lord
himself whereby the Catholic Church ceaselessly and efficaciously
seeks for the return of all humanity and all its goods, under Christ the
Head in the unity of his Spirit.311
Each particular Church is "catholic"
832 "The Church of Christ is really present in all legitimately
organized local groups of the faithful, which, in so far as they are
united to their pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches in
the New Testament.... In them the faithful are gathered together
through the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, and the mystery of the
Lord's Supper is celebrated.... In these communities, though they may
often be small and poor, or existing in the diaspora, Christ is present,
through whose power and influence the One, Holy, Catholic, and
Apostolic Church is constituted."312
833 The phrase "particular church," which is first of all the diocese (or
eparchy), refers to a community of the Christian faithful in
communion of faith and sacraments with their bishop ordained in
apostolic succession.313 These particular Churches "are constituted
after the model of the universal Church; it is in these and formed out
of them that the one and unique Catholic Church exists."314
834 Particular Churches are fully catholic through their communion
with one of them, the Church of Rome "which presides in charity."315
"For with this church, by reason of its pre-eminence, the whole
Church, that is the faithful everywhere, must necessarily be in
accord."316 Indeed, "from the incarnate Word's descent to us, all
Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great Church
that is here [at Rome] to be their only basis and foundation since,
according to the Savior's promise, the gates of hell have never prevailed
against her."317
835 "Let us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church as
the simple sum, or . . . the more or less anomalous federation of
essentially different particular churches. In the mind of the Lord the
Church is universal by vocation and mission, but when she pub down
her roots in a variety of cultural, social, and human terrains, she takes
on different external expressions and appearances in each part of the
world."318 The rich variety of ecclesiastical disciplines, liturgical rites,
and theological and spiritual heritages proper to the local churches
"unified in a common effort, shows all the more resplendently the
catholicity of the undivided Church."319
Who belongs to the Catholic Church?
836 "All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of God....
and to it, in different ways, belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful,
others who believe in Christ, and finally all mankind, called by God's
grace to salvation."320
837 "Fully incorporated into the society of the Church are those who,
possessing the Spirit of Christ, accept all the means of salvation given
to the Church together with her entire organization, and who - by the
bonds constituted by the profession of faith, the sacraments,
ecclesiastical government, and communion - are joined in the visible
structure of the Church of Christ, who rules her through the Supreme
Pontiff and the bishops. Even though incorporated into the Church,
one who does not however persevere in charity is not saved. He
remains indeed in the bosom of the Church, but 'in body' not 'in
heart.'"321
838 "The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the
baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess
the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or
communion under the successor of Peter."322 Those "who believe in
Christ and have been properly baptized are put in a certain, although
imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church."323 With the
Orthodox Churches, this communion is so profound "that it lacks little
to attain the fullness that would permit a common celebration of the
Lord's Eucharist."324
The Church and non-Christians
839 "Those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the
People of God in various ways."325
The relationship of the Church with the Jewish People. When she
delves into her own mystery, the Church, the People of God in the
New Covenant, discovers her link with the Jewish People,326 "the first
to hear the Word of God."327 The Jewish faith, unlike other non-
Christian religions, is already a response to God's revelation in the Old
Covenant. To the Jews "belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants,
the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong
the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the
Christ",328 "for the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable."329
840 and when one considers the future, God's People of the Old
Covenant and the new People of God tend towards similar goals:
expectation of the coming (or the return) of the Messiah. But one
awaits the return of the Messiah who died and rose from the dead and
is recognized as Lord and Son of God; the other awaits the coming of a
Messiah, whose features remain hidden till the end of time; and the
latter waiting is accompanied by the drama of not knowing or of
misunderstanding Christ Jesus.
841 The Church's relationship with the Muslims. "The plan of
salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first
place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith
of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God,
mankind's judge on the last day."330
842 The Church's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first
place the common origin and end of the human race:
All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from
the one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also
because all share a common destiny, namely God. His providence,
evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day
when the elect are gathered together in the holy city. . .331
843 The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search,
among shadows and images, for the God who is unknown yet near
since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to be
saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in
these religions as "a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who
enlightens all men that they may at length have life."332
844 In their religious behavior, however, men also display the limits
and errors that disfigure the image of God in them:
Very often, deceived by the Evil One, men have become vain in their
reasonings, and have exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and served
the creature rather than the Creator. Or else, living and dying in this
world without God, they are exposed to ultimate despair.333
845 To reunite all his children, scattered and led astray by sin, the
Father willed to call the whole of humanity together into his Son's
Church. the Church is the place where humanity must rediscover its
unity and salvation. the Church is "the world reconciled." She is that
bark which "in the full sail of the Lord's cross, by the breath of the
Holy Spirit, navigates safely in this world." According to another image
dear to the Church Fathers, she is prefigured by Noah's ark, which
alone saves from the flood.334
"Outside the Church there is no salvation"
846 How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the
Church Fathers?335 Re-formulated positively, it means that all
salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his
Body:
Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the
Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one
Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in
his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the
necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time
the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as
through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the
Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ,
would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.336
847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of
their own, do not know Christ and his Church:
Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of
Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere
heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they
know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may
achieve eternal salvation.337
848 "Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who,
through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith
without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the
obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men."338
Mission - a requirement of the Church's catholicity
849 The missionary mandate. "Having been divinely sent to the
nations that she might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,' the
Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and because it is
demanded by her own essential universality, strives to preach the
Gospel to all men":339 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you;
and Lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age."340
850 The origin and purpose of mission. the Lord's missionary mandate
is ultimately grounded in the eternal love of the Most Holy Trinity:
"The Church on earth is by her nature missionary since, according to
the plan of the Father, she has as her origin the mission of the Son and
the Holy Spirit."341 The ultimate purpose of mission is none other
than to make men share in the communion between the Father and the
Son in their Spirit of love.342
851 Missionary motivation. It is from God's love for all men that the
Church in every age receives both the obligation and the vigor of her
missionary dynamism, "for the love of Christ urges us on."343 Indeed,
God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
truth";344 that is, God wills the salvation of everyone through the
knowledge of the truth. Salvation is found in the truth. Those who
obey the prompting of the Spirit of truth are already on the way of
salvation. But the Church, to whom this truth has been entrusted,
must go out to meet their desire, so as to bring them the truth.
Because she believes in God's universal plan of salvation, the Church
must be missionary.
852 Missionary paths. the Holy Spirit is the protagonist, "the principal
agent of the whole of the Church's mission."345 It is he who leads the
Church on her missionary paths. "This mission continues and, in the
course of history, unfolds the mission of Christ, who was sent to
evangelize the poor; so the Church, urged on by the Spirit of Christ,
must walk the road Christ himself walked, a way of poverty and
obedience, of service and self-sacrifice even to death, a death from
which he emerged victorious by his resurrection."346 So it is that "the
blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians."347
853 On her pilgrimage, the Church has also experienced the
"discrepancy existing between the message she proclaims and the
human weakness of those to whom the Gospel has been
entrusted."348 Only by taking the "way of penance and renewal," the
"narrow way of the cross," can the People of God extend Christ's
reign.349 For "just as Christ carried out the work of redemption in
poverty and oppression, so the Church is called to follow the same
path if she is to communicate the fruits of salvation to men."350
854 By her very mission, "the Church . . . travels the same journey as
all humanity and shares the same earthly lot with the world: she is to
be a leaven and, as it were, the soul of human society in its renewal by
Christ and transformation into the family of God."351 Missionary
endeavor requires patience. It begins with the proclamation of the
Gospel to peoples and groups who do not yet believe in Christ,352
continues with the establishment of Christian communities that are "a
sign of God's presence in the world,"353 and leads to the foundation of
local churches.354 It must involve a process of inculturation if the
Gospel is to take flesh in each people's culture.355 There will be times
of defeat. "With regard to individuals, groups, and peoples it is only by
degrees that [the Church] touches and penetrates them and so receives
them into a fullness which is Catholic."356
855 The Church's mission stimulates efforts towards Christian
unity.357 Indeed, "divisions among Christians prevent the Church
from realizing in practice the fullness of catholicity proper to her in
those of her sons who, though joined to her by Baptism, are yet
separated from full communion with her. Furthermore, the Church
herself finds it more difficult to express in actual life her full catholicity
in all its aspects."358
856 The missionary task implies a respectful dialogue with those who
do not yet accept the Gospel.359 Believers can profit from this
dialogue by learning to appreciate better "those elements of truth and
grace which are found among peoples, and which are, as it were, a
secret presence of God."360 They proclaim the Good News to those
who do not know it, in order to consolidate, complete, and raise up the
truth and the goodness that God has distributed among men and
nations, and to purify them from error and evil "for the glory of God,
the confusion of the demon, and the happiness of man."361
IV. THE CHURCH IS APOSTOLIC
857 The Church is apostolic because she is founded on the apostles, in
three ways:
- she was and remains built on "the foundation of the Apostles,"362
The witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ himself;363
- with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and
hands on the teaching,364 The "good deposit," the salutary words she
has heard from the apostles;365
- she continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles
until Christ's return, through their successors in pastoral office: the
college of bishops, "assisted by priests, in union with the successor of
Peter, the Church's supreme pastor":366
You are the eternal Shepherd
who never leaves his flock untended.
Through the apostles you watch over us and protect us always.
You made them shepherds of the flock
to share in the work of your Son....367
The Apostles' mission
858 Jesus is the Father's Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry,
he "called to him those whom he desired; .... and he appointed twelve,
whom also he named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to
preach."368 From then on, they would also be his "emissaries" (Greek
apostoloi). In them, Christ continues his own mission: "As the Father
has sent me, even so I send you."369 The apostles' ministry is the
continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: "he who receives
you receives me."370
859 Jesus unites them to the mission he received from the Father. As
"the Son can do nothing of his own accord," but receives everything
from the Father who sent him, so those whom Jesus sends can do
nothing apart from him,371 from whom they received both the
mandate for their mission and the power to carry it out. Christ's
apostles knew that they were called by God as "ministers of a new
covenant," "servants of God," "ambassadors for Christ," "servants of
Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."372
860 In the office of the apostles there is one aspect that cannot be
transmitted: to be the chosen witnesses of the Lord's Resurrection and
so the foundation stones of the Church. But their office also has a
permanent aspect. Christ promised to remain with them always. the
divine mission entrusted by Jesus to them "will continue to the end of
time, since the Gospel they handed on is the lasting source of all life
for the Church. Therefore, . . . the apostles took care to appoint
successors."373
The bishops - successors of the apostles
861 "In order that the mission entrusted to them might be continued
after their death, [the apostles] consigned, by will and testament, as it
were, to their immediate collaborators the duty of completing and
consolidating the work they had begun, urging them to tend to the
whole flock, in which the Holy Spirit had appointed them to shepherd
the Church of God. They accordingly designated such men and then
made the ruling that likewise on their death other proven men should
take over their ministry."374
862 "Just as the office which the Lord confided to Peter alone, as first
of the apostles, destined to be transmitted to his successors, is a
permanent one, so also endures the office, which the apostles received,
of shepherding the Church, a charge destined to be exercised without
interruption by the sacred order of bishops."375 Hence the Church
teaches that "the bishops have by divine institution taken the place of
the apostles as pastors of the Church, in such wise that whoever listens
to them is listening to Christ and whoever despises them despises
Christ and him who sent Christ."376
The apostolate
863 The whole Church is apostolic, in that she remains, through the
successors of St. Peter and the other apostles, in communion of faith
and life with her origin: and in that she is "sent out" into the whole
world. All members of the Church share in this mission, though in
various ways. "The Christian vocation is, of its nature, a vocation to the
apostolate as well." Indeed, we call an apostolate "every activity of the
Mystical Body" that aims "to spread the Kingdom of Christ over all the
earth."377
864 "Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church's whole
apostolate"; thus the fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained ministers as
well as for lay people clearly depends on their vital union with
Christ.378 In keeping with their vocations, the demands of the times
and the various gifts of the Holy Spirit, the apostolate assumes the
most varied forms. But charity, drawn from the Eucharist above all, is
always "as it were, the soul of the whole apostolate."379
865 The Church is ultimately one, holy, catholic, and apostolic in her
deepest and ultimate identity, because it is in her that "the Kingdom of
heaven," the "Reign of God,"380 already exists and will be fulfilled at
the end of time. the kingdom has come in the person of Christ and
grows mysteriously in the hearts of those incorporated into him, until
its full eschatological manifestation. Then all those he has redeemed
and made "holy and blameless before him in love,"381 will be gathered
together as the one People of God, the
"Bride of the Lamb,"382 "the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of
heaven from God, having the glory of God."383 For "the wall of the
city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb."384
IN BRIEF
866 The Church is one: she acknowledges one Lord, confesses one
faith, is born of one Baptism, forms only one Body, is given life by the
one Spirit, for the sake of one hope (cf Eph 4:3-5), at whose fulfillment
all divisions will be overcome.
867 The Church is holy: the Most Holy God is her author; Christ, her
bridegroom, gave himself up to make her holy; the Spirit of holiness
gives her life. Since she still includes sinners, she is "the sinless one
made up of sinners." Her holiness shines in the saints; in Mary she is
already all-holy.
868 The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She
bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salvation.
She is sent out to all peoples. She speaks to all men. She encompasses
all times. She is "missionary of her very nature" (AG 2).
869 The Church is apostolic. She is built on a lasting foundation: "the
twelve apostles of the Lamb" (Rev 21:14). She is indestructible (cf Mt
16:18). She is upheld infallibly in the truth: Christ governs her through
Peter and the other apostles, who are present in their successors, the
Pope and the college of bishops.
870 "The sole Church of Christ which in the Creed we profess to be
one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, . . . subsists in the Catholic Church,
which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in
communion with him. Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification
and of truth are found outside its visible confines"(LG 8).

SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT




Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"




Paragraph 4. CHRIST'S FAITHFUL - HIERARCHY, LAITY,
CONSECRATED LIFE
871 "The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been
incorporated in Christ through Baptism, have been constituted as the
people of God; for this reason, since they have become sharers in
Christ's priestly, prophetic, and royal office in their own manner, they
are called to exercise the mission which God has entrusted to the
Church to fulfill in the world, in accord with the condition proper to
each one."385
872 "In virtue of their rebirth in Christ there exists among all the
Christian faithful a true equality with regard to dignity and the activity
whereby all cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ in
accord with each one's own condition and function."386
873 The very differences which the Lord has willed to put between the
members of his body serve its unity and mission. For "in the Church
there is diversity of ministry but unity of mission. To the apostles and
their successors Christ has entrusted the office of teaching, sanctifying
and governing in his name and by his power. But the laity are made to
share in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly office of Christ; they have
therefore, in the Church and in the world, their own assignment in the
mission of the whole People of God."387 Finally, "from both groups
[hierarchy and laity] there exist Christian faithful who are consecrated
to God in their own special manner and serve the salvific mission of
the Church through the profession of the evangelical counsels."388
I. THE HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH
Why the ecclesial ministry?
874 Christ is himself the source of ministry in the Church. He
instituted the Church. He gave her authority and mission, orientation
and goal:
In order to shepherd the People of God and to increase its numbers
without cease, Christ the Lord set up in his Church a variety of offices
which aim at the good of the whole body. the holders of office, who are
invested with a sacred power, are, in fact, dedicated to promoting the
interests of their brethren, so that all who belong to the People of God
. . . may attain to salvation.389
875 "How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?
And how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can men
preach unless they are sent?"390 No one - no individual and no
community - can proclaim the Gospel to himself: "Faith comes from
what is heard."391 No one can give himself the mandate and the
mission to proclaim the Gospel. The one sent by the Lord does not
speak and act on his own authority, but by virtue of Christ's authority;
not as a member of the community, but speaking to it in the name of
Christ. No one can bestow grace on himself; it must be given and
offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and
empowered by Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the
mission and faculty ("the sacred power") to act in persona Christi
Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the people of God in the
diaconia of liturgy, word and charity, in communion with the bishop
and his presbyterate. The ministry in which Christ's emissaries do and
give by God's grace what they cannot do and give by their own powers,
is called a "sacrament" by the Church's tradition. Indeed, the ministry
of the Church is conferred by a special sacrament.
876 Intrinsically linked to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry
is its character as service. Entirely dependent on Christ who gives
mission and authority, ministers are truly "slaves of Christ,"392 in the
image of him who freely took "the form of a slave" for us.393 Because
the word and grace of which they are ministers are not their own, but
are given to them by Christ for the sake of others, they must freely
become the slaves of all.394
877 Likewise, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry
that it have a collegial character. In fact, from the beginning of his
ministry, the Lord Jesus instituted the Twelve as "the seeds of the new
Israel and the beginning of the sacred hierarchy."395 Chosen together,
they were also sent out together, and their fraternal unity would be at
the service of the fraternal communion of all the faithful: they would
reflect and witness to the communion of the divine persons.396 For
this reason every bishop exercises his ministry from within the
episcopal college, in communion with the bishop of Rome, the
successor of St. Peter and head of the college. So also priests exercise
their ministry from within the presbyterium of the diocese, under the
direction of their bishop.
878 Finally, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry
that it have a personal character. Although Chnst's ministers act in
communion with one another, they also always act in a personal way.
Each one is called personally: "You, follow me"397 in order to be a
personal witness within the common mission, to bear personal
responsibility before him who gives the mission, acting "in his person"
and for other persons: "I baptize you in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit ..."; "I absolve you...."
879 Sacramental ministry in the Church, then, is a service exercised in
the name of Christ. It has a personal character and a collegial form.
This is evidenced by the bonds between the episcopal college and its
head, the successor of St. Peter, and in the relationship between the
bishop's pastoral responsibility for his particular church and the
common solicitude of the episcopal college for the universal Church.
The episcopal college and its head, the Pope
880 When Christ instituted the Twelve, "he constituted [them] in the
form of a college or permanent assembly, at the head of which he
placed Peter, chosen from among them."398 Just as "by the Lord's
institution, St. Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single
apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter's
successor, and the bishops, the successors of the apostles, are related
with and united to one another."399
881 The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of
his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him
shepherd of the whole flock.400 "The office of binding and loosing
which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles
united to its head."401 This pastoral office of Peter and the other
apostles belongs to the Church's very foundation and is continued by
the bishops under the primacy of the Pope.
882 The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter's successor, "is the perpetual
and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and
of the whole company of the faithful."402 "For the Roman Pontiff, by
reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire
Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church,
a power which he can always exercise unhindered."403
883 "The college or body of bishops has no authority unless united
with the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, as its head." As such, this
college has "supreme and full authority over the universal Church; but
this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman
Pontiff."404
884 "The college of bishops exercises power over the universal Church
in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council."405 But "there never is
an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at least recognized as
such by Peter's successor."406
885 "This college, in so far as it is composed of many members, is the
expression of the variety and universality of the People of God; and of
the unity of the flock of Christ, in so far as it is assembled under one
head."407
886 "The individual bishops are the visible source and foundation of
unity in their own particular Churches."408 As such, they "exercise
their pastoral office over the portion of the People of God assigned to
them,"409 assisted by priests and deacons. But, as a member of the
episcopal college, each bishop shares in the concern for all the
Churches.410 The bishops exercise this care first "by ruling well their
own Churches as portions of the universal Church," and so
contributing "to the welfare of the whole Mystical Body, which, from
another point of view, is a corporate body of Churches."411 They
extend it especially to the poor,412 to those persecuted for the faith, as
well as to missionaries who are working throughout the world.
887 Neighboring particular Churches who share the same culture form
ecclesiastical provinces or larger groupings called patriarchates or
regions.413 The bishops of these groupings can meet in synods or
provincial councils. "In a like fashion, the episcopal conferences at the
present time are in a position to contribute in many and fruitful ways
to the concrete realization of the collegiate spirit."414
The teaching office
888 Bishops, with priests as co-workers, have as their first task "to
preach the Gospel of God to all men," in keeping with the Lord's
command.415 They are "heralds of faith, who draw new disciples to
Christ; they are authentic teachers" of the apostolic faith "endowed
with the authority of Christ."416
889 In order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed
on by the apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer on her a
share in his own infallibility. By a "supernatural sense of faith" the
People of God, under the guidance of the Church's living Magisterium,
"unfailingly adheres to this faith."417
890 The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive nature
of the covenant established by God with his people in Christ. It is this
Magisterium's task to preserve God's people from deviations and
defections and to guarantee them the objective possibility of professing
the true faith without error. Thus, the pastoral duty of the Magisterium
is aimed at seeing to it that the People of God abides in the truth that
liberates. To fulfill this service, Christ endowed the Church's shepherds
with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals. the
exercise of this charism takes several forms:
891 "The Roman Pontiff, head of the college of bishops, enjoys this
infallibility in virtue of his office, when, as supreme pastor and teacher
of all the faithful - who confirms his brethren in the faith he proclaims
by a definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or morals.... the
infallibility promised to the Church is also present in the body of
bishops when, together with Peter's successor, they exercise the
supreme Magisterium," above all in an Ecumenical Council.418 When
the Church through its supreme Magisterium proposes a doctrine "for
belief as being divinely revealed,"419 and as the teaching of Christ, the
definitions "must be adhered to with the obedience of faith."420 This
infallibility extends as far as the deposit of divine Revelation itself.421
892 Divine assistance is also given to the successors of the apostles,
teaching in communion with the successor of Peter, and, in a
particular way, to the bishop of Rome, pastor of the whole Church,
when, without arriving at an infallible definition and without
pronouncing in a "definitive manner," they propose in the exercise of
the ordinary Magisterium a teaching that leads to better understanding
of Revelation in matters of faith and morals. To this ordinary teaching
the faithful "are to adhere to it with religious assent"422 which, though
distinct from the assent of faith, is nonetheless an extension of it.
The sanctifying office
893 The bishop is "the steward of the grace of the supreme
priesthood,"423 especially in the Eucharist which he offers personally
or whose offering he assures through the priests, his co-workers. the
Eucharist is the center of the life of the particular Church. the bishop
and priests sanctify the Church by their prayer and work, by their
ministry of the word and of the sacraments. They sanctify her by their
example, "not as domineering over those in your charge but being
examples to the flock."424 Thus, "together with the flock entrusted to
them, they may attain to eternal life."425
The governing office
894 "The bishops, as vicars and legates of Christ, govern the particular
Churches assigned to them by their counsels, exhortations, and
example, but over and above that also by the authority and sacred
power" which indeed they ought to exercise so as to edify, in the spirit
of service which is that of their Master.426
895 "The power which they exercise personally in the name of Christ,
is proper, ordinary, and immediate, although its exercise is ultimately
controlled by the supreme authority of the Church."427 But the
bishops should not be thought of as vicars of the Pope. His ordinary
and immediate authority over the whole Church does not annul, but
on the contrary confirms and defends that of the bishops. Their
authority must be exercised in communion with the whole Church
under the guidance of the Pope.
896 The Good Shepherd ought to be the model and "form" of the
bishop's pastoral office. Conscious of his own weaknesses, "the bishop .
. . can have compassion for those who are ignorant and erring. He
should not refuse to listen to his subjects whose welfare he promotes as
of his very own children.... the faithful ... should be closely attached to
the bishop as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to
the Father":428
Let all follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ follows his Father, and the
college of presbyters as the apostles; respect the deacons as you do
God's law. Let no one do anything concerning the Church in
separation from the bishop.429
II. THE LAY FAITHFUL
897 "The term 'laity' is here understood to mean all the faithful except
those in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious state
approved by the Church. That is, the faithful, who by Baptism are
incorporated into Christ and integrated into the People of God, are
made sharers in their particular way in the priestly, prophetic, and
kingly office of Christ, and have their own part to play in the mission
of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the World."430
The vocation of lay people
898 "By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek
the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing
them according to God's will.... It pertains to them in a special way so
to illuminate and order all temporal things with which they are closely
associated that these may always be effected and grow according to
Christ and maybe to the glory of the Creator and Redeemer."431
899 The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially when the
matter involves discovering or inventing the means for permeating
social, political, and economic realities with the demands of Christian
doctrine and life. This initiative is a normal element of the life of the
Church:
Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church
is the animating principle of human society. Therefore, they in
particular ought to have an ever-clearer consciousness not only of
belonging to the Church, but of being the Church, that is to say, the
community of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope,
the common Head, and of the bishops in communion with him. They
are the Church.432
900 Since, like all the faithful, lay Christians are entrusted by God with
the apostolate by virtue of their Baptism and Confirmation, they have
the right and duty, individually or grouped in associations, to work so
that the divine message of salvation may be known and accepted by all
men throughout the earth. This duty is the more pressing when it is
only through them that men can hear the Gospel and know Christ.
Their activity in ecclesial communities is so necessary that, for the
most part, the apostolate of the pastors cannot be fully effective
without it.433
The participation of lay people in Christ's priestly office
901 "Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and anointed by
the Holy Spirit, are marvellously called and prepared so that even
richer fruits of the Spirit maybe produced in them. For all their works,
prayers, and apostolic undertakings, family and married life, daily
work, relaxation of mind and body, if they are accomplished in the
Spirit - indeed even the hardships of life if patiently born - all these
become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. In
the celebration of the Eucharist these may most fittingly be offered to
the Father along with the body of the Lord. and so, worshipping
everywhere by their holy actions, the laity consecrate the world itself to
God, everywhere offering worship by the holiness of their lives."434
902 In a very special way, parents share in the office of sanctifying "by
leading a conjugal life in the Christian spirit and by seeing to the
Christian education of their children."435
903 Lay people who possess the required qualities can be admitted
permanently to the ministries of lector and acolyte.436 When the
necessity of the Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking, lay
persons, even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for
certain of their offices, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to
preside over liturgical prayers, to confer Baptism, and to distribute
Holy Communion in accord with the prescriptions of law."437
Participation in Christ's prophetic office
904 "Christ . . . fulfills this prophetic office, not only by the hierarchy .
. . but also by the laity. He accordingly both establishes them as
witnesses and provides them with the sense of the faith [sensus fidei]
and the grace of the word"438
To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every preacher
and of each believer.439
905 Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization,
"that is, the proclamation of Christ by word and the testimony of life."
For lay people, "this evangelization . . . acquires a specific property and
peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary
circumstances of the world."440
This witness of life, however, is not the sole element in the apostolate;
the true apostle is on the lookout for occasions of announcing Christ
by word, either to unbelievers . . . or to the faithful.441
906 Lay people who are capable and trained may also collaborate in
catechetical formation, in teaching the sacred sciences, and in use of
the communications media.442
907 "In accord with the knowledge, competence, and preeminence
which they possess, [lay people] have the right and even at times a duty
to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which
pertain to the good of the Church, and they have a right to make their
opinion known to the other Christian faithful, with due regard to the
integrity of faith and morals and reverence toward their pastors, and
with consideration for the common good and the dignity of
persons."443
Participation in Christ's kingly office
908 By his obedience unto death,444 Christ communicated to his
disciples the gift of royal freedom, so that they might "by the self-
abnegation of a holy life, overcome the reign of sin in themselves":445
That man is rightly called a king who makes his own body an obedient
subject and, by governing himself with suitable rigor, refuses to let his
passions breed rebellion in his soul, for he exercises a kind of royal
power over himself. and because he knows how to rule his own person
as king, so too does he sit as its judge. He will not let himself be
imprisoned by sin, or thrown headlong into wickedness.446
909 "Moreover, by uniting their forces let the laity so remedy the
institutions and conditions of the world when the latter are an
inducement to sin, that these may be conformed to the norms of
justice, favoring rather than hindering the practice of virtue. By so
doing they will impregnate culture and human works with a moral
value."447
910 "The laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to cooperate
with their pastors in the service of the ecclesial community, for the sake
of its growth and life. This can be done through the exercise of
different kinds of ministries according to the grace and charisms which
the Lord has been pleased to bestow on them."448
911 In the Church, "lay members of the Christian faithful can
cooperate in the exercise of this power [of governance] in accord with
the norm of law."449 And so the Church provides for their presence at
particular councils, diocesan synods, pastoral councils; the exercise of
the pastoral care of a parish, collaboration in finance committees, and
participation in ecclesiastical tribunals, etc.450
912 The faithful should "distinguish carefully between the rights and
the duties which they have as belonging to the Church and those which
fall to them as members of the human society. They will strive to unite
the two harmoniously, remembering that in every temporal affair they
are to be guided by a Christian conscience, since no human activity,
even of the temporal order, can be withdrawn from God's
dominion."451
913 "Thus, every person, through these gifts given to him, is at once
the witness and the living instrument of the mission of the Church
itself 'according to the measure of Christ's bestowal."'452
III. THE CONSECRATED LIFE
914 "The state of life which is constituted by the profession of the
evangelical counsels, while not entering into the hierarchical structure
of the Church, belongs undeniably to her life and holiness."453
Evangelical counsels, consecrated life
915 Christ proposes the evangelical counsels, in their great variety, to
every disciple. the perfection of charity, to which all the faithful are
called, entails for those who freely follow the call to consecrated life the
obligation of practicing chastity in celibacy for the sake of the
Kingdom, poverty and obedience. It is the profession of these counsels,
within a permanent state of life recognized by the Church, that
characterizes the life consecrated to God.454
916 The state of consecrated life is thus one way of experiencing a
"more intimate" consecration, rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally
to God.455 In the consecrated life, Christ's faithful, moved by the
Holy Spirit, propose to follow Christ more nearly, to give themselves to
God who is loved above all and, pursuing the perfection of charity in
the service of the Kingdom, to signify and proclaim in the Church the
glory of the world to come.456
One great tree, with many branches
917 "From the God-given seed of the counsels a wonderful and wide-
spreading tree has grown up in the field of the Lord, branching out
into various forms of the religious life lived in solitude or in
community. Different religious families have come into existence in
which spiritual resources are multiplied for the progress in holiness of
their members and for the good of the entire Body of Christ."457
918 From the very beginning of the Church there were men and
women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate
him more closely, by practicing the evangelical counsels. They led lives
dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious
families. These the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted
and approved.458
919 Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life
granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of
consecrated life is reserved to the Apostolic See.459
The eremitic life
920 Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly,
hermits "devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the
world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of
solitude and assiduous prayer and penance."460
921 They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the
Church, that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes
of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom
he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him.
Here is a particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual
battle, the glory of the Crucified One.
Consecrated virgins
922 From apostolic times Christian virgins."460B and widows."460T,
called by the Lord to cling only to him with greater freedom of heart,
body, and spirit, have decided with the Church's approval to live in a
state of virginity "for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven."461
923 "Virgins who, committed to the holy plan of following Christ more
closely, are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop according to
the approved liturgical rite, are betrothed mystically to Christ, the Son
of God, and are dedicated to the service of the Church."462 By this
solemn rite (Consecratio virginum), the virgin is "constituted . . . a
sacred person, a transcendent sign of the Church's love for Christ, and
an eschatological image of this heavenly Bride of Christ and of the life
to come."463
924 "As with other forms of consecrated life," the order of virgins
establishes the woman living in the world (or the nun) in prayer,
penance, service of her brethren, and apostolic activity, according to
the state of life and spiritual gifts given to her.464 Consecrated virgins
can form themselves into associations to observe their commitment
more faithfully.465
Religious life
925 Religious life was born in the East during the first centuries of
Christianity. Lived within institutes canonically erected by the Church,
it is distinguished from other forms of consecrated life by its liturgical
character, public profession of the evangelical counsels, fraternal life
led in common, and witness given to the union of Christ with the
Church.466
926 Religious life derives from the mystery of the Church. It is a gift
she has received from her Lord, a gift she offers as a stable way of life
to the faithful called by God to profess the counsels. Thus, the Church
can both show forth Christ and acknowledge herself to be the Savior's
bride. Religious life in its various forms is called to signify the very
charity of God in the language of our time.
927 All religious, whether exempt or not, take their place among the
collaborators of the diocesan bishop in his pastoral duty.467 From the
outset of the work of evangelization, the missionary "planting" and
expansion of the Church require the presence of the religious life in all
its forms.468 "History witnesses to the outstanding service rendered
by religious families in the propagation of the faith and in the
formation of new Churches: from the ancient monastic institutions to
the medieval orders, all the way to the more recent congregations."469
Secular institutes
928 "A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the
Christian faithful living in the world strive for the perfection of charity
and work for the sanctification of the world especially from within."470
929 By a "life perfectly and entirely consecrated to [such]
sanctification," the members of these institutes share in the Church's
task of evangelization, "in the world and from within the world," where
their presence acts as "leaven in the world."471 "Their witness of a
Christian life" aims "to order temporal things according to God and
inform the world with the power of the gospel." They commit
themselves to the evangelical counsels by sacred bonds and observe
among themselves the communion and fellowship appropriate to their
"particular secular way of life."472
Societies of apostolic life
930 Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are "societies of
apostolic life whose members without religious vows pursue the
particular apostolic purpose of their society, and lead a life as brothers
or sisters in common according to a particular manner of life, strive for
the perfection of charity through the observance of the constitutions.
Among these there are societies in which the members embrace the
evangelical counsels" according to their constitutions.473
Consecration and mission: proclaiming the King who is corning
931 Already dedicated to him through Baptism, the person who
surrenders himself to the God he loves above all else thereby
consecrates himself more intimately to God's service and to the good
of the Church. By this state of life consecrated to God, the Church
manifests Christ and shows us how the Holy Spirit acts so wonderfully
in her. and so the first mission of those who profess the evangelical
counsels is to live out their consecration. Moreover, "since members of
institutes of consecrated life dedicate themselves through their
consecration to the service of the Church they are obliged in a special
manner to engage in missionary work, in accord with the character of
the institute."474
932 In the Church, which is like the sacrament - the sign and
instrument - of God's own life, the consecrated life is seen as a special
sign of the mystery of redemption. To follow and imitate Christ more
nearly and to manifest more clearly his self-emptying is to be more
deeply present to one's contemporaries, in the heart of Christ. For
those who are on this "narrower" path encourage their brethren by
their example, and bear striking witness "that the world cannot be
transfigured and offered to God without the spirit of the
beatitudes."475
933 Whether their witness is public, as in the religious state, or less
public, or even secret, Christ's coming remains for all those
consecrated both the origin and rising sun of their life:
For the People of God has here no lasting city, . . . [and this state]
reveals more clearly to all believers the heavenly goods which are
already present in this age, witnessing to the new and eternal life which
we have acquired through the redemptive work of Christ and preluding
our future resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom.476
IN BRIEF
934 "Among the Christian faithful by divine institution there exist in
the Church sacred ministers, who are also called clerics in law, and
other Christian faithful who are also called laity." In both groups there
are those Christian faithful who, professing the evangelical counsels,
are consecrated to God and so serve the Church's saving mission (cf.
CIC, can. 207 # 1, 2).
935 To proclaim the faith and to plant his reign, Christ sends his
apostles and their successors. He gives them a share in his own
mission. From him they receive the power to act in his person.
936 The Lord made St. Peter the visible foundation of his Church. He
entrusted the keys of the Church to him. the bishop of the Church of
Rome, successor to St. Peter, is "head of the college of bishops, the
Vicar of Christ and Pastor of the universal Church on earth" (CIC,
can. 331).
937 The Pope enjoys, by divine institution, "supreme, full, immediate,
and universal power in the care of souls" (CD 2).
938 The Bishops, established by the Holy Spirit, succeed the apostles.
They are "the visible source and foundation of unity in their own
particular Churches" (LG 23).
939 Helped by the priests, their co-workers, and by the deacons, the
bishops have the duty of authentically teaching the faith, celebrating
divine worship, above all the Eucharist, and guiding their Churches as
true pastors. Their responsibility also includes concern for all the
Churches, with and under the Pope.
940 "The characteristic of the lay state being a life led in the midst of
the world and of secular affairs, lay people are called by God to make
of their apostolate, through the vigor of their Christian spirit, a leaven
in the world" (AA 2 # 2).
941 Lay people share in Christ's priesthood: ever more united with
him, they exhibit the grace of Baptism and Confirmation in all
dimensions of their personal family, social and ecclesial lives, and so
fulfill the call to holiness addressed to all the baptized.
942 By virtue of their prophetic mission, lay people "are called . . . to
be witnesses to Christ in all circumstances and at the very heart of the
community of mankind" (GS 43 # 4).
943 By virtue of their kingly mission, lay people have the power to
uproot the rule of sin within themselves and in the world, by their self-
denial and holiness of life (cf. LG 36).
944 The life consecrated to God is characterized by the public
profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and
obedience, in a stable state of life recognized by the Church.
945 Already destined for him through Baptism, the person who
surrenders himself to the God he loves above all else thereby
consecrates himself more intimately to God's service and to the good
of the whole Church.

PART ONE: THE PROFESSION OF FAITH




SECTION TWO I. THE CREEDS




CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT




Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"




Paragraph 5. THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS
946 After confessing "the holy catholic Church," the Apostles' Creed
adds "the communion of saints." In a certain sense this article is a
further explanation of the preceding: "What is the Church if not the
assembly of all the saints?"477 The communion of saints is the
Church.
947 "Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is
communicated to the others.... We must therefore believe that there
exists a communion of goods in the Church. But the most important
member is Christ, since he is the head.... Therefore, the riches of
Christ are communicated to all the members, through the
sacraments."478 "As this Church is governed by one and the same
Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common
fund."479
948 The term "communion of saints" therefore has two closely linked
meanings: communion in holy things (sancta)" and "among holy
persons (sancti).
"Sancta sancti's! ("God's holy gifts for God's holy people") is
proclaimed by the celebrant in most Eastern liturgies during the
elevation of the holy Gifts before the distribution of communion. the
faithful (sancta) are fed by Christ's holy body and blood (sancta) to
grow in the communion of the Holy Spirit (koinonia) and to
communicate it to the world.
I. COMMUNION IN SPIRITUAL GOODS
949 In the primitive community of Jerusalem, the disciples "devoted
themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of
the bread and the prayers."480
Communion in the faith. the faith of the faithful is the faith of the
Church, received from the apostles. Faith is a treasure of life which is
enriched by being shared.
950 Communion of the sacraments. "The fruit of all the sacraments
belongs to all the faithful. All the sacraments are sacred links uniting
the faithful with one another and binding them to Jesus Christ, and
above all Baptism, the gate by which we enter into the Church. the
communion of saints must be understood as the communion of the
sacraments.... the name 'communion' can be applied to all of them, for
they unite us to God.... But this name is better suited to the Eucharist
than to any other, because it is primarily the Eucharist that brings this
communion about."481
951 Communion of charisms. Within the communion of the Church,
the Holy Spirit "distributes special graces among the faithful of every
rank" for the building up of the Church.482 Now, "to each is given the
manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."483
952 "They had everything in common."484 "Everything the true
Christian has is to be regarded as a good possessed in common with
everyone else. All Christians should be ready and eager to come to the
help of the needy . . . and of their neighbors in want."485 A Christian
is a steward of the Lord's goods.486
953 Communion in charity. In the sanctorum communio, "None of us
lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself."487 "If one member
suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice
together. Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of
it."488 "Charity does not insist on its own way."489 In this solidarity
with all men, living or dead, which is founded on the communion of
saints, the least of our acts done in charity redounds to the profit of all.
Every sin harms this communion.
II. THE COMMUNION OF THE CHURCH OF HEAVEN AND
EARTH
954 The three states of the Church. "When the Lord comes in glory,
and all his angels with him, death will be no more and all things will be
subject to him. But at the present time some of his disciples are
pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being purified, while still
others are in glory, contemplating 'in full light, God himself triune and
one, exactly as he is"':490
All of us, however, in varying degrees and in different ways share in the
same charity towards God and our neighbours, and we all sing the one
hymn of glory to our God. All, indeed, who are of Christ and who have
his Spirit form one Church and in Christ cleave together.491
955 "So it is that the union of the wayfarers with the brethren who
sleep in the peace of Christ is in no way interrupted, but on the
contrary, according to the constant faith of the Church, this union is
reinforced by an exchange of spiritual goods."492
956 The intercession of the saints. "Being more closely united to
Christ, those who dwell in heaven fix the whole Church more firmly in
holiness.... They do not cease to intercede with the Father for us, as
they proffer the merits which they acquired on earth through the one
mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus.... So by their fraternal
concern is our weakness greatly helped."493
Do not weep, for I shall be more useful to you after my death and I
shall help you then more effectively than during my life.494


I want to spend my heaven in doing good on earth.495
957 Communion with the saints. "It is not merely by the title of
example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek,
rather, that by this devotion to the exercise of fraternal charity the
union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened. Exactly
as Christian communion among our fellow pilgrims brings us closer to
Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to Christ, from
whom as from its fountain and head issues all grace, and the life of the
People of God itself"496:
We worship Christ as God's Son; we love the martyró as the Lord's
disciples and imitators, and rightly so because of their matchless
devotion towards their king and master. May we also be their
companions and fellow disciples!497
958 Communion with the dead. "In full consciousness of this
communion of the whole Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, the Church in
its pilgrim members, from the very earliest days of the Christian
religion, has honored with great respect the memory of the dead; and
'because it is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that
they may be loosed from their sins' she offers her suffrages for
them."498 Our prayer for them is capable not only of helping them,
but also of making their intercession for us effective.
959 In the one family of God. "For if we continue to love one another
and to join in praising the Most Holy Trinity - all of us who are sons of
God and form one family in Christ - we will be faithful to the deepest
vocation of the Church."499
IN BRIEF
960 The Church is a "communion of saints": this expression refers first
to the "holy things" (sancta), above all the Eucharist, by which "the
unity of believers, who form one body in Christ, is both represented
and brought about" (LG 3).
961 The term "communion of saints" refers also to the communion of
"holy persons" (sancti) in Christ who "died for all," so that what each
one does or suffers in and for Christ bears fruit for all.
962 "We believe in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those
who are pilgrims on earth, the dead who are being purified, and the
blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church; and we believe
that in this communion, the merciful love of God and his saints is
always [attentive] to our prayers" (Paul VI, CPG # 30).

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT




Article 9 "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH"
Paragraph 6. MARY - MOTHER OF CHRIST, MOTHER OF THE
CHURCH
963 Since the Virgin Mary's role in the mystery of Christ and the Spirit
has been treated, it is fitting now to consider her place in the mystery
of the Church. "The Virgin Mary . . . is acknowledged and honored as
being truly the Mother of God and of the redeemer.... She is 'clearly
the mother of the members of Christ' ... since she has by her charity
joined in bringing about the birth of believers in the Church, who are
members of its head."500 "Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the
Church."501
I. MARY'S MOTHERHOOD WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH
Wholly united with her Son . . .
964 Mary's role in the Church is inseparable from her union with
Christ and flows directly from it. "This union of the mother with the
Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's
virginal conception up to his death";502 it is made manifest above all
at the hour of his Passion:
Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and
faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross. There
she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, enduring with her only
begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, joining herself with his
sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the
immolation of this victim, born of her: to be given, by the same Christ
Jesus dying on the cross, as a mother to his disciple, with these words:
"Woman, behold your son."503
965 After her Son's Ascension, Mary "aided the beginnings of the
Church by her prayers."504 In her association with the apostles and
several women, "we also see Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of
the Spirit, who had already overshadowed her in the
Annunciation."505
. . . also in her Assumption
966 "Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of
original sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished, was taken
up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as
Queen over all things, so that she might be the more fully conformed
to her Son, the Lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death."506 The
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is a singular participation in her
Son's Resurrection and an anticipation of the resurrection of other
Christians:
In giving birth you kept your virginity; in your Dormition you did not
leave the world, O Mother of God, but were joined to the source of
Life. You conceived the living God and, by your prayers, will deliver
our souls from death.507
. . . she is our Mother in the order of grace
967 By her complete adherence to the Father's will, to his Son's
redemptive work, and to every prompting of the Holy Spirit, the Virgin
Mary is the Church's model of faith and charity. Thus she is a
"preeminent and . . . wholly unique member of the Church"; indeed,
she is the "exemplary realization" (typus)508 of the Church.
968 Her role in relation to the Church and to all humanity goes still
further. "In a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience,
faith, hope, and burning charity in the Savior's work of restoring
supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the
order of grace."509
969 "This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues
uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the
Annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the
cross, until the eternal fulfilment of all the elect. Taken up to heaven
she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession
continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation .... Therefore the
Blessed Virgin is invoked in the Church under the titles of Advocate,
Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix."510
970 "Mary's function as mother of men in no way obscures or
diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its power.
But the Blessed Virgin's salutary influence on men . . . flows forth from
the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on his mediation,
depends entirely on it, and draws all its power from it."511 "No
creature could ever be counted along with the Incarnate Word and
Redeemer; but just as the priesthood of Christ is shared in various
ways both by his ministers and the faithful, and as the one goodness of
God is radiated in different ways among his creatures, so also the
unique mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude but rather gives
rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one
source."512
II. DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN
971 "All generations will call me blessed": "The Church's devotion to
the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship."513 The Church
rightly honors "the Blessed Virgin with special devotion. From the
most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title
of 'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all their
dangers and needs.... This very special devotion ... differs essentially
from the adoration which is given to the incarnate Word and equally to
the Father and the Holy Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration."514
The liturgical feasts dedicated to the Mother of God and Marian
prayer, such as the rosary, an "epitome of the whole Gospel," express
this devotion to the Virgin Mary.515
III. MARY - ESCHATOLOGICAL ICON OF THE CHURCH
972 After speaking of the Church, her origin, mission, and destiny, we
can find no better way to conclude than by looking to Mary. In her we
contemplate what the Church already is in her mystery on her own
"pilgrimage of faith," and what she will be in the homeland at the end
of her journey. There, "in the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided
Trinity," "in the communion of all the saints,"516 The Church is
awaited by the one she venerates as Mother of her Lord and as her
own mother.
In the meantime the Mother of Jesus, in the glory which she possesses
in body and soul in heaven, is the image and beginning of the Church
as it is to be perfected in the world to come. Likewise she shines forth
on earth until the day of the Lord shall come, a sign of certain hope
and comfort to the pilgrim People of God.517
IN BRIEF
973 By pronouncing her "fiat" at the Annunciation and giving her
consent to the Incarnation, Mary was al ready collaborating with the
whole work her Son was to accomplish. She is mother wherever he is
Savior and head of the Mystical Body.
974 The Most Blessed Virgin Mary, when the course of her earthly life
was completed, was taken up body and soul into the glory of heaven,
where she already shares in the glory of her Son's Resurrection,
anticipating the resurrection of all members of his Body.
975 "We believe that the Holy Mother of God, the new Eve, Mother of
the Church, continues in heaven to exercise her maternal role on
behalf of the members of Christ" (Paul VI, CPG # 15).

Article 10 "I BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS"
976 The Apostle's Creed associates faith in the forgiveness of sins not
only with faith in the Holy Spirit, but also with faith in the Church and
in the communion of saints. It was when he gave the Holy Spirit to his
apostles that the risen Christ conferred on them his own divine power
to forgive sins: "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any,
they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."518
(Part Two of the catechism will deal explicitly with the forgiveness of
sins through Baptism, the sacrament of Penance, and the other
sacraments, especially the Eucharist. Here it will suffice to suggest
some basic facts briefly.)

CHAPTER THREE I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT




Article 10 "I BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS"




I. One Baptism for the Forgiveness of Sins
977 Our Lord tied the forgiveness of sins to faith and Baptism: "Go
into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He who
believes and is baptized will be saved."519 Baptism is the first and
chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us with Christ,
who died for our sins and rose for our justification, so that "we too
might walk in newness of life."520
978 "When we made our first profession of faith while receiving the
holy Baptism that cleansed us, the forgiveness we received then was so
full and complete that there remained in us absolutely nothing left to
efface, neither original sin nor offenses committed by our own will, nor
was there left any penalty to suffer in order to expiate them.... Yet the
grace of Baptism delivers no one from all the weakness of nature. On
the contrary, we must still combat the movements of concupiscence
that never cease leading us into evil "521
979 In this battle against our inclination towards evil, who could be
brave and watchful enough to escape every wound of sin? "If the
Church has the power to forgive sins, then Baptism cannot be her only
means of using the keys of the Kingdom of heaven received from Jesus
Christ. the Church must be able to forgive all penitents their offenses,
even if they should sin until the last moment of their lives."522
980 It is through the sacrament of Penance that the baptized can be
reconciled with God and with the Church:
Penance has rightly been called by the holy Fathers "a laborious kind
of baptism." This sacrament of Penance is necessary for salvation for
those who have fallen after Baptism, just as Baptism is necessary for
salvation for those who have not yet been reborn.523

II. The Power of the Keys
981 After his Resurrection, Christ sent his apostles "so that repentance
and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all
nations."524 The apostles and their successors carry out this "ministry
of reconciliation," not only by announcing to men God's forgiveness
merited for us by Christ, and calling them to conversion and faith; but
also by communicating to them the forgiveness of sins in Baptism, and
reconciling them with God and with the Church through the power of
the keys, received from Christ:525
[The Church] has received the keys of the Kingdom of heaven so that,
in her, sins may be forgiven through Christ's blood and the Holy
Spirit's action. In this Church, the soul dead through sin comes back to
life in order to live with Christ, whose grace has saved us.526
982 There is no offense, however serious, that the Church cannot
forgive. "There is no one, however wicked and guilty, who may not
confidently hope for forgiveness, provided his repentance is honest.527
Christ who died for all men desires that in his Church the gates of
forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from
sin.528
983 Catechesis strives to awaken and nourish in the faithful faith in the
incomparable greatness of the risen Christ's gift to his Church: the
mission and the power to forgive sins through the ministry of the
apostles and their successors:
The Lord wills that his disciples possess a tremendous power: that his
lowly servants accomplish in his name all that he did when he was on
earth.529
Priests have received from God a power that he has given neither to
angels nor to archangels .... God above confirms what priests do here
below.530
Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would be no
hope of life to come or eternal liberation. Let us thank God who has
given his Church such a gift.531
984 The Creed links "the forgiveness of sins" with its profession of
faith in the Holy Spirit, for the risen Christ entrusted to the apostles
the power to forgive sins when he gave them the Holy Spirit.
985 Baptism is the first and chief sacrament of the forgiveness of sins:
it unites us to Christ, who died and rose, and gives us the Holy Spirit.
986 By Christ's will, the Church possesses the power to forgive the sins
of the baptized and exercises it through bishops and priests normally in
the sacrament of Penance.
987 "In the forgiveness of sins, both priests and sacraments are
instruments which our Lord Jesus Christ, the only author and liberal
giver of salvation, wills to use in order to efface our sins and give us the
grace of justification" (Roman Catechism, I, 11, 6).

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"
988 The Christian Creed - the profession of our faith in God, the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in God's creative, saving, and
sanctifying action - culminates in the proclamation of the resurrection
of the dead on the last day and in life everlasting.
989 We firmly believe, and hence we hope that, just as Christ is truly
risen from the dead and lives for ever, so after death the righteous will
live for ever with the risen Christ and he will raise them up on the last
day.532 Our resurrection, like his own, will be the work of the Most
Holy Trinity:
If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he
who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal
bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.533
990 The term "flesh" refers to man in his state of weakness and
mortality.534 The "resurrection of the flesh" (the literal formulation of
the Apostles' Creed) means not only that the immortal soul will live on
after death, but that even our "mortal body" will come to life again.535
991 Belief in the resurrection of the dead has been an essential element
of the Christian faith from its beginnings. "The confidence of
Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we live."536
How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But
if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;
if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your
faith is in vain.... But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the
first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.537

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"




I. Christ's Resurrection and Ours
The progressive revelation of the Resurrection
992 God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people
progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead established
itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the whole
man, soul and body. the creator of heaven and earth is also the one
who faithfully maintains his covenant with Abraham and his posterity.
It was in this double perspective that faith in the resurrection came to
be expressed. In their trials, the Maccabean martyrs confessed:
The King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of
life, because we have died for his laws.538 One cannot but choose to
die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of
being raised again by him.539
993 The Pharisees and many of the Lord's contemporaries hoped for
the resurrection. Jesus teaches it firmly. To the Sadducees who deny it
he answers, "Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the
scriptures nor the power of God?"540 Faith in the resurrection rests on
faith in God who "is not God of the dead, but of the living."541
994 But there is more. Jesus links faith in the resurrection to his own
person: "I am the Resurrection and the life."542 It is Jesus himself who
on the last day will raise up those who have believed in him, who have
eaten his body and drunk his blood.543 Already now in this present
life he gives a sign and pledge of this by restoring some of the dead to
life,544 announcing thereby his own Resurrection, though it was to be
of another order. He speaks of this unique event as the "sign of
Jonah,"545 The sign of the temple: he announces that he will be put to
death but rise thereafter on the third day.546
995 To be a witness to Christ is to be a "witness to his Resurrection,"
to "[have eaten and drunk] with him after he rose from the dead."547
Encounters with the risen Christ characterize the Christian hope of
resurrection. We shall rise like Christ, with him, and through him.
996 From the beginning, Christian faith in the resurrection has met
with incomprehension and opposition.548 "On no point does the
Christian faith encounter more opposition than on the resurrection of
the body."549 It is very commonly accepted that the life of the human
person continues in a spiritual fashion after death. But how can we
believe that this body, so clearly mortal, could rise to everlasting life?
How do the dead rise?
997 What is "rising"? In death, the separation of the soul from the
body, the human body decays and the soul goes to meet God, while
awaiting its reunion with its glorified body. God, in his almighty power,
will definitively grant incorruptible life to our bodies by reuniting them
with our souls, through the power of Jesus' Resurrection.
998 Who will rise? All the dead will rise, "those who have done good, to
the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the
resurrection of judgment."550
999 How? Christ is raised with his own body: "See my hands and my
feet, that it is I myself";551 but he did not return to an earthly life. So,
in him, "all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they
now bear," but Christ "will change our lowly body to be like his
glorious body," into a "spiritual body":552
But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of
body do they come?" You foolish man! What you sow does not come to
life unless it dies. and what you sow is not the body which is to be, but
a bare kernel ....What is sown is perishable, what is raised is
imperishable.... the dead will be raised imperishable.... For this
perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature
must put on immortality.553
1000 This "how" exceeds our imagination and understanding; it is
accessible only to faith. Yet our participation in the Eucharist already
gives us a foretaste of Christ's transfiguration of our bodies:
Just as bread that comes from the earth, after God's blessing has been
invoked upon it, is no longer ordinary bread, but Eucharist, formed of
two things, the one earthly and the other heavenly: so too our bodies,
which partake of the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, but possess
the hope of resurrection.554
1001 When? Definitively "at the last day," "at the end of the world."555
Indeed, the resurrection of the dead is closely associated with Christ's
Parousia:
For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a cry of
command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet
of God. and the dead in Christ will rise first.556
Risen with Christ
1002 Christ will raise us up "on the last day"; but it is also true that, in
a certain way, we have already risen with Christ. For, by virtue of the
Holy Spirit, Christian life is already now on earth a participation in the
death and Resurrection of Christ:
And you were buried with him in Baptism, in which you were also
raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him
from the dead .... If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the
things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of
God.557
1003 United with Christ by Baptism, believers already truly participate
in the heavenly life of the risen Christ, but this life remains "hidden
with Christ in God."558 The Father has already "raised us up with
him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ
Jesus."559 Nourished with his body in the Eucharist, we already
belong to the Body of Christ. When we rise on the last day we "also will
appear with him in glory."560
1004 In expectation of that day, the believer's body and soul already
participate in the dignity of belonging to Christ. This dignity entails the
demand that he should treat with respect his own body, but also the
body of every other person, especially the suffering:
The body [is meant] for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. and God
raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not
know that your bodies are members of Christ? .... You are not your
own; .... So glorify God in your body.561

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"




II. Dying in Christ Jesus
1005 To rise with Christ, we must die with Christ: we must "be away
from the body and at home with the Lord."562 In that "departure"
which is death the soul is separated from the body.563 It will be
reunited with the body on the day of resurrection of the dead.564
Death
1006 "It is in regard to death that man's condition is most shrouded in
doubt."565 In a sense bodily death is natural, but for faith it is in fact
"the wages of sin."566 For those who die in Christ's grace it is a
participation in the death of the Lord, so that they can also share his
Resurrection.567
1007 Death is the end of earthly life. Our lives are measured by time,
in the course of which we change, grow old and, as with all living
beings on earth, death seems like the normal end of life. That aspect of
death lends urgency to our lives: remembering our mortality helps us
realize that we have only a limited time in which to bring our lives to
fulfillment:
Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, . . . before the
dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who
gave it.568
1008 Death is a consequence of sin. the Church's Magisterium, as
authentic interpreter of the affirmations of Scripture and Tradition,
teaches that death entered the world on account of man's sin.569 Even
though man's nature is mortal God had destined him not to die. Death
was therefore contrary to the plans of God the Creator and entered the
world as a consequence of sin.570 "Bodily death, from which man
would have been immune had he not sinned" is thus "the last enemy"
of man left to be conquered.571
1009 Death is transformed by Christ. Jesus, the Son of God, also
himself suffered the death that is part of the human condition. Yet,
despite his anguish as he faced death, he accepted it in an act of
complete and free submission to his Father's will.572 The obedience of
Jesus has transformed the curse of death into a blessing.573
The meaning of Christian death
1010 Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning: "For
to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."574 "The saying is sure: if we
have died with him, we will also live with him.575 What is essentially
new about Christian death is this: through Baptism, the Christian has
already "died with Christ" sacramentally, in order to live a new life; and
if we die in Christ's grace, physical death completes this "dying with
Christ" and so completes our incorporation into him in his redeeming
act:
It is better for me to die in (eis) Christ Jesus than to reign over the
ends of the earth. Him it is I seek - who died for us. Him it is I desire -
who rose for us. I am on the point of giving birth .... Let me receive
pure light; when I shall have arrived there, then shall I be a man.576
1011 In death, God calls man to himself. Therefore the Christian can
experience a desire for death like St. Paul's: "My desire is to depart and
be with Christ. "577 He can transform his own death into an act of
obedience and love towards the Father, after the example of Christ:578
My earthly desire has been crucified; . . . there is living water in me,
water that murmurs and says within me: Come to the Father.579
I want to see God and, in order to see him, I must die.580
I am not dying; I am entering life.581
1012 The Christian vision of death receives privileged expression in the
liturgy of the Church:582
Lord, for your faithful people life is changed, not ended. When the
body of our earthly dwelling lies in death we gain an everlasting
dwelling place in heaven.583
1013 Death is the end of man's earthly pilgrimage, of the time of grace
and mercy which God offers him so as to work out his earthly life in
keeping with the divine plan, and to decide his ultimate destiny. When
"the single course of our earthly life" is completed,584 we shall not
return to other earthly lives: "It is appointed for men to die once."585
There is no "reincarnation" after death.
1014 The Church encourages us to prepare ourselves for the hour of
our death. In the ancient litany of the saints, for instance, she has us
pray: "From a sudden and unforeseen death, deliver us, O Lord";586
to ask the Mother of God to intercede for us "at the hour of our death"
in the Hail Mary; and to entrust ourselves to St. Joseph, the patron of a
happy death.
Every action of yours, every thought, should be those of one who
expects to die before the day is out. Death would have no great terrors
for you if you had a quiet conscience .... Then why not keep clear of sin
instead of running away from death? If you aren't fit to face death
today, it's very unlikely you will be tomorrow ....587
Praised are you, my Lord, for our sister bodily Death,
from whom no living man can escape.
Woe on those who will die in mortal sin!
Blessed are they who will be found in your most holy will,
for the second death will not harm them.588

Article 11 "I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"
IN BRIEF
1015 "The flesh is the hinge of salvation" (Tertullian, De res. 8, 2: PL
2, 852). We believe in God who is creator of the flesh; we believe in the
Word made flesh in order to redeem the flesh; we believe in the
resurrection of the flesh, the fulfillment of both the creation and the
redemption of the flesh.
1016 By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the
resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed
by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all
of us will rise at the last day.
1017 "We believe in the true resurrection of this flesh that we now
possess" (Council of Lyons II: DS 854). We sow a corruptible body in
the tomb, but he raises up an incorruptible body, a "spiritual body" (cf
1 Cor 15:42-44).
1018 As a consequence of original sin, man must suffer "bodily death,
from which man would have been immune had he not sinned" (GS #
18).
1019 Jesus, the Son of God, freely suffered death for us in complete
and free submission to the will of God, his Father. By his death he has
conquered death, and so opened the possibility of salvation to all men.

Article 12 "I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING"
1020 The Christian who unites his own death to that of Jesus views it
as a step towards him and an entrance into everlasting life. When the
Church for the last time speaks Christ's words of pardon and
absolution over the dying Christian, seals him for the last time with a
strengthening anointing, and gives him Christ in viaticum as
nourishment for the journey, she speaks with gentle assurance:
Go forth, Christian soul, from this world
in the name of God the almighty Father,
who created you,
in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God,
who suffered for you,
in the name of the Holy Spirit,
who was poured out upon you.
Go forth, faithful Christian!
May you live in peace this day,
may your home be with God in Zion,
with Mary, the virgin Mother of God,
with Joseph, and all the angels and saints....
May you return to [your Creator]
who formed you from the dust of the earth.
May holy Mary, the angels, and all the saints
come to meet you as you go forth from this life....
May you see your Redeemer face to face. 589

I. The Particular Judgment
1021 Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either
accepting or rejecting the divine grace manifested in Christ.590 The
New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the final
encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeatedly
affirms that each will be rewarded immediately after death in
accordance with his works and faith. the parable of the poor man
Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as well
as other New Testament texts speak of a final destiny of the soul -a
destiny which can be different for some and for others.591
1022 Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at
the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his
life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of heaven-through a
purification592 or immediately,593-or immediate and everlasting
damnation.594
At the evening of life, we shall be judged on our love.595

II. Heaven
1023 Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly
purified live for ever with Christ. They are like God for ever, for they
"see him as he is," face to face:596
By virtue of our apostolic authority, we define the following: According
to the general disposition of God, the souls of all the saints . . . and
other faithful who died after receiving Christ's holy Baptism (provided
they were not in need of purification when they died, . . . or, if they
then did need or will need some purification, when they have been
purified after death, . . .) already before they take up their bodies again
and before the general judgment - and this since the Ascension of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into heaven - have been, are and will be
in heaven, in the heavenly Kingdom and celestial paradise with Christ,
joined to the company of the holy angels. Since the Passion and death
of our Lord Jesus Christ, these souls have seen and do see the divine
essence with an intuitive vision, and even face to face, without the
mediation of any creature.597
1024 This perfect life with the Most Holy Trinity - this communion of
life and love with the Trinity, with the Virgin Mary, the angels and all
the blessed - is called "heaven." Heaven is the ultimate end and
fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme,
definitive happiness.
1025 To live in heaven is "to be with Christ." the elect live "in
Christ,"598 but they retain, or rather find, their true identity, their own
name.599
For life is to be with Christ; where Christ is, there is life, there is the
kingdom.600
1026 By his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has "opened" heaven
to us. the life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect possession
of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ. He makes
partners in his heavenly glorification those who have believed in him
and remained faithful to his will. Heaven is the blessed community of
all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.
1027 This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in
Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of
it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the
Father's house, the heavenly Jerusalem, paradise: "no eye has seen, nor
ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for
those who love him."601
1028 Because of his transcendence, God cannot be seen as he is,
unless he himself opens up his mystery to man's immediate
contemplation and gives him the capacity for it. the Church calls this
contemplation of God in his heavenly glory "the beatific vision":
How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God,
to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with
Christ your Lord and God, . . . to delight in the joy of immortality in
the Kingdom of heaven with the righteous and God's friends.602
1029 In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill
God's will in relation to other men and to all creation. Already they
reign with Christ; with him "they shall reign for ever and ever."603

III. The Final Purification, or Purgatory
1030 All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly
purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death
they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to
enter the joy of heaven.
1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of
the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the
damned.604 The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on
Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. the
tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture,
speaks of a cleansing fire:605
As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final
Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that whoever
utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned neither in
this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we understand that
certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but certain others in the
age to come.606
1032 This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead,
already mentioned in Sacred Scripture: "Therefore Judas Maccabeus]
made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their
sin."607 From the beginning the Church has honored the memory of
the dead and offered prayers in suffrage for them, above all the
Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified, they may attain the beatific
vision of God.608 The Church also commends almsgiving,
indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead:
Let us help and commemorate them. If Job's sons were purified by
their father's sacrifice, why would we doubt that our offerings for the
dead bring them some consolation? Let us not hesitate to help those
who have died and to offer our prayers for them.609

IV. Hell
1033 We cannot be united with God unless we freely choose to love
him. But we cannot love God if we sin gravely against him, against our
neighbor or against ourselves: "He who does not love remains in death.
Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life abiding in him."610 Our Lord warns us that
we shall be separated from him if we fail to meet the serious needs of
the poor and the little ones who are his brethren.611 To die in mortal
sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means
remaining separated from him for ever by our own free choice. This
state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the
blessed is called "hell."
1034 Jesus often speaks of "Gehenna" of "the unquenchable fire"
reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be
converted, where both soul and body can be lost.612 Jesus solemnly
proclaims that he "will send his angels, and they will gather . . . all evil
doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire,"613 and that he will
pronounce the condemnation: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the
eternal fire!"614
1035 The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its
eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state
of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of
hell, "eternal fire."615 The chief punishment of hell is eternal
separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and
happiness for which he was created and for which he longs.
1036 The affirmations of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of the
Church on the subject of hell are a call to the responsibility incumbent
upon man to make use of his freedom in view of his eternal destiny.
They are at the same time an urgent call to conversion: "Enter by the
narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to
destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow
and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are
few."616
Since we know neither the day nor the hour, we should follow the
advice of the Lord and watch constantly so that, when the single
course of our earthly life is completed, we may merit to enter with him
into the marriage feast and be numbered among the blessed, and not,
like the wicked and slothful servants, be ordered to depart into the
eternal fire, into the outer darkness where "men will weep and gnash
their teeth."617
1037 God predestines no one to go to hell;618 for this, a willful
turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence in
it until the end. In the Eucharistic liturgy and in the daily prayers of
her faithful, the Church implores the mercy of God, who does not
want "any to perish, but all to come to repentance":619
Father, accept this offering
from your whole family.
Grant us your peace in this life,
save us from final damnation,
and count us among those you have chosen.620

V. The Last Judgment
1038 The resurrection of all the dead, "of both the just and the
unjust,"621 will precede the Last Judgment. This will be "the hour
when all who are in the tombs will hear [the Son of man's] voice and
come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and
those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment."622 Then
Christ will come "in his glory, and all the angels with him .... Before
him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one
from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he
will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.... and
they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
eternal life."623
1039 In the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of each
man's relationship with God will be laid bare.624 The Last Judgment
will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has
done or failed to do during his earthly life:


All that the wicked do is recorded, and they do not know. When "our
God comes, he does not keep silence.". . . he will turn towards those at
his left hand: . . . "I placed my poor little ones on earth for you. I as
their head was seated in heaven at the right hand of my Father - but on
earth my members were suffering, my members on earth were in need.
If you gave anything to my members, what you gave would reach their
Head. Would that you had known that my little ones were in need
when I placed them on earth for you and appointed them your
stewards to bring your good works into my treasury. But you have
placed nothing in their hands; therefore you have found nothing in my
presence."625
1040 The Last Judgment will come when Christ returns in glory. Only
the Father knows the day and the hour; only he determines the
moment of its coming. Then through his Son Jesus Christ he will
pronounce the final word on all history. We shall know the ultimate
meaning of the whole work of creation and of the entire economy of
salvation and understand the marvellous ways by which his Providence
led everything towards its final end. the Last Judgment will reveal that
God's justice triumphs over all the injustices committed by his
creatures and that God's love is stronger than death.626
1041 The message of the Last Judgment calls men to conversion while
God is still giving them "the acceptable time, . . . the day of
salvation."627 It inspires a holy fear of God and commits them to the
justice of the Kingdom of God. It proclaims the "blessed hope" of the
Lord's return, when he will come "to be glorified in his saints, and to
be marvelled at in all who have believed."628

VI. Hope of the New Heaven and the New Earth
1042 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness.
After the universal judgment, the righteous will reign for ever with
Christ, glorified in body and soul. the universe itself will be renewed:
The Church . . . will receive her perfection only in the glory of heaven,
when will come the time of the renewal of all things. At that time,
together with the human race, the universe itself, which is so closely
related to man and which attains its destiny through him, will be
perfectly re-established in Christ.629
1043 Sacred Scripture calls this mysterious renewal, which will
transform humanity and the world, "new heavens and a new
earth."630 It will be the definitive realization of God's plan to bring
under a single head "all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things
on earth."631
1044 In this new universe, the heavenly Jerusalem, God will have his
dwelling among men.632 "He will wipe away every tear from their
eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor
crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."633
1045 For man, this consummation will be the final realization of the
unity of the human race, which God willed from creation and of which
the pilgrim Church has been "in the nature of sacrament."634 Those
who are united with Christ will form the community of the redeemed,
"the holy city" of God, "the Bride, the wife of the Lamb."635 She will
not be wounded any longer by sin, stains, self-love, that destroy or
wound the earthly community.636 The beatific vision, in which God
opens himself in an inexhaustible way to the elect, will be the ever-
flowing well-spring of happiness, peace, and mutual communion.
1046 For the cosmos, Revelation affirms the profound common
destiny of the material world and man:
For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons
of God . . . in hope because the creation itself will be set free from its
bondage to decay.... We know that the whole creation has been
groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation, but
we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as
we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.637
1047 The visible universe, then, is itself destined to be transformed, "so
that the world itself, restored to its original state, facing no further
obstacles, should be at the service of the just," sharing their
glorification in the risen Jesus Christ.638


1048 "We know neither the moment of the consummation of the earth
and of man, nor the way in which the universe will be transformed. the
form of this world, distorted by sin, is passing away, and we are taught
that God is preparing a new dwelling and a new earth in which
righteousness dwells, in which happiness will fill and surpass all the
desires of peace arising in the hearts of men."639
1049 "Far from diminishing our concern to develop this earth, the
expectancy of a new earth should spur us on, for it is here that the
body of a new human family grows, foreshadowing in some way the
age which is to come. That is why, although we must be careful to
distinguish earthly progress clearly from the increase of the kingdom of
Christ, such progress is of vital concern to the kingdom of God, insofar
as it can contribute to the better ordering of human society."640
1050 "When we have spread on earth the fruits of our nature and our
enterprise . . . according to the command of the Lord and in his Spirit,
we will find them once again, cleansed this time from the stain of sin,
illuminated and transfigured, when Christ presents to his Father an
eternal and universal kingdom."641 God will then be "all in all" in
eternal life:642
True and subsistent life consists in this: the Father, through the Son
and in the Holy Spirit, pouring out his heavenly gifts on all things
without exception. Thanks to his mercy, we too, men that we are, have
received the inalienable promise of eternal life.643

IN BRIEF
1051 Every man receives his eternal recompense in his immortal soul
from the moment of his death in a particular judgment by Christ, the
judge of the living and the dead.
1052 "We believe that the souls of all who die in Christ's grace . . . are
the People of God beyond death. On the day of resurrection, death will
be definitively conquered, when these souls will be reunited with their
bodies" (Paul VI, CPG # 28).
1053 "We believe that the multitude of those gathered around Jesus
and Mary in Paradise forms the Church of heaven, where in eternal
blessedness they see God as he is and where they are also, to various
degrees, associated with the holy angels in the divine governance
exercised by Christ in glory, by interceding for us and helping our
weakness by their fraternal concern" (Paul VI, CPG # 29).
1054 Those who die in God's grace and friendship imperfectly
purified, although they are assured of their eternal salvation, undergo a
purification after death, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter
the joy of God.
1055 By virtue of the "communion of saints," the Church commends
the dead to God's mercy and offers her prayers, especially the holy
sacrifice of the Eucharist, on their behalf.
1056 Following the example of Christ, the Church warns the faithful
of the "sad and lamentable reality of eternal death" (GCD 69), also
called "hell."
1057 Hell's principal punishment consists of eternal separation from
God in whom alone man can have the life and happiness for which he
was created and for which he longs.
1058 The Church prays that no one should be lost: "Lord, let me never
be parted from you." If it is true that no one can save himself, it is also
true that God "desires all men to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4), and that for
him "all things are possible" (Mt 19:26).
1059 "The holy Roman Church firmly believes and confesses that on
the Day of Judgment all men will appear in their own bodies before
Christ's tribunal to render an account of their own deeds" (Council of
Lyons II [1274]: DS 859; cf. DS 1549).
1060 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness.
Then the just will reign with Christ for ever, glorified in body and soul,
and the material universe itself will be transformed. God will then be
"all in all" (1 Cor 15:28), in eternal life.

Article 12 "I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING"




"Amen"
1061 The Creed, like the last book of the Bible,644 ends with the
Hebrew word amen. This word frequently concludes prayers in the
New Testament. the Church likewise ends her prayers with "Amen."
1062 In Hebrew, amen comes from the same root as the word
"believe." This root expresses solidity, trustworthiness, faithfulness. and
so we can understand why "Amen" may express both God's
faithfulness towards us and our trust in him.
1063 In the book of the prophet Isaiah, we find the expression "God of
truth" (literally "God of the Amen"), that is, the God who is faithful to
his promises: "He who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by
the God of truth [amen]."645 Our Lord often used the word "Amen,"
sometimes repeated,646 to emphasize the trustworthiness of his
teaching, his authority founded on God's truth.
1064 Thus the Creed's final "Amen" repeats and confirms its first
words: "I believe." To believe is to say "Amen" to God's words,
promises and commandments; to entrust oneself completely to him
who is the "Amen" of infinite love and perfect faithfulness. the
Christian's everyday life will then be the "Amen" to the "I believe" of
our baptismal profession of faith:
May your Creed be for you as a mirror. Look at yourself in it, to see if
you believe everything you say you believe. and rejoice in your faith
each day.647
1065 Jesus Christ himself is the "Amen."648 He is the definitive
"Amen" of the Father's love for us. He takes up and completes our
"Amen" to the Father: "For all the promises of God find their Yes in
him. That is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of
God":649
Through him, with him, in him,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
almighty Father,
God, for ever and ever.
AMEN.

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN
MYSTERY
Why the liturgy?
1066 In the Symbol of the faith the Church confesses the mystery of
the Holy Trinity and of the plan of God's "good pleasure" for all
creation: the Father accomplishes the "mystery of his will" by giving his
beloved Son and his Holy Spirit for the salvation of the world and for
the glory of his name.1
Such is the mystery of Christ, revealed and fulfilled in history
according to the wisely ordered plan that St. Paul calls the "plan of the
mystery"2 and the patristic tradition will call the "economy of the Word
incarnate" or the "economy of salvation."
1067 "The wonderful works of God among the people of the Old
Testament were but a prelude to the work of Christ the Lord in
redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He accomplished
this work principally by the Paschal mystery of his blessed Passion,
Resurrection from the dead, and glorious Ascension, whereby 'dying he
destroyed our death, rising he restored our life.' For it was from the
side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there
came forth 'the wondrous sacrament of the whole Church."'3
For this reason, the Church celebrates in the liturgy above all the
Paschal mystery by which Christ accomplished the work of our
salvation.
1068 It is this mystery of Christ that the Church proclaims and
celebrates in her liturgy so that the faithful may live from it and bear
witness to it in the world:
For it is in the liturgy, especially in the divine sacrifice of the Eucharist,
that "the work of our redemption is accomplished," and it is through
the liturgy especially that the faithful are enabled to express in their
lives and manifest to others the mystery of Christ and the real nature
of the true Church.4
What does the word liturgy mean?
1069 The word "liturgy" originally meant a "public work" or a "service
in the name of/on behalf of the people."
In Christian tradition it means the participation of the People of God
in "the work of God."5
Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high priest, continues
the work of our redemption in, with, and through his Church.
1070 In the New Testament the word "liturgy" refers not only to the
celebration of divine worship but also to the proclamation of the
Gospel and to active charity.6 In all of these situations it is a question
of the service of God and neighbor.
In a liturgical celebration the Church is servant in the image of her
Lord, the one "leitourgos";7 she shares in Christ's priesthood
(worship), which is both prophetic (proclamation) and kingly (service
of charity):
The liturgy then is rightly seen as an exercise of the priestly office of
Jesus Christ.
It involves the presentation of man's sanctification under the guise of
signs perceptible by the senses and its accomplishment in ways
appropriate to each of these signs.
In it full public worship is performed by the Mystical Body of Jesus
Christ, that is, by the Head and his members.
From this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an
action of Christ the priest and of his Body which is the Church, is a
sacred action surpassing all others.
No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title
and to the same degree.8
Liturgy as source of life
1071 As the work of Christ liturgy is also an action of his Church. It
makes the Church present and manifests her as the visible sign of the
communion in Christ between God and men. It engages the faithful in
the new life of the community and involves the "conscious, active, and
fruitful participation" of everyone.9
1072 "The sacred liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of the
Church":10 it must be preceded by evangelization, faith, and
conversion. It can then produce its fruits in the lives of the faithful:
new life in the Spirit, involvement in the mission of the Church, and
service to her unity.
Prayer and liturgy
1073 The liturgy is also a participation in Christ's own prayer
addressed to the Father in the Holy Spirit. In the liturgy, all Christian
prayer finds its source and goal. Through the liturgy the inner man is
rooted and grounded in "the great love with which [the Father] loved
us" in his beloved Son.11 It is the same "marvelous work of God" that
is lived and internalized by all prayer, "at all times in the Spirit."12
Catechesis and liturgy
1074 "The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the
Church is directed; it is also the font from which all her power
flows."13
It is therefore the privileged place for catechizing the People of God.
"Catechesis is intrinsically linked with the whole of liturgical and
sacramental activity, for it is in the sacraments, especially in the
Eucharist, that Christ Jesus works in fullness for the transformation of
men."14
1075 Liturgical catechesis aims to initiate people into the mystery of
Christ (It is "mystagogy." ) by proceeding from the visible to the
invisible, from the sign to the thing signified, from the "sacraments" to
the "mysteries."
Such catechesis is to be presented by local and regional catechisms.
This Catechism, which aims to serve the whole Church in all the
diversity of her rites and cultures,15 will present what is fundamental
and common to the whole Church in the liturgy as mystery and as
celebration, and then the seven sacraments and the sacramentals.

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN
MYSTERY




SECTION ONE THE SACRAMENTAL ECONOMY
1076 The Church was made manifest to the world on the day of
Pentecost by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.1 The gift of the Spirit
ushers in a new era in the "dispensation of the mystery" the age of the
Church, during which Christ manifests, makes present, and
communicates his work of salvation
through the liturgy of his Church, "until he comes."2 In this age of the
Church Christ now lives and acts in and with his Church, in a new way
appropriate to this new age. He acts through the sacraments in what
the common Tradition of the East and the West calls "the sacramental
economy"; this is the communication (or "dispensation") of the fruits
of Christ's Paschal mystery in the celebration of the Church's
"sacramental" liturgy.
It is therefore important first to explain this "sacramental dispensation"
(chapter one). the nature and essential features of liturgical celebration
will then appear more clearly (chapter two).

Article 1 THE LITURGY - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY
I. The Father-Source and Goal of the Liturgy
1077 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us
before him in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the
purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace which he freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved."3
1078 Blessing is a divine and life-giving action, the source of which is
the Father; his blessing is both word and gift.4 When applied to man,
the word "blessing" means adoration and surrender to his Creator in
thanksgiving.
1079 From the beginning until the end of time the whole of God's
work is a blessing. From the liturgical poem of the first creation to the
canticles of the heavenly Jerusalem, the inspired authors proclaim the
plan of salvation as one vast divine blessing.
1080 From the very beginning God blessed all living beings, especially
man and woman. the covenant with Noah and with all living things
renewed this blessing of fruitfulness despite man's sin which had
brought a curse on the ground. But with Abraham, the divine blessing
entered into human history which was moving toward death, to
redirect it toward life, toward its source. By the faith of "the father of
all believers," who embraced the blessing, the history of salvation is
inaugurated.
1081 The divine blessings were made manifest in astonishing and
saving events: the birth of Isaac, the escape from Egypt (Passover and
Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of David, the
presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and return of a
"small remnant." the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, interwoven in
the liturgy of the Chosen People, recall these divine blessings and at
the same time respond to them with blessings of praise and
thanksgiving.
1082 In the Church's liturgy the divine blessing is fully revealed and
communicated. the Father is acknowledged and adored as the source
and the end of all the blessings of creation and salvation. In his Word
who became incarnate, died, and rose for us, he fills us with his
blessings. Through his Word, he pours into our hearts the Gift that
contains all gifts, the Holy Spirit.
1083 The dual dimension of the Christian liturgy as a response of faith
and love to the spiritual blessings the Father bestows on us is thus
evident. On the one hand, the Church, united with her Lord and "in
the Holy Spirit,"5 blesses the Father "for his inexpressible gift6 in her
adoration, praise, and thanksgiving. On the other hand, until the
consummation of God's plan, the Church never ceases to present to
the Father the offering of his own gifts and to beg him to send the
Holy Spirit upon that offering, upon herself, upon the faithful, and
upon the whole world, so that through communion in the death and
resurrection of Christ the Priest, and by the power of the Spirit, these
divine blessings will bring forth the fruits of life "to the praise of his
glorious grace."7

II. Christ's Work in the Liturgy
Christ glorified . . .
1084 "Seated at the right hand of the Father" and pouring out the
Holy Spirit on his Body which is the Church, Christ now acts through
the sacraments he instituted to communicate his grace. the sacraments
are perceptible signs (words and actions) accessible to our human
nature. By the action of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit they
make present efficaciously the grace that they signify.
1085 In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal
mystery that Christ signifies and makes present. During his earthly life
Jesus announced his Paschal mystery by his teaching and anticipated it
by his actions. When his Hour comes, he lives out the unique event of
history which does not pass away: Jesus dies, is buried, rises from the
dead, and is seated at the right hand of the Father "once for all."8 His
Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our history, but it is
unique: all other historical events happen once, and then they pass
away, swallowed up in the past. the Paschal mystery of Christ, by
contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he
destroyed death, and all that Christ is - all that he did and suffered for
all men - participates in the divine eternity, and so transcends all times
while being made present in them all. the event of the Cross and
Resurrection abides and draws everything toward life.
. . . from the time of the Church of the Apostles . . .
1086 "Accordingly, just as Christ was sent by the Father so also he sent
the apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit. This he did so that they might
preach the Gospel to every creature and proclaim that the Son of God
by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of Satan
and from death and brought us into the Kingdom of his Father. But he
also willed that the work of salvation which they preached should be
set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments, around which the
entire liturgical life revolves."9
1087 Thus the risen Christ, by giving the Holy Spirit to the apostles,
entrusted to them his power of sanctifying:10 they became sacramental
signs of Christ. By the power of the same Holy Spirit they entrusted
this power to their successors. This
"apostolic succession" structures the whole liturgical life of the Church
and is itself sacramental, handed on by the sacrament of Holy Orders.
. . . is present in the earthly liturgy . . .
1088 "To accomplish so great a work" - the dispensation or
communication of his work of salvation - "Christ is always present in
his Church, especially in her liturgical celebrations. He is present in the
Sacrifice of the Mass not only in the person of his minister, 'the same
now offering, through the ministry of priests, who formerly offered
himself on the cross,' but especially in the Eucharistic species. By his
power he is present in the sacraments so that when anybody baptizes, it
is really Christ himself who baptizes. He is present in his word since it
is he himself who speaks when the holy Scriptures are read in the
Church. Lastly, he is present when the Church prays and sings, for he
has promised 'where two or three are gathered together in my name
there am I in the midst of them."'11
1089 "Christ, indeed, always associates the Church with himself in this
great work in which God is perfectly glorified and men are sanctified.
the Church is his beloved Bride who calls to her Lord and through him
offers worship to the eternal Father."12
. . . which participates in the liturgy of heaven
1090 "In the earthly liturgy we share in a foretaste of that heavenly
liturgy which is celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem toward which
we journey as pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God,
Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle. With all the
warriors of the heavenly army we sing a hymn of glory to the Lord;
venerating the memory of the saints, we hope for some part and
fellowship with them; we eagerly await the Savior, our Lord Jesus
Christ, until he, our life, shall appear and we too will appear with him
in glory."13

III. The Holy Spirit and the Church in the Liturgy
1091 In the liturgy the Holy Spirit is teacher of the faith of the People
of God and artisan of "God's masterpieces," the sacraments of the
New Covenant. the desire and work of the Spirit in the heart of the
Church is that we may live from the life of the risen Christ. When the
Spirit encounters in us the response of faith which he has aroused in
us, he brings about genuine cooperation. Through it, the liturgy
becomes the common work of the Holy Spirit and the Church.
1092 In this sacramental dispensation of Christ's mystery the Holy
Spirit acts in the same way as at other times in the economy of
salvation: he prepares the Church to encounter her Lord; he recalls
and makes Christ manifest to the faith of the assembly. By his
transforming power, he makes the mystery of Christ present here and
now. Finally the Spirit of communion unites the Church to the life and
mission of Christ.
The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ
1093 In the sacramental economy the Holy Spirit fulfills what was
prefigured in the Old Covenant. Since Christ's Church was "prepared
in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of Israel and in the
Old Covenant,"14 The Church's liturgy has retained certain elements
of the worship of the Old Covenant as integral and irreplaceable,
adopting them as her own:
-notably, reading the Old Testament;
-praying the Psalms;
-above all, recalling the saving events and significant realities which
have found their fulfillment in the mystery of Christ (promise and
covenant, Exodus and Passover, kingdom and temple, exile and
return).
1094 It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal
catechesis of the Lord is built,15 and then, that of the Apostles and the
Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under
the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called
"typological" because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of
the "figures" (types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and
symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth,
starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled.16 Thus the flood and
Noah's ark prefigured salvation by Baptism,17 as did the cloud and the
crossing of the Red Sea. Water from the rock was the figure of the
spiritual gifts of Christ, and manna in the desert prefigured the
Eucharist, "the true bread from heaven."18
1095 For this reason the Church, especially during Advent and Lent
and above all at the Easter Vigil, re-reads and re-lives the great events
of salvation history in the "today" of her liturgy. But this also demands
that catechesis help the faithful to open themselves to this spiritual
understanding of the economy of salvation as the Church's liturgy
reveals it and enables us to live it.
1096 Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy. A better knowledge of the
Jewish people's faith and religious life as professed and lived even now
can help our better understanding of certain aspects of Christian
liturgy. For both Jews and Christians Sacred Scripture is an essential
part of their respective liturgies: in the proclamation of the Word of
God, the response to this word, prayer of praise and intercession for
the living and the dead, invocation of God's mercy. In its characteristic
structure the Liturgy of the Word originates in Jewish prayer. the
Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical texts and formularies, as well
as those of our most venerable prayers, including the Lord's Prayer,
have parallels in Jewish prayer. the Eucharistic Prayers also draw their
inspiration from the Jewish tradition. the relationship between Jewish
liturgy and Christian liturgy, but also their differences in content, are
particularly evident in the great feasts of the liturgical year, such as
Passover. Christians and Jews both celebrate the Passover. For Jews, it
is the Passover of history, tending toward the future; for Christians, it is
the Passover fulfilled in the death and Resurrection of Christ, though
always in expectation of its definitive consummation.
1097 In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action,
especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an
encounter between Christ and the Church. the liturgical assembly
derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who gathers
the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly
transcends racial, cultural, social - indeed, all human affinities.
1098 The assembly should prepare itself to encounter its Lord and to
become "a people well disposed." the preparation of hearts is the joint
work of the Holy Spirit and the assembly, especially of its ministers. the
grace of the Holy Spirit seeks to awaken faith, conversion of heart, and
adherence to the Father's will. These dispositions are the precondition
both for the reception of other graces conferred in the celebration itself
and the fruits of new life which the celebration is intended to produce
afterward.
The Holy Spirit recalls the mystery of Christ
1099 The Spirit and the Church cooperate to manifest Christ and his
work of salvation in the liturgy. Primarily in the Eucharist, and by
analogy in the other sacraments, the liturgy is the memorial of the
mystery of salvation. the Holy Spirit is the Church's living memory.19
1100 The Word of God. the Holy Spirit first recalls the meaning of the
salvation event to the liturgical assembly by giving life to the Word of
God, which is proclaimed so that it may be received and lived:
In the celebration of the liturgy, Sacred Scripture is extremely
important. From it come the lessons that are read and explained in the
homily and the psalms that are sung. It is from the Scriptures that the
prayers, collects, and hymns draw their inspiration and their force, and
that actions and signs derive their meaning.20
1101 The Holy Spirit gives a spiritual understanding of the Word of
God to those who read or hear it, according to the dispositions of their
hearts. By means of the words, actions, and symbols that form the
structure of a celebration, the Spirit puts both the faithful and the
ministers into a living relationship with Christ, the Word and Image of
the Father, so that they can live out the meaning of what they hear,
contemplate, and do in the celebration.
1102 "By the saving word of God, faith . . . is nourished in the hearts
of believers. By this faith then the congregation of the faithful begins
and grows."21 The proclamation does not stop with a teaching; it
elicits the response of faith as consent and commitment, directed at the
covenant between God and his people. Once again it is the Holy Spirit
who gives the grace of faith, strengthens it and makes it grow in the
community. the liturgical assembly is first of all a communion in faith.
1103 Anamnesis. the liturgical celebration always refers to God's saving
interventions in history. "The economy of Revelation is realized by
deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other....
(The) words for their part proclaim the works and bring to light the
mystery they contain."22 In the Liturgy of the Word the Holy Spirit
"recalls" to the assembly all that Christ has done for us. In keeping
with the nature of liturgical actions and the ritual traditions of the
churches, the celebration "makes a remembrance" of the marvelous
works of God in an anamnesis which may be more or less developed.
the Holy Spirit who thus awakens the memory of the Church then
inspires thanksgiving and praise (doxology).
The Holy Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ
1104 Christian liturgy not only recalls the events that saved us but
actualizes them, makes them present. the Paschal mystery of Christ is
celebrated, not repeated. It is the celebrations that are repeated, and in
each celebration there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that makes
the unique mystery present.
1105 The Epiclesis ("invocation upon") is the intercession in which the
priest begs the Father to send the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, so that
the offerings may become the body and blood of Christ and that the
faithful by receiving them, may themselves become a living offering to
God.23
1106 Together with the anamnesis, the epiclesis is at the heart of each
sacramental celebration, most especially of the Eucharist:
You ask how the bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the wine . . .
the Blood of Christ I shall tell you: the Holy Spirit comes upon them
and accomplishes what surpasses every word and thought . . . Let it be
enough for you to understand that it is by the Holy Spirit, just as it was
of the Holy Virgin and by the Holy Spirit that the Lord, through and in
himself, took flesh.24
1107 The Holy Spirit's transforming power in the liturgy hastens the
coming of the kingdom and the consummation of the mystery of
salvation. While we wait in hope he causes us really to anticipate the
fullness of communion with the Holy Trinity. Sent by the Father who
hears the epiclesis of the Church, the Spirit gives life to those who
accept him and is, even now, the "guarantee" of their inheritance.25
The communion of the Holy Spirit
1108 In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring
us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. the Holy
Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its
branches.26 The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the
Church is achieved in the liturgy. the Spirit who is the Spirit of
communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this reason the
Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers
God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity
and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the
liturgy.27
1109 The epiclesis is also a prayer for the full effect of the assembly's
communion with the mystery of Christ. "The grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit"28
have to remain with us always and bear fruit beyond the Eucharistic
celebration. the Church therefore asks the Father to send the Holy
Spirit to make the lives of the faithful a living sacrifice to God by their
spiritual transformation into the image of Christ, by concern for the
Church's unity, and by taking part in her mission through the witness
and service of charity.

Article 1 THE LITURGY - WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY




IN BRIEF
1110 In the liturgy of the Church, God the Father is blessed and
adored as the source of all the blessings of creation and salvation with
which he has blessed us in his Son, in order to give us the Spirit of filial
adoption.
1111 Christ's work in the liturgy is sacramental: because his mystery of
salvation is made present there by the power of his Holy Spirit;
because his Body, which is the Church, is like a sacrament (sign and
instrument) in which the Holy Spirit dispenses the mystery of
salvation; and because through her liturgical actions the pilgrim
Church already participates, as by a foretaste, in the heavenly liturgy.
1112 The mission of the Holy Spirit in the liturgy of the Church is to
prepare the assembly to encounter Christ; to recall and manifest Christ
to the faith of the assembly; to make the saving work of Christ present
and active by his transforming power; and to make the gift of
communion bear fruit in the Church.

Article 2 THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH'S
SACRAMENTS
1113 The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves around the
Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments.29 There are seven sacraments
in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist,
Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.30 This
article will discuss what is common to the Church's seven sacraments
from a doctrinal point of view. What is common to them in terms of
their celebration will be presented in the second chapter, and what is
distinctive about each will be the topic of the Section Two.

I. The Sacraments of Christ
1114 "Adhering to the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, to the apostolic
traditions, and to the consensus . . . of the Fathers," we profess that
"the sacraments of the new law were . . . all instituted by Jesus Christ
our Lord."31
1115 Jesus' words and actions during his hidden life and public
ministry were already salvific, for they anticipated the power of his
Paschal mystery. They announced and prepared what he was going to
give the Church when all was accomplished. the mysteries of Christ's
life are the foundations of what he would henceforth dispense in the
sacraments, through the ministers of his Church, for "what was visible
in our Savior has passed over into his mysteries."32
1116 Sacraments are "powers that comes forth" from the Body of
Christ,33 which is ever-living and life-giving. They are actions of the
Holy Spirit at work in his Body, the Church. They are "the
masterworks of God" in the new and everlasting covenant.

II. The Sacraments of the Church
1117 As she has done for the canon of Sacred Scripture and for the
doctrine of the faith, the Church, by the power of the Spirit who guides
her "into all truth," has gradually recognized this treasure received
from Christ and, as the faithful steward of God's mysteries, has
determined its "dispensation."34 Thus the Church has discerned over
the centuries that among liturgical celebrations there are seven that
are, in the strict sense of the term, sacraments instituted by the Lord.
1118 The sacraments are "of the Church" in the double sense that they
are "by her" and "for her." They are "by the Church," for she is the
sacrament of Christ's action at work in her through the mission of the
Holy Spirit. They are "for the Church" in the sense that "the
sacraments make the Church,"35 since they manifest and
communicate to men, above all in the Eucharist, the mystery of
communion with the God who is love, One in three persons.
1119 Forming "as it were, one mystical person" with Christ the head,
the Church acts in the sacraments as "an organically structured priestly
community."36 Through Baptism and Confirmation the pRiestly
people is enabled to celebrate the liturgy, while those of the faithful
"who have received Holy Orders, are appointed to nourish the Church
with the word and grace of God in the name of Christ."37
1120 The ordained ministry or ministerial priesthood is at the service
of the baptismal priesthood.38 The ordained priesthood guarantees
that it really is Christ who acts in the sacraments through the Holy
Spirit for the Church. the saving mission entrusted by the Father to his
incarnate Son was committed to the apostles and through them to
their successors: they receive the Spirit of Jesus to act in his name and
in his person.39 The ordained minister is the sacramental bond that
ties the liturgical action to what the apostles said and did and, through
them, to the words and actions of Christ, the source and foundation of
the sacraments.
1121 The three sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy
Orders confer, in addition to grace, a sacramental character or "seal"
by which the Christian shares in Christ's priesthood and is made a
member of the Church according to different states and functions. This
configuration to Christ and to the Church, brought about by the Spirit,
is indelible,40 it remains for ever in the Christian as a positive
disposition for grace, a promise and guarantee of divine protection,
and as a vocation to divine worship and to the service of the Church.
Therefore these sacraments can never be repeated.

III. The Sacraments of Faith
1122 Christ sent his apostles so that "repentance and forgiveness of
sins should be preached in his name to all nations."41 "Go therefore
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."42 The mission to
baptize, and so the sacramental mission, is implied in the mission to
evangelize, because the sacrament is prepared for by the word of God
and by the faith which is assent to this word:
The People of God is formed into one in the first place by the Word of
the living God.... the preaching of the Word is required for the
sacramental ministry itself, since the sacraments are sacraments of
faith, drawing their origin and nourishment from the Word.43
1123 "The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build up
the Body of Christ and, finally, to give worship to God. Because they
are signs they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but by
words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and express it. That is
why they are called 'sacraments of faith."'44
1124 The Church's faith precedes the faith of the believer who is
invited to adhere to it. When the Church celebrates the sacraments, she
confesses the faith received from the apostles - whence the ancient
saying: lex orandi, lex credendi (or: legem credendi lex statuat
supplicandi according to Prosper of Aquitaine [5th cent.]).45 The law
of prayer is the law of faith: the Church believes as she prays. Liturgy is
a constitutive element of the holy and living Tradition.46
1125 For this reason no sacramental rite may be modified or
manipulated at the will of the minister or the community. Even the
supreme authority in the Church may not change the liturgy
arbitrarily, but only in the obedience of faith and with religious respect
for the mystery of the liturgy.
1126 Likewise, since the sacraments express and develop the
communion of faith in the Church, the lex orandi is one of the
essential criteria of the dialogue that seeks to restore the unity of
Christians.47

IV. The Sacraments of Salvation
1127 Celebrated worthily in faith, the sacraments confer the grace that
they signify.48 They are efficacious because in them Christ himself is at
work: it is he who baptizes, he who acts in his sacraments in order to
communicate the grace that each sacrament signifies. the Father always
hears the prayer of his Son's Church which, in the epiclesis of each
sacrament, expresses her faith in the power of the Spirit. As fire
transforms into itself everything it touches, so the Holy Spirit
transforms into the divine life whatever is subjected to his power.
1128 This is the meaning of the Church's affirmation49 that the
sacraments act ex opere operato (literally: "by the very fact of the
action's being performed"), i.e., by virtue of the saving work of Christ,
accomplished once for all. It follows that "the sacrament is not wrought
by the righteousness of either the celebrant or the recipient, but by the
power of God."50 From the moment that a sacrament is celebrated in
accordance with the intention of the Church, the power of Christ and
his Spirit acts in and through it, independently of the personal holiness
of the minister. Nevertheless, the fruits of the sacraments also depend
on the disposition of the one who receives them.
1129 The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the New
Covenant are necessary for salvation.51 "Sacramental grace" is the
grace of the Holy Spirit, given by Christ and proper to each sacrament.
the Spirit heals and transforms those who receive him by conforming
them to the Son of God. the fruit of the sacramental life is that the
Spirit of adoption makes the faithful partakers in the divine nature52
by uniting them in a living union with the only Son, the Savior.

V. The Sacraments of Eternal Life
1130 The Church celebrates the mystery of her Lord "until he comes,"
when God will be "everything to everyone."53 Since the apostolic age
the liturgy has been drawn toward its goal by the Spirit's groaning in
the Church: Marana tha!54 The liturgy thus shares in Jesus' desire: "I
have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you . . . until it is
fulfilled in the kingdom of God."55 In the sacraments of Christ the
Church already receives the guarantee of her inheritance and even now
shares in everlasting life, while "awaiting our blessed hope, the
appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus."56
The "Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come . . . Come, Lord Jesus!"'57
St. Thomas sums up the various aspects of sacramental signs:
"Therefore a sacrament is a sign that commemorates what precedes it -
Christ's Passion; demonstrates what is accomplished in us through
Christ's Passion - grace; and prefigures what that Passion pledges to us
- future glory."58

1131 The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ
and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us.
the visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and
make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in
those who receive them with the required dispositions.
1132 The Church celebrates the sacraments as a priestly community
structured by the baptismal priesthood and the priesthood of ordained
ministers.
1133 The Holy Spirit prepares the faithful for the sacraments by the
Word of God and the faith which welcomes that word in well-disposed
hearts. Thus the sacraments strengthen faith and express it.
1134 The fruit of sacramental life is both personal and ecclesial. For
every one of the faithful an the one hand, this fruit is life for God in
Christ Jesus; for the Church, on the other, it is an increase in charity
and in her mission of witness.

1135 The catechesis of the liturgy entails first of all an understanding
of the sacramental economy (Chapter One). In this light, the
innovation of its celebration is revealed. This chapter will therefore
treat of the celebration of the sacraments of the Church. It will
consider that which, through the diversity of liturgical traditions, is
common to the celebration of the seven sacraments. What is proper to
each will be treated later. This fundamental catechesis on the
sacramental celebrations responds to the first questions posed by the
faithful regarding this subject:
- Who celebrates the liturgy?
- How is the liturgy celebrated?
- When is the liturgy celebrated?
- Where is the liturgy celebrated?

Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY
I. Who Celebrates?
1136 Liturgy is an "action" of the whole Christ (Christus totus). Those
who even now celebrate it without signs are already in the heavenly
liturgy, where celebration is wholly communion and feast
The celebrants of the heavenly liturgy
1137 The book of Revelation of St. John, read in the Church's liturgy,
first reveals to us, "A throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the
throne": "the Lord God."1 It then shows the Lamb, "standing, as
though it had been slain": Christ crucified and risen, the one high
priest of the true sanctuary, the same one "who offers and is offered,
who gives and is given."2 Finally it presents "the river of the water of
life . . . flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb," one of most
beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit.3
1138 "Recapitulated in Christ," these are the ones who take part in the
service of the praise of God and the fulfillment of his plan: the
heavenly powers, all creation (the four living beings), the servants of
the Old and New Covenants (the twenty-four elders), the new People
of God (the one hundred and forty-four thousand),4 especially the
martyrs "slain for the word of God," and the all-holy Mother of God
(the Woman), the Bride of the Lamb,5 and finally "a great multitude
which no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes, and
peoples and tongues."6
1139 It is in this eternal liturgy that the Spirit and the Church enable
us to participate whenever we celebrate the mystery of salvation in the
sacraments.
The celebrants of the sacramental liturgy
1140 It is the whole community, the Body of Christ united with its
Head, that celebrates. "Liturgical services are not private functions but
are celebrations of the Church which is 'the sacrament of unity,'
namely, the holy people united and organized under the authority of
the bishops. Therefore, liturgical services pertain to the whole Body of
the Church. They manifest it, and have effects upon it. But they touch
individual members of the Church in different ways, depending on
their orders, their role in the liturgical services, and their actual
participation in them."7 For this reason, "rites which are meant to be
celebrated in common, with the faithful present and actively
participating, should as far as possible be celebrated in that way rather
than by an individual and quasi-privately."8
1141 The celebrating assembly is the community of the baptized who,
"by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated
to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, that through all the
works of Christian men they may offer spiritual sacrifices."9 This
"common priesthood" is that of Christ the sole priest, in which all his
members participate:10
Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to
that full, conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations
which is demanded by the very nature of the liturgy, and to which the
Christian people, "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
redeemed people," have a right and an obligation by reason of their
Baptism.11
1142 But "the members do not all have the same function."12 Certain
members are called by God, in and through the Church, to a special
service of the community. These servants are chosen and consecrated
by the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which the Holy Spirit enables
them to act in the person of Christ the head, for the service of all the
members of the Church.13 The ordained minister is, as it were, an
"icon" of Christ the priest. Since it is in the Eucharist that the
sacrament of the Church is made fully visible, it is in his presiding at
the Eucharist that the bishop's ministry is most evident, as well as, in
communion with him, the ministry of priests and deacons.
1143 For the purpose of assisting the work of the common priesthood
of the faithful, other particular ministries also exist, not consecrated by
the sacrament of Holy Orders; their functions are determined by the
bishops, in accord with liturgical traditions and pastoral needs.
"Servers, readers, commentators, and members of the choir also
exercise a genuine liturgical function."14
1144 In the celebration of the sacraments it is thus the whole assembly
that is leitourgos, each according to his function, but in the "unity of
the Spirit" who acts in all. "In liturgical celebrations each person,
minister or layman, who has an office to perform, should carry out all
and only those parts which pertain to his office by the nature of the rite
and the norms of the liturgy."15

II. How is the Liturgy Celebrated?
Signs and symbols
1145 A sacramental celebration is woven from signs and symbols. In
keeping with the divine pedagogy of salvation, their meaning is rooted
in the work of creation and in human culture, specified by the events of
the Old Covenant and fully revealed in the person and work of Christ.
1146 Signs of the human world. In human life, signs and symbols
occupy an important place. As a being at once body and spirit, man
expresses and perceives spiritual realities through physical signs and
symbols. As a social being, man needs signs and symbols to
communicate with others, through language, gestures, and actions. the
same holds true for his relationship with God.
1147 God speaks to man through the visible creation. the material
cosmos is so presented to man's intelligence that he can read there
traces of its Creator.16 Light and darkness, wind and fire, water and
earth, the tree and its fruit speak of God and symbolize both his
greatness and his nearness.
1148 Inasmuch as they are creatures, these perceptible realities can
become means of expressing the action of God who sanctifies men,
and the action of men who offer worship to God. the same is true of
signs and symbols taken from the social life of man: washing and
anointing, breaking bread and sharing the cup can express the
sanctifying presence of God and man's gratitude toward his Creator.
1149 The great religions of mankind witness, often impressively, to this
cosmic and symbolic meaning of religious rites. the liturgy of the
Church presupposes, integrates and sanctifies elements from creation
and human culture, conferring on them the dignity of signs of grace, of
the new creation in Jesus Christ.
1150 Signs of the covenant. the Chosen People received from God
distinctive signs and symbols that marked its liturgical life. These are
no longer solely celebrations of cosmic cycles and social gestures, but
signs of the covenant, symbols of God's mighty deeds for his people.
Among these liturgical signs from the Old Covenant are circumcision,
anointing and consecration of kings and priests, laying on of hands,
sacrifices, and above all the Passover. the Church sees in these signs a
prefiguring of the sacraments of the New Covenant.
1151 Signs taken up by Christ. In his preaching the Lord Jesus often
makes use of the signs of creation to make known the mysteries of the
Kingdom of God.17 He performs healings and illustrates his preaching
with physical signs or symbolic gestures.18 He gives new meaning to
the deeds and signs of the Old Covenant, above all to the Exodus and
the Passover,19 for he himself is the meaning of all these signs.
1152 Sacramental signs. Since Pentecost, it is through the sacramental
signs of his Church that the Holy Spirit carries on the work of
sanctification. the sacraments of the Church do not abolish but purify
and integrate all the richness of the signs and symbols of the cosmos
and of social life. Further, they fulfill the types and figures of the Old
Covenant, signify and make actively present the salvation wrought by
Christ, and prefigure and anticipate the glory of heaven. Words and
actions
1153 A sacramental celebration is a meeting of God's children with
their Father, in Christ and the Holy Spirit; this meeting takes the form
of a dialogue, through actions and words. Admittedly, the symbolic
actions are already a language, but the Word of God and the response
of faith have to accompany and give life to them, so that the seed of the
Kingdom can bear its fruit in good soil. the liturgical actions signify
what the Word of God expresses: both his free initiative and his
people's response of faith.
1154 The liturgy of the Word is an integral part of sacramental
celebrations. To nourish the faith of believers, the signs which
accompany the Word of God should be emphasized: the book of the
Word (a lectionary or a book of the Gospels), its veneration
(procession, incense, candles), the place of its proclamation (lectern or
ambo), its audible and intelligible reading, the minister's homily which
extends its proclamation, and the responses of the assembly
(acclamations, meditation psalms, litanies, and profession of faith).
1155 The liturgical word and action are inseparable both insofar as
they are signs and instruction and insofar as they accomplish what they
signify. When the Holy Spirit awakens faith, he not only gives an
understanding of the Word of God, but through the sacraments also
makes present the "wonders" of God which it proclaims. the Spirit
makes present and communicates the Father's work, fulfilled by the
beloved Son.
Singing and music
1156 "The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of
inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. the main
reason for this pre-eminence is that, as a combination of sacred music
and words, it forms a necessary or integral part of solemn liturgy."20
The composition and singing of inspired psalms, often accompanied
by musical instruments, were already closely linked to the liturgical
celebrations of the Old Covenant. the Church continues and develops
this tradition: "Address . . . one another in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your
heart." "He who sings prays twice."21
1157 Song and music fulfill their function as signs in a manner all the
more significant when they are "more closely connected . . . with the
liturgical action,"22 according to three principal criteria: beauty
expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly at
the designated moments, and the solemn character of the celebration.
In this way they participate in the purpose of the liturgical words and
actions: the glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful:23
How I wept, deeply moved by your hymns, songs, and the voices that
echoed through your Church! What emotion I experienced in them!
Those sounds flowed into my ears distilling the truth in my heart. A
feeling of devotion surged within me, and tears streamed down my face
- tears that did me good.24
1158 The harmony of signs (song, music, words, and actions) is all the
more expressive and fruitful when expressed in the cultural richness of
the People of God who celebrate.25 Hence "religious singing by the
faithful is to be intelligently fostered so that in devotions and sacred
exercises as well as in liturgical services," in conformity with the
Church's norms, "the voices of the faithful may be heard." But "the
texts intended to be sung must always be in conformity with Catholic
doctrine. Indeed they should be drawn chiefly from the Sacred
Scripture and from liturgical sources."26
Holy images
1159 The sacred image, the liturgical icon, principally represents
Christ. It cannot represent the invisible and incomprehensible God,
but the incarnation of the Son of God has ushered in a new "economy"
of images:
Previously God, who has neither a body nor a face, absolutely could
not be represented by an image. But now that he has made himself
visible in the flesh and has lived with men, I can make an image of
what I have seen of God . . . and contemplate the glory of the Lord, his
face unveiled.27
1160 Christian iconography expresses in images the same Gospel
message that Scripture communicates by words. Image and word
illuminate each other:
We declare that we preserve intact all the written and unwritten
traditions of the Church which have been entrusted to us. One of these
traditions consists in the production of representational artwork, which
accords with the history of the preaching of the Gospel. For it confirms
that the incarnation of the Word of God was real and not imaginary,
and to our benefit as well, for realities that illustrate each other
undoubtedly reflect each other's meaning.28
1161 All the signs in the liturgical celebrations are related to Christ: as
are sacred images of the holy Mother of God and of the saints as well.
They truly signify Christ, who is glorified in them. They make manifest
the "cloud of witnesses"29 who continue to participate in the salvation
of the world and to whom we are united, above all in sacramental
celebrations. Through their icons, it is man "in the image of God,"
finally transfigured "into his likeness,"30 who is revealed to our faith.
So too are the angels, who also are recapitulated in Christ:
Following the divinely inspired teaching of our holy Fathers and the
tradition of the Catholic Church (for we know that this tradition comes
from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her) we rightly define with full
certainty and correctness that, like the figure of the precious and life-
giving cross, venerable and holy images of our Lord and God and
Savior, Jesus Christ, our inviolate Lady, the holy Mother of God, and
the venerated angels, all the saints and the just, whether painted or
made of mosaic or another suitable material, are to be exhibited in the
holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and vestments, walls and
panels, in houses and on streets.31
1162 "The beauty of the images moves me to contemplation, as a
meadow delights the eyes and subtly infuses the soul with the glory of
God."32 Similarly, the contemplation of sacred icons, united with
meditation on the Word of God and the singing of liturgical hymns,
enters into the harmony of the signs of celebration so that the mystery
celebrated is imprinted in the heart's memory and is then expressed in
the new life of the faithful.

III. When is the Liturgy Celebrated?
Liturgical seasons
1163 "Holy Mother Church believes that she should celebrate the
saving work of her divine Spouse in a sacred commemoration on
certain days throughout the course of the year. Once each week, on the
day which she has called the Lord's Day, she keeps the memory of the
Lord's resurrection. She also celebrates it once every year, together
with his blessed Passion, at Easter, that most solemn of all feasts. In the
course of the year, moreover, she unfolds the whole mystery of Christ
.... Thus recalling the mysteries of the redemption, she opens up to the
faithful the riches of her Lord's powers and merits, so that these are in
some way made present in every age; the faithful lay hold of them and
are filled with saving grace."33
1164 From the time of the Mosaic law, the People of God have
observed fixed feasts, beginning with Passover, to commemorate the
astonishing actions of the Savior God, to give him thanks for them, to
perpetuate their remembrance, and to teach new generations to
conform their conduct to them. In the age of the Church, between the
Passover of Christ already accomplished once for all, and its
consummation in the kingdom of God, the liturgy celebrated on fixed
days bears the imprint of the newness of the mystery of Christ.
1165 When the Church celebrates the mystery of Christ, there is a
word that marks her prayer: "Today!" - a word echoing the prayer her
Lord taught her and the call of the Holy Spirit.34 This "today" of the
living God which man is called to enter is "the hour" of Jesus' Passover,
which reaches across and underlies all history:
Life extends over all beings and fills them with unlimited light; the
Orient of orients pervades the universe, and he who was "before the
daystar" and before the heavenly bodies, immortal and vast, the great
Christ, shines over all beings more brightly than the sun. Therefore a
day of long, eternal light is ushered in for us who believe in him, a day
which is never blotted out: the mystical Passover.35
The Lord's day
1166 "By a tradition handed down from the apostles which took its
origin from the very day of Christ's Resurrection, the Church
celebrates the Paschal mystery every seventh day, which day is
appropriately called the Lord's Day or Sunday."36 The day of Christ's
Resurrection is both the first day of the week, the memorial of the first
day of creation, and the "eighth day," on which Christ after his "rest"
on the great sabbath inaugurates the "day that the Lord has made," the
"day that knows no evening."37 The Lord's Supper is its center, for
there the whole community of the faithful encounters the risen Lord
who invites them to his banquet:38
The Lord's day, the day of Resurrection, the day of Christians, is our
day. It is called the Lord's day because on it the Lord rose victorious to
the Father. If pagans call it the "day of the sun," we willingly agree, for
today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice
with healing in his rays.39
1167 Sunday is the pre-eminent day for the liturgical assembly, when
the faithful gather "to listen to the word of God and take part in the
Eucharist, thus calling to mind the Passion, Resurrection, and glory of
the Lord Jesus, and giving thanks to God who 'has begotten them
again, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead' unto a living
hope":40
When we ponder, O Christ, the marvels accomplished on this day, the
Sunday of your holy resurrection, we say: "Blessed is Sunday, for on it
began creation . . . the world's salvation ... the renewal of the human
race .... On Sunday heaven and earth rejoiced and the whole universe
was filled with light. Blessed is Sunday, for on it were opened the gates
of paradise so that Adam and all the exiles might enter it without
fear.41
The liturgical year
1168 Beginning with the Easter Triduum as its source of light, the new
age of the Resurrection fills the whole liturgical year with its brilliance.
Gradually, on either side of this source, the year is transfigured by the
liturgy. It really is a "year of the Lord's favor."42 The economy of
salvation is at work within the framework of time, but since its
fulfillment in the Passover of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, the culmination of history is anticipated "as a foretaste," and the
kingdom of God enters into our time.
1169 Therefore Easter is not simply one feast among others, but the
"Feast of feasts," the "Solemnity of solemnities," just as the Eucharist is
the "Sacrament of sacraments" (the Great Sacrament). St. Athanasius
calls Easter "the Great Sunday"43 and the Eastern Churches call Holy
Week "the Great Week." the mystery of the Resurrection, in which
Christ crushed death, permeates with its powerful energy our old time,
until all is subjected to him.
1170 At the Council of Nicaea in 325, all the Churches agreed that
Easter, the Christian Passover, should be celebrated on the Sunday
following the first full moon (14 Nisan) after the vernal equinox.
Because of different methods of calculating the 14th day of the month
of Nisan, the date of Easter in the Western and Eastern Churches is
not always the same. For this reason, the Churches are seeking an
agreement in order once again to celebrate the day of the Lord's
Resurrection on a common date.
1171 In the liturgical year the various aspects of the one Paschal
mystery unfold. This is also the case with the cycle of feasts
surrounding the mystery of the incarnation (Annunciation, Christmas,
Epiphany). They commemorate the beginning of our salvation and
communicate to us the first fruits of the Paschal mystery.
The sanctoral in the liturgical year
1172 "In celebrating this annual cycle of the mysteries of Christ, Holy
Church honors the Blessed Mary, Mother of God, with a special love.
She is inseparably linked with the saving work of her Son. In her the
Church admires and exalts the most excellent fruit of redemption and
joyfully contemplates, as in a faultless image, that which she herself
desires and hopes wholly to be."44
1173 When the Church keeps the memorials of martyrs and other
saints during the annual cycle, she proclaims the Paschal mystery in
those "who have suffered and have been glorified with Christ. She
proposes them to the faithful as examples who draw all men to the
Father through Christ, and through their merits she begs for God's
favors."45
The Liturgy of the Hours
1174 The mystery of Christ, his Incarnation and Passover, which we
celebrate in the Eucharist especially at the Sunday assembly, permeates
and transfigures the time of each day, through the celebration of the
Liturgy of the Hours, "the divine office."46 This celebration, faithful to
the apostolic exhortations to "pray constantly," is "so devised that the
whole course of the day and night is made holy by the praise of
God."47 In this "public prayer of the Church,"48 The faithful (clergy,
religious, and lay people) exercise the royal priesthood of the baptized.
Celebrated in "the form approved" by the Church, the Liturgy of the
Hours "is truly the voice of the Bride herself addressed to her
Bridegroom. It is the very prayer which Christ himself together with
his Body addresses to the Father.49
1175 The Liturgy of the Hours is intended to become the prayer of the
whole People of God. In it Christ himself "continues his priestly work
through his Church."50 His members participate according to their
own place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives: priests
devoted to the pastoral ministry, because they are called to remain
diligent in prayer and the service of the word; religious, by the charism
of their consecrated lives; all the faithful as much as possible: "Pastors
of souls should see to it that the principal hours, especially Vespers, are
celebrated in common in church on Sundays and on the more solemn
feasts. the laity, too, are encouraged to recite the divine office, either
with the priests, or among themselves, or even individually."51
1176 The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours demands not only
harmonizing the voice with the praying heart, but also a deeper
"understanding of the liturgy and of the Bible, especially of the
Psalms."52
1177 The hymns and litanies of the Liturgy of the Hours integrate the
prayer of the psalms into the age of the Church, expressing the
symbolism of the time of day, the liturgical season, or the feast being
celebrated. Moreover, the reading from the Word of God at each Hour
(with the subsequent responses or troparia) and readings from the
Fathers and spiritual masters at certain Hours, reveal more deeply the
meaning of the mystery being celebrated, assist in understanding the
psalms, and prepare for silent prayer. the lectio divina, where the Word
of God is so read and meditated that it becomes prayer, is thus rooted
in the liturgical celebration.
1178 The Liturgy of the Hours, which is like an extension of the
Eucharistic celebration, does not exclude but rather in a
complementary way calls forth the various devotions of the People of
God, especially adoration and worship of the Blessed Sacrament.

IV. Where is the Liturgy Celebrated?
1179 The worship "in Spirit and in truth"53 of the New Covenant is
not tied exclusively to any one place. the whole earth is sacred and
entrusted to the children of men. What matters above all is that, when
the faithful assemble in the same place, they are the "living stones,"
gathered to be "built into a spiritual house."54 For the Body of the
risen Christ is the spiritual temple from which the source of living
water springs forth: incorporated into Christ by the Holy Spirit, "we
are the temple of the living God."55
1180 When the exercise of religious liberty is not thwarted,56
Christians construct buildings for divine worship. These visible
churches are not simply gathering places but signify and make visible
the Church living in this place, the dwelling of God with men
reconciled and united in Christ.
1181 A church, "a house of prayer in which the Eucharist is celebrated
and reserved, where the faithful assemble, and where is worshipped the
presence of the Son of God our Savior, offered for us on the sacrificial
altar for the help and consolation of the faithful - this house ought to
be in good taste and a worthy place for prayer and sacred
ceremonial."57 In this "house of God" the truth and the harmony of
the signs that make it up should show Christ to be present and active
in this place.58
1182 The altar of the New Covenant is the Lord's Cross,59 from
which the sacraments of the Paschal mystery flow. On the altar, which
is the center of the church, the sacrifice of the Cross is made present
under sacramental signs. the altar is also the table of the Lord, to
which the People of God are invited.60 In certain Eastern liturgies, the
altar is also the symbol of the tomb (Christ truly died and is truly
risen).
1183 The tabernacle is to be situated "in churches in a most worthy
place with the greatest honor."61 The dignity, placing, and security of
the Eucharistic tabernacle should foster adoration before the Lord
really present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.62
The sacred chrism (myron), used in anointings as the sacramental sign
of the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit, is traditionally reserved and
venerated in a secure place in the sanctuary. the oil of catechumens
and the oil of the sick may also be placed there.
1184 The chair of the bishop (cathedra) or the priest "should express
his office of presiding over the assembly and of directing prayer."63
The lectern (ambo): "The dignity of the Word of God requires the
church to have a suitable place for announcing his message so that the
attention of the people may be easily directed to that place during the
liturgy of the Word."64
1185 The gathering of the People of God begins with Baptism; a
church must have a place for the celebration of Baptism (baptistry)
and for fostering remembrance of the baptismal promises (holy water
font).
The renewal of the baptismal life requires penance. A church, then,
must lend itself to the expression of repentance and the reception of
forgiveness, which requires an appropriate place to receive penitents.
A church must also be a space that invites us to the recollection and
silent prayer that extend and internalize the great prayer of the
Eucharist.
1186 Finally, the church has an eschatological significance. To enter
into the house of God, we must cross a threshold, which symbolizes
passing from the world wounded by sin to the world of the new Life to
which all men are called. the visible church is a symbol of the Father's
house toward which the People of God is journeying and where the
Father "will wipe every tear from their eyes."65 Also for this reason, the
Church is the house of all God's children, open and welcoming.

CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENTAL CELEBRATION OF THE
PASCHAL MYSTERY




Article 1 CELEBRATING THE CHURCH'S LITURGY




IN BRIEF
1187 The liturgy is the work of the whole Christ, head and body. Our
high priest celebrates it unceasingly in the heavenly liturgy, with the
holy Mother of God, the apostles, all the saints, and the multitude of
those who have already entered the kingdom.


1188 In a liturgical celebration, the whole assembly is leitourgos, each
member according to his own function. the baptismal priesthood is
that of the whole Body of Christ. But some of the faithful are ordained
through the sacrament of Holy Orders to represent Christ as head of
the Body.
1189 The liturgical celebration involves signs and symbols relating to
creation (candles, water, fire), human life (washing, anointing,
breaking bread) and the history of salvation (the rites of the Passover).
Integrated into the world of faith and taken up by the power of the
Holy Spirit, these cosmic elements, human rituals, and gestures of
remembrance of God become bearers of the saving and sanctifying
action of Christ.
1190 The Liturgy of the Word is an integral part of the celebration. the
meaning of the celebration is expressed by the Word of God which is
proclaimed and by the response of faith to it.
1191 Song and music are closely connected with the liturgical action.
the criteria for their proper use are the beauty expressive of prayer, the
unanimous participation of the assembly, and the sacred character of
the celebration.
1192 Sacred images in our churches and homes are intended to
awaken and nourish our faith in the mystery of Christ. Through the
icon of Christ and his works of salvation, it is he whom we adore.
Through sacred images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and
of the saints, we venerate the persons represented.
1193 Sunday, the "Lord's Day," is the principal day for the celebration
of the Eucharist because it is the day of the Resurrection. It is the pre-
eminent day of the liturgical assembly, the day of the Christian family,
and the day of joy and rest from work. Sunday is "the foundation and
kernel of the whole liturgical year" (SC 106).
1194 The Church, "in the course of the year, . . . unfolds the whole
mystery of Christ from his Incarnation and Nativity through his
Ascension, to Pentecost and the expectation of the blessed hope of the
coming of the Lord" (SC 102 # 2).
1195 By keeping the memorials of the saints - first of all the holy
Mother of God, then the apostles, the martyrs, and other saints - on
fixed days of the liturgical year, the Church on earth shows that she is
united with the liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to Christ for having
accomplished his salvation in his glorified members; their example
encourages her on her way to the Father.
1196 The faithful who celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are united to
Christ our high priest, by the prayer of the Psalms, meditation on the
Word of God, and canticles and blessings, in order to be joined with
his unceasing and universal prayer that gives glory to the Father and
implores the gift of the Holy Spirit on the whole world.
1197 Christ is the true temple of God, "the place where his glory
dwells"; by the grace of God, Christians also become the temples of the
Holy Spirit, living stones out of which the Church is built.
1198 In its earthly state the Church needs places where the
community can gather together. Our visible churches, holy places, are
images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which we are
making our way on pilgrimage.
1199 It is in these churches that the Church celebrates public worship
to the glory of the Holy Trinity, hears the word of God and sings his
praise, lifts up her prayer, and offers the sacrifice of Christ
sacramentally present in the midst of the assembly. These churches are
also places of recollection and personal prayer.

Article 2 LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE UNITY OF THE
MYSTERY
Liturgical traditions and the catholicity of the Church
1200 From the first community of Jerusalem until the parousia, it is
the same Paschal mystery that the Churches of God, faithful to the
apostolic faith, celebrate in every place. the mystery celebrated in the
liturgy is one, but the forms of its celebration are diverse.
1201 The mystery of Christ is so unfathomably rich that it cannot be
exhausted by its expression in any single liturgical tradition. the history
of the blossoming and development of these rites witnesses to a
remarkable complementarity. When the Churches lived their respective
liturgical traditions in the communion of the faith and the sacraments
of the faith, they enriched one another and grew in fidelity to Tradition
and to the common mission of the whole Church.66
1202 The diverse liturgical traditions have arisen by very reason of the
Church's mission. Churches of the same geographical and cultural area
came to celebrate the mystery of Christ through particular expressions
characterized by the culture: in the tradition of the "deposit of faith,"67
in liturgical symbolism, in the organization of fraternal communion, in
the theological understanding of the mysteries, and in various forms of
holiness. Through the liturgical life of a local church, Christ, the light
and salvation of all peoples, is made manifest to the particular people
and culture to which that Church is sent and in which she is rooted.
the Church is catholic, capable of integrating into her unity, while
purifying them, all the authentic riches of cultures.68
1203 The liturgical traditions or rites presently in use in the Church
are the Latin (principally the Roman rite, but also the rites of certain
local churches, such as the Ambrosian rite, or those of certain religious
orders) and the Byzantine, Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac, Armenian,
Maronite and Chaldean rites. In "faithful obedience to tradition, the
sacred Council declares that Holy Mother Church holds all lawfully
recognized rites to be of equal right and dignity, and that she wishes to
preserve them in the future and to foster them in every way."69
Liturgy and culture
1204 The celebration of the liturgy, therefore, should correspond to the
genius and culture of the different peoples.70 In order that the mystery
of Christ be "made known to all the nations . . . to bring about the
obedience of faith,"71 it must be proclaimed, celebrated, and lived in
all cultures in such a way that they themselves are not abolished by it,
but redeemed and fulfilled:72 It is with and through their own human
culture, assumed and transfigured by Christ, that the multitude of
God's children has access to the Father, in order to glorify him in the
one Spirit.
1205 "In the liturgy, above all that of the sacraments, there is an
immutable part, a part that is divinely instituted and of which the
Church is the guardian, and parts that can be changed, which the
Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the
cultures of recently evangelized peoples."73
1206 "Liturgical diversity can be a source of enrichment, but it can
also provoke tensions, mutual misunderstandings, and even schisms. In
this matter it is clear that diversity must not damage unity. It must
express only fidelity to the common faith, to the sacramental signs that
the Church has received from Christ, and to hierarchical communion.
Cultural adaptation also requires a conversion of heart and even, where
necessary, a breaking with ancestral customs incompatible with the
Catholic faith."74

Article 2 LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE UNITY OF THE
MYSTERY
IN BRIEF
1207 It is fitting that liturgical celebration tends to express itself in the
culture of the people where the Church finds herself, though without
being submissive to it. Moreover, the liturgy itself generates cultures
and shapes them.
1208 The diverse liturgical traditions or rites, legitimately recognized,
manifest the catholicity of the Church, because they signify and
communicate the same mystery of Christ.
1209 The criterion that assures unity amid the diversity of liturgical
traditions is fidelity to apostolic Tradition, i e., the communion in the
faith and the sacraments received from the apostles, a communion that
is both signified and guaranteed by apostolic succession.

SECTION TWO THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH
SECTION TWO THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH
1210 Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven:
Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the
Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. the seven
sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of
Christian life:1 they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the
Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between
the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.
1211 Following this analogy, the first chapter will expound the three
sacraments of Christian initiation; the second, the sacraments of
healing; and the third, the sacraments at the service of communion and
the mission of the faithful. This order, while not the only one possible,
does allow one to see that the sacraments form an organic whole in
which each particular sacrament has its own vital place. In this organic
whole, the Eucharist occupies a unique place as the "Sacrament of
sacraments": "all the other sacraments are ordered to it as to their
end."2

CHAPTER ONE THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN
INITIATION
1212 The sacraments of Christian initiation - Baptism, Confirmation,
and the Eucharist - lay the foundations of every Christian life. "The
sharing in the divine nature given to men through the grace of Christ
bears a certain likeness to the origin, development, and nourishing of
natural life. the faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the
sacrament of Confirmation, and receive in the Eucharist the food of
eternal life. By means of these sacraments of Christian initiation, they
thus receive in increasing measure the treasures of the divine life and
advance toward the perfection of charity."3

Article 1 THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM
1213 Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway
to life in the Spirit (vitae spiritualis ianua),4 and the door which gives
access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we are freed from sin
and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are
incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission:
"Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration through water in the
word."5

I. What is This Sacrament Called?
1214 This sacrament is called Baptism, after the central rite by which it
is carried out: to baptize (Greek baptizein) means to "plunge" or
"immerse"; the "plunge" into the water symbolizes the catechumen's
burial into Christ's death, from which he rises up by resurrection with
him, as "a new creature."6
1215 This sacrament is also called "the washing of regeneration and
renewal by the Holy Spirit," for it signifies and actually brings about
the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one "can enter the
kingdom of God."7
1216 "This bath is called enlightenment, because those who receive
this [catechetical] instruction are enlightened in their understanding
. . . ."8 Having received in Baptism the Word, "the true light that
enlightens every man," the person baptized has been "enlightened," he
becomes a "son of light," indeed, he becomes "light" himself:9
Baptism is God's most beautiful and magnificent gift....We call it gift,
grace, anointing, enlightenment, garment of immortality, bath of
rebirth, seal, and most precious gift. It is called gift because it is
conferred on those who bring nothing of their own; grace since it is
given even to the guilty; Baptism because sin is buried in the water;
anointing for it is priestly and royal as are those who are anointed;
enlightenment because it radiates light; clothing since it veils our
shame; bath because it washes; and seal as it is our guard and the sign
of God's Lordship.10

II. Baptism in the Economy of Salvation
Prefigurations of Baptism in the Old Covenant
1217 In the liturgy of the Easter Vigil, during the blessing of the
baptismal water, the Church solemnly commemorates the great events
in salvation history that already prefigured the mystery of Baptism:
Father, you give us grace through sacramental signs which tell us of the
wonders of your unseen power.


In Baptism we use your gift of water, which you have made a rich
symbol of the grace you give us in this sacrament.11
1218 Since the beginning of the world, water, so humble and
wonderful a creature, has been the source of life and fruitfulness.
Sacred Scripture sees it as "oveshadowed" by the Spirit of God:12
At the very dawn of creation
your Spirit breathed on the waters,
making them the wellspring of all holiness.13
1219 The Church has seen in Noah's ark a prefiguring of salvation by
Baptism, for by it "a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through
water":14
The waters of the great flood
you made a sign of the waters of Baptism,
that make an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness.15
1220 If water springing up from the earth symbolizes life, the water of
the sea is a symbol of death and so can represent the mystery of the
cross. By this symbolism Baptism signifies communion with Christ's
death.
1221 But above all, the crossing of the Red Sea, literally the liberation
of Israel from the slavery of Egypt, announces the liberation wrought
by Baptism:
You freed the children of Abraham from the slavery of Pharaoh,
bringing them dry-shod through the waters of the Red Sea,
to be an image of the people set free in Baptism.16
1222 Finally, Baptism is prefigured in the crossing of the Jordan River
by which the People of God received the gift of the land promised to
Abraham's descendants, an image of eternal life. the promise of this
blessed inheritance is fulfilled in the New Covenant.
Christ's Baptism
1223 All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in
Christ Jesus. He begins his public life after having himself baptized by
St. John the Baptist in the Jordan.17 After his resurrection Christ gives
this mission to his apostles: "Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
you."18
1224 Our Lord voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of St.
John, intended for sinners, in order to "fulfill all righteousness."19
Jesus' gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying.20 The Spirit who
had hovered over the waters of the first creation descended then on the
Christ as a prelude of the new creation, and the Father revealed Jesus
as his "beloved Son."21
1225 In his Passover Christ opened to all men the fountain of Baptism.
He had already spoken of his Passion, which he was about to suffer in
Jerusalem, as a "Baptism" with which he had to be baptized.22 The
blood and water that flowed from the pierced side of the crucified Jesus
are types of Baptism and the Eucharist, the sacraments of new life.23
From then on, it is possible "to be born of water and the Spirit"24 in
order to enter the Kingdom of God.
See where you are baptized, see where Baptism comes from, if not
from the cross of Christ, from his death. There is the whole mystery: he
died for you. In him you are redeemed, in him you are saved.25
Baptism in the Church
1226 From the very day of Pentecost the Church has celebrated and
administered holy Baptism. Indeed St. Peter declares to the crowd
astounded by his preaching: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you
in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you
shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."26 The apostles and their
collaborators offer Baptism to anyone who believed in Jesus: Jews, the
God-fearing, pagans.27 Always, Baptism is seen as connected with
faith: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your
household," St. Paul declared to his jailer in Philippi. and the narrative
continues, the jailer "was baptized at once, with all his family."28
1227 According to the Apostle Paul, the believer enters through
Baptism into communion with Christ's death, is buried with him, and
rises with him:
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him
by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.29
The baptized have "put on Christ."30 Through the Holy Spirit,
Baptism is a bath that purifies, justifies, and sanctifies.31
1228 Hence Baptism is a bath of water in which the "imperishable
seed" of the Word of God produces its life-giving effect.32 St.
Augustine says of Baptism: "The word is brought to the material
element, and it becomes a sacrament."33

III. How is the Sacrament of Baptism Celebrated?
Christian Initiation
1229 From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has been
accomplished by a journey and initiation in several stages. This journey
can be covered rapidly or slowly, but certain essential elements will
always have to be present: proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the
Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic
communion.
1230 This initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according
to circumstances. In the first centuries of the Church, Christian
initiation saw considerable development. A long period of
catechumenate included a series of preparatory rites, which were
liturgical landmarks along the path of catechumenal preparation and
culminated in the celebration of the sacraments of Christian initiation.
1231 Where infant Baptism has become the form in which this
sacrament is usually celebrated, it has become a single act
encapsulating the preparatory stages of Christian initiation in a very
abridged way. By its very nature infant Baptism requires a post-
baptismal catechumenate. Not only is there a need for instruction after
Baptism, but also for the necessary flowering of baptismal grace in
personal growth. the catechism has its proper place here.
1232 The second Vatican Council restored for the Latin Church "the
catechumenate for adults, comprising several distinct steps."34 The
rites for these stages are to be found in the Rite of Christian Initiation
of Adults (RCIA).35 The Council also gives permission that: "In
mission countries, in addition to what is furnished by the Christian
tradition, those elements of initiation rites may be admitted which are
already in use among some peoples insofar as they can be adapted to
the Christian ritual."36
1233 Today in all the rites, Latin and Eastern, the Christian initiation
of adults begins with their entry into the catechumenate and reaches
its culmination in a single celebration of the three sacraments of
initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.37 In the Eastern
rites the Christian initiation of infants also begins with Baptism
followed immediately by Confirmation and the Eucharist, while in the
Roman rite it is followed by years of catechesis before being completed
later by Confirmation and the Eucharist, the summit of their Christian
initiation.38
The mystagogy of the celebration
1234 The meaning and grace of the sacrament of Baptism are clearly
seen in the rites of its celebration. By following the gestures and words
of this celebration with attentive participation, the faithful are initiated
into the riches this sacrament signifies and actually brings about in
each newly baptized person.
1235 The sign of the cross, on the threshold of the celebration, marks
with the imprint of Christ the one who is going to belong to him and
signifies the grace of the redemption Christ won for us by his cross.
1236 The proclamation of the Word of God enlightens the candidates
and the assembly with the revealed truth and elicits the response of
faith, which is inseparable from Baptism. Indeed Baptism is "the
sacrament of faith" in a particular way, since it is the sacramental entry
into the life of faith.
1237 Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator
the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate.
the celebrant then anoints him with the oil of catechumens, or lays his
hands on him, and he explicitly renounces Satan. Thus prepared, he is
able to confess the faith of the Church, to which he will be "entrusted"
by Baptism.39
1238 The baptismal water is consecrated by a prayer of epiclesis (either
at this moment or at the Easter Vigil). the Church asks God that
through his Son the power of the Holy Spirit may be sent upon the
water, so that those who will be baptized in it may be "born of water
and the Spirit."40
1239 The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly
speaking. It signifies and actually brings about death to sin and entry
into the life of the Most Holy Trinity through configuration to the
Paschal mystery of Christ. Baptism is performed in the most expressive
way by triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient
times it has also been able to be conferred by pouring the water three
times over the candidate's head.
1240 In the Latin Church this triple infusion is accompanied by the
minister's words: "N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." In the Eastern liturgies the
catechumen turns toward the East and the priest says: "The servant of
God, N., is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit." At the invocation of each person of the Most Holy
Trinity, the priest immerses the candidate in the water and raises him
up again.
1241 The anointing with sacred chrism, perfumed oil consecrated by
the bishop, signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit to the newly baptized,
who has become a Christian, that is, one "anointed" by the Holy Spirit,
incorporated into Christ who is anointed priest, prophet, and king.41
1242 In the liturgy of the Eastern Churches, the post-baptismal
anointing is the sacrament of Chrismation (Confirmation). In the
Roman liturgy the post-baptismal anointing announces a second
anointing with sacred chrism to be conferred later by the bishop
Confirmation, which will as it were "confirm" and complete the
baptismal anointing.
1243 The white garment symbolizes that the person baptized has "put
on Christ,"42 has risen with Christ. the candle, lit from the Easter
candle, signifies that Christ has enlightened the neophyte. In him the
baptized are "the light of the world."43
The newly baptized is now, in the only Son, a child of God entitled to
say the prayer of the children of God: "Our Father."
1244 First Holy Communion. Having become a child of God clothed
with the wedding garment, the neophyte is admitted "to the marriage
supper of the Lamb"44 and receives the food of the new life, the body
and blood of Christ. the Eastern Churches maintain a lively awareness
of the unity of Christian initiation by giving Holy Communion to all
the newly baptized and confirmed, even little children, recalling the
Lord's words: "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them."45
The Latin Church, which reserves admission to Holy Communion to
those who have attained the age of reason, expresses the orientation of
Baptism to the Eucharist by having the newly baptized child brought
to the altar for the praying of the Our Father.
1245 The solemn blessing concludes the celebration of Baptism. At the
Baptism of newborns the blessing of the mother occupies a special
place.

IV. Who can Receive Baptism?
1246 "Every person not yet baptized and only such a person is able to
be baptized."46
The Baptism of adults
1247 Since the beginning of the Church, adult Baptism is the common
practice where the proclamation of the Gospel is still new. the
catechumenate (preparation for Baptism) therefore occupies an
important place. This initiation into Christian faith and life should
dispose the catechumen to receive the gift of God in Baptism,
Confirmation, and the Eucharist.
1248 The catechumenate, or formation of catechumens, aims at
bringing their conversion and faith to maturity, in response to the
divine initiative and in union with an ecclesial community. the
catechumenate is to be "a formation in the whole Christian life . . .
during which the disciples will be joined to Christ their teacher. the
catechumens should be properly initiated into the mystery of salvation
and the practice of the evangelical virtues, and they should be
introduced into the life of faith, liturgy, and charity of the People of
God by successive sacred rites."47
1249 Catechumens "are already joined to the Church, they are already
of the household of Christ, and are quite frequently already living a life
of faith, hope, and charity."48 "With love and solicitude mother
Church already embraces them as her own."49
The Baptism of infants
1250 Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin,
children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from
the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the
children of God, to which all men are called.50 The sheer
gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly manifest in infant
Baptism. the Church and the parents would deny a child the priceless
grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism
shortly after birth.51
1251 Christian parents will recognize that this practice also accords
with their role as nurturers of the life that God has entrusted to
them.52
1252 The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the
Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second
century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the
apostolic preaching, when whole "households" received baptism,
infants may also have been baptized.53
Faith and Baptism
1253 Baptism is the sacrament of faith.54 But faith needs the
community of believers. It is only within the faith of the Church that
each of the faithful can believe. the faith required for Baptism is not a
perfect and mature faith, but a beginning that is called to develop. the
catechumen or the godparent is asked: "What do you ask of God's
Church?" the response is: "Faith!"
1254 For all the baptized, children or adults, faith must grow after
Baptism. For this reason the Church celebrates each year at the Easter
Vigil the renewal of baptismal promises. Preparation for Baptism leads
only to the threshold of new life. Baptism is the source of that new life
in Christ from which the entire Christian life springs forth.
1255 For the grace of Baptism to unfold, the parents' help is
important. So too is the role of the godfather and godmother, who
must be firm believers, able and ready to help the newly baptized -
child or adult on the road of Christian life.55 Their task is a truly
ecclesial function (officium).56 The whole ecclesial community bears
some responsibility for the development and safeguarding of the grace
given at Baptism.

V. Who can Baptize?
1256 The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and,
in the Latin Church, also the deacon.57 In case of necessity, anyone,
even a not-baptized person, with the required intention, can
baptize.57B , by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention
required is to will to do what the Church does when she baptizes. The
Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal saving will
of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.58

VI. The Necessity of Baptism
1257 The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for
salvation.59 He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to
all nations and to baptize them.60 Baptism is necessary for salvation
for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had
the possibility of asking for this sacrament.61 The Church does not
know of any means other than Baptism that assures entry into eternal
beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has
received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are "reborn
of water and the Spirit." God has bound salvation to the sacrament of
Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments.
1258 The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who
suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism
are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood,
like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without
being a sacrament.
1259 For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit
desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity,
assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through
the sacrament.
1260 "Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to
one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy
Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way
known to God, of the Paschal mystery."62 Every man who is ignorant
of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does
the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be
saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired
Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity.
1261 As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church
can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral
rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men
should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused
him to say: "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,"63
allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have
died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to
prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy
Baptism.

VII. The Grace of Baptism
1262 The different effects of Baptism are signified by the perceptible
elements of the sacramental rite. Immersion in water symbolizes not
only death and purification, but also regeneration and renewal. Thus
the two principal effects are purification from sins and new birth in the
Holy Spirit.64
For the forgiveness of sins . . .
1263 By Baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins,
as well as all punishment for sin.65 In those who have been reborn
nothing remains that would impede their entry into the Kingdom of
God, neither Adam's sin, nor personal sin, nor the consequences of sin,
the gravest of which is separation from God.
1264 Yet certain temporal consequences of sin remain in the baptized,
such as suffering, illness, death, and such frailties inherent in life as
weaknesses of character, and so on, as well as an inclination to sin that
Tradition calls concupiscence, or metaphorically, "the tinder for sin"
(fomes peccati); since concupiscence "is left for us to wrestle with, it
cannot harm those who do not consent but manfully resist it by the
grace of Jesus Christ."66 Indeed, "an athlete is not crowned unless he
competes according to the rules."67
"A new creature"
1265 Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the
neophyte "a new creature," an adopted son of God, who has become a
"partaker of the divine nature,"68 member of Christ and coheir with
him,69 and a temple of the Holy Spirit.70
1266 The Most Holy Trinity gives the baptized sanctifying grace, the
grace of justification:
- enabling them to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him
through the theological virtues;
- giving them the power to live and act under the prompting of the
Holy Spirit through the gifts of the Holy Spirit;
- allowing them to grow in goodness through the moral virtues.
Thus the whole organism of the Christian's supernatural life has its
roots in Baptism.
Incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ
1267 Baptism makes us members of the Body of Christ: "Therefore . .
. we are members one of another."71 Baptism incorporates us into the
Church. From the baptismal fonts is born the one People of God of
the New Covenant, which transcends all the natural or human limits of
nations, cultures, races, and sexes: "For by one Spirit we were all
baptized into one body."72
1268 The baptized have become "living stones" to be "built into a
spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood."73 By Baptism they share in
the priesthood of Christ, in his prophetic and royal mission. They are
"a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people,
that [they] may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called [them]
out of darkness into his marvelous light."74 Baptism gives a share in
the common priesthood of all believers.
1269 Having become a member of the Church, the person baptized
belongs no longer to himself, but to him who died and rose for us.75
From now on, he is called to be subject to others, to serve them in the
communion of the Church, and to "obey and submit" to the Church's
leaders,76 holding them in respect and affection.77 Just as Baptism is
the source of responsibilities and duties, the baptized person also
enjoys rights within the Church: to receive the sacraments, to be
nourished with the Word of God and to be sustained by the other
spiritual helps of the Church.78
1270 "Reborn as sons of God, [the baptized] must profess before men
the faith they have received from God through the Church" and
participate in the apostolic and missionary activity of the People of
God.79
The sacramental bond of the unity of Christians
1271 Baptism constitutes the foundation of communion among all
Christians, including those who are not yet in full communion with the
Catholic Church: "For men who believe in Christ and have been
properly baptized are put in some, though imperfect, communion with
the Catholic Church. Justified by faith in Baptism, [they] are
incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called
Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers by the
children of the Catholic Church."80 "Baptism therefore constitutes the
sacramental bond of unity existing among all who through it are
reborn."81
An indelible spiritual mark . . .
1272 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is
configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible
spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase
this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of
salvation.82 Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated.
1273 Incorporated into the Church by Baptism, the faithful have
received the sacramental character that consecrates them for Christian
religious worship.83 The baptismal seal enables and commits
Christians to serve God by a vital participation in the holy liturgy of
the Church and to exercise their baptismal priesthood by the witness
of holy lives and practical charity.84
1274 The Holy Spirit has marked us with the seal of the Lord
("Dominicus character") "for the day of redemption."85 "Baptism
indeed is the seal of eternal life."86 The faithful Christian who has
"kept the seal" until the end, remaining faithful to the demands of his
Baptism, will be able to depart this life "marked with the sign of
faith,"87 with his baptismal faith, in expectation of the blessed vision
of God - the consummation of faith - and in the hope of resurrection.

Article 1 THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM




IN BRIEF
1275 Christian initiation is accomplished by three sacraments together:
Baptism which is the beginning of new life; Confirmation which is its
strengthening; and the Eucharist which nourishes the disciple with
Christ's Body and Blood for his transformation in Christ.
1276 "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching
them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Mt 28:19-20).
1277 Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accordance with
the Lord's will, it is necessary for salvation, as is the Church herself,
which we enter by Baptism.
1278 The essential rite of Baptism consists in immersing the candidate
in water or pouring water on his head, while pronouncing the
invocation of the Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit.
1279 The fruit of Baptism, or baptismal grace, is a rich reality that
includes forgiveness of original sin and all personal sins, birth into the
new life by which man becomes an adoptive son of the Father, a
member of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit. By this very fact the
person baptized is incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ,
and made a sharer in the priesthood of Christ.
1280 Baptism imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign, the
character, which consecrates the baptized person for Christian
worship. Because of the character Baptism cannot be repeated (cf. DS
1609 and DS 1624).
1281 Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all
those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the
inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can
be saved if they have not been baptized (cf. LG 16).
1282 Since the earliest times, Baptism has been administered to
children, for it is a grace and a gift of God that does not presuppose
any human merit; children are baptized in the faith of the Church.
Entry into Christian life gives access to true freedom.
1283 With respect to children who have died without Baptism, the
liturgy of the Church invites us to trust in God's mercy and to pray for
their salvation.
1284 In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have
the intention of doing that which the Church does and provided that
he pours water on the candidate's head while saying: "I baptize you in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

Article 2 THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION
1285 Baptism, the Eucharist, and the sacrament of Confirmation
together constitute the "sacraments of Christian initiation," whose
unity must be safeguarded. It must be explained to the faithful that the
reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the
completion of baptismal grace.88 For "by the sacrament of
Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church
and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they
are, as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and
defend the faith by word and deed."89

I. Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation
1286 In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of
the Lord would rest on the hoped-for Messiah for his saving
mission.90 The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism by
John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the
Son of God.91 He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; his whole life and
his whole mission are carried out in total communion with the Holy
Spirit whom the Father gives him "without measure."92
1287 This fullness of the Spirit was not to remain uniquely the
Messiah's, but was to be communicated to the whole messianic
people.93 On several occasions Christ promised this outpouring of the
Spirit,94 a promise which he fulfilled first on Easter Sunday and then
more strikingly at Pentecost.95 Filled with the Holy Spirit the apostles
began to proclaim "the mighty works of God," and Peter declared this
outpouring of the Spirit to be the sign of the messianic age.96 Those
who believed in the apostolic preaching and were baptized received the
gift of the Holy Spirit in their turn.97
1288 "From that time on the apostles, in fulfillment of Christ's will,
imparted to the newly baptized by the laying on of hands the gift of the
Spirit that completes the grace of Baptism. For this reason in the
Letter to the Hebrews the doctrine concerning Baptism and the laying
on of hands is listed among the first elements of Christian instruction.
the imposition of hands is rightly recognized by the Catholic tradition
as the origin of the sacrament of Confirmation, which in a certain way
perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the Church."98
1289 Very early, the better to signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, an
anointing with perfumed oil (chrism) was added to the laying on of
hands. This anointing highlights the name "Christian," which means
"anointed" and derives from that of Christ himself whom God
"anointed with the Holy Spirit."99 This rite of anointing has continued
ever since, in both East and West. For this reason the Eastern Churches
call this sacrament Chrismation, anointing with chrism, or myron
which means "chrism." In the West, Confirmation suggests that this
sacrament both confirms Baptism and strengthens baptismal gracet.
Two traditions: East and West
1290 In the first centuries Confirmation generally comprised one
single celebration with Baptism, forming with it a "double sacrament,"
according to the expression of St. Cyprian. Among other reasons, the
multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year, the increase of
rural parishes, and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop
from being present at all baptismal celebrations. In the West the desire
to reserve the completion of Baptism to the bishop caused the
temporal separation of the two sacraments. the East has kept them
united, so that Confirmation is conferred by the priest who baptizes.
But he can do so only with the "myron" consecrated by a bishop.100
1291 A custom of the Roman Church facilitated the development of
the Western practice: a double anointing with sacred chrism after
Baptism. the first anointing of the neophyte on coming out of the
baptismal bath was performed by the priest; it was completed by a
second anointing on the forehead of the newly baptized by the
bishop.101 The first anointing with sacred chrism, by the priest, has
remained attached to the baptismal rite; it signifies the participation of
the one baptized in the prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ.
If Baptism is conferred on an adult, there is only one post-baptismal
anointing, that of Confirmation.
1292 The practice of the Eastern Churches gives greater emphasis to
the unity of Christian initiation. That of the Latin Church more clearly
expresses the communion of the new Christian with the bishop as
guarantor and servant of the unity, catholicity and apostolicity of his
Church, and hence the connection with the apostolic origins of
Christ's Church.

II. The Signs and the Rite of Confirmation
1293 In treating the rite of Confirmation, it is fitting to consider the
sign of anointing and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal.
Anointing, in Biblical and other ancient symbolism, is rich in meaning:
oil is a sign of abundance and joy;102 it cleanses (anointing before and
after a bath) and limbers (the anointing of athletes and wrestlers); oil is
a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds;103 and it
makes radiant with beauty, health, and strength.
1294 Anointing with oil has all these meanings in the sacramental life.
the pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens signifies
cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick expresses healing
and comfort. the post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in
Confirmation and ordination is the sign of consecration. By
Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are anointed, share more
completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy
Spirit with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off "the aroma
of Christ."104
1295 By this anointing the confirmand receives the "mark," the seal of
the Holy Spirit. A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal
authority, or ownership of an oblect.105 Hence soldiers were marked
with their leader's seal and slaves with their master's. A seal
authenticates a juridical act or document and occasionally makes it
secret.106
1296 Christ himself declared that he was marked with his Father's
seal.107 Christians are also marked with a seal: "It is God who
establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put
his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee."108
This seal of the Holy Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our
enrollment in his service for ever, as well as the promise of divine
protection in the great eschatological trial.109
The celebration of Confirmation
1297 The consecration of the sacred chrism is an important action that
precedes the celebration of Confirmation, but is in a certain way a part
of it. It is the bishop who, in the course of the Chrism Mass of Holy
Thursday, consecrates the sacred chrism for his whole diocese. In some
Eastern Churches this consecration is even reserved to the patriarch:
The liturgy of Antioch expresses the epiclesis for the consecration of
the sacred chrism (myron) in this way: "[Father . . . send your Holy
Spirit] on us and on this oil which is before us and consecrate it, so
that it may be for all who are anointed and marked with it holy myron,
priestly myron, royal myron, anointing with gladness, clothing with
light, a cloak of salvation, a spiritual gift, the sanctification of souls and
bodies, imperishable happiness, the indelible seal, a buckler of faith,
and a fearsome helmet against all the works of the adversary."
1298 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, as is
the case in the Roman Rite, the Liturgy of Confirmation begins with
the renewal of baptismal promises and the profession of faith by the
confirmands. This clearly shows that Confirmation follows
Baptism.110 When adults are baptized, they immediately receive
Confirmation and participate in the Eucharist.111
1299 In the Roman Rite the bishop extends his hands over the whole
group of the confirmands. Since the time of the apostles this gesture
has signified the gift of the Spirit. the bishop invokes the outpouring of
the Spirit in these words:
All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by water and the Holy Spirit
you freed your sons and daughters from sin
and gave them new life.
Send your Holy Spirit upon them
to be their helper and guide.
Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of right judgment and courage,
the spirit of knowledge and reverence.
Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.112
1300 The essential rite of the sacrament follows. In the Latin rite, "the
sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing with
chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the hand,
and through the words: Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti [Be
sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.]."113 In the Eastern Churches,
after a prayer of epiclesis the more significant parts of the body are
anointed with myron: forehead, eyes, nose, ears, lips, chest, back,
hands, and feet. Each anointing is accompanied by the formula:
GND"(4H *TNg"H A<gb:"J@H !(4@b(Signaculum doni Spiritus
Sancti): "The seal of the gift that is the Holy Spirit."113B
1301 The sign of peace that concludes the rite of the sacrament
signifies and demonstrates ecclesial communion with the bishop and
with all the faithful.114

III. The Effects of Confirmation
1302 It is evident from its celebration that the effect of the sacrament
of Confirmation is the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once
granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost.
1303 From this fact, Confirmation brings an increase and deepening
of baptismal grace:
- it roots us more deeply in the divine filiation which makes us cry,
"Abba! Father!";115
- it unites us more firmly to Christ;
- it increases the gifts of the Holy Spirit in us;
- it renders our bond with the Church more perfect;116
- it gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and defend
the faith by word and action as true witnesses of Christ, to confess the
name of Christ boldly, and never to be ashamed of the Cross:117
Recall then that you have received the spiritual seal, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of right judgment and courage,
the spirit of knowledge and reverence, the spirit of holy fear in God's
presence. Guard what you have received. God the Father has marked
you with his sign; Christ the Lord has confirmed you and has placed
his pledge, the Spirit, in your hearts.118
1304 Like Baptism which it completes, Confirmation is given only
once, for it too imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark, the
"character," which is the sign that Jesus Christ has marked a Christian
with the seal of his Spirit by clothing him with power from on high so
that he may be his witness.119
1305 This "character" perfects the common priesthood of the faithful,
received in Baptism, and "the confirmed person receives the power to
profess faith in Christ publicly and as it were officially (quasi ex
officio)."12

IV. Who can Receive This Sacrament?
1306 Every baptized person not yet confirmed can and should receive
the sacrament of Confirmation.121 Since Baptism, Confirmation, and
Eucharist form a unity, it follows that "the faithful are obliged to
receive this sacrament at the appropriate time,"122 for without
Confirmation and Eucharist, Baptism is certainly valid and efficacious,
but Christian initiation remains incomplete.
1307 For centuries, Latin custom has indicated "the age of discretion"
as the reference point for receiving Confirmation. But in danger of
death children should be confirmed even if they have not yet attained
the age of discretion.123
1308 Although Confirmation is sometimes called the "sacrament of
Christian maturity," we must not confuse adult faith with the adult age
of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a grace of free,
unmerited election and does not need "ratification" to become
effective. St. Thomas reminds us of this:
Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in childhood man
can attain spiritual maturity: as the book of Wisdom says: "For old age
is not honored for length of time, or measured by number of years.
"Many children, through the strength of the Holy Spirit they have
received, have bravely fought for Christ even to the shedding of their
blood.124
1309 Preparation for Confirmation should aim at leading the Christian
toward a more intimate union with Christ and a more lively familiarity
with the Holy Spirit - his actions, his gifts, and his biddings - in order
to be more capable of assuming the apostolic responsibilities of
Christian life. To this end catechesis for Confirmation should strive to
awaken a sense of belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ, the
universal Church as well as the parish community. the latter bears
special responsibility for the preparation of confirmands.125
1310 To receive Confirmation one must be in a state of grace. One
should receive the sacrament of Penance in order to be cleansed for the
gift of the Holy Spirit. More intense prayer should prepare one to
receive the strength and graces of the Holy Spirit with docility and
readiness to act.126
1311 Candidates for Confirmation, as for Baptism, fittingly seek the
spiritual help of a sponsor. To emphasize the unity of the two
sacraments, it is appropriate that this be one of the baptismal
godparents.127

V. The Minister of Confirmation
1312 The original minister of Confirmation is the bishop.128 In the
East, ordinarily the priest who baptizes also immediately confers
Confirmation in one and the same celebration. But he does so with
sacred chrism consecrated by the patriarch or the bishop, thus
expressing the apostolic unity of the Church whose bonds are
strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation. In the Latin Church,
the same discipline applies to the Baptism of adults or to the reception
into full communion with the Church of a person baptized in another
Christian community that does not have valid Confirmation.129
1313 In the Latin Rite, the ordinary minister of Confirmation is the
bishop.130 If the need arises, the bishop may grant the faculty of
administering Confirmation to priests,131 although it is fitting that he
confers it himself, mindful that the celebration of Confirmation has
been temporally separated from Baptism for this reason. Bishops are
the successors of the apostles. They have received the fullness of the
sacrament of Holy Orders. the administration of this sacrament by
them demonstrates clearly that its effect is to unite those who receive it
more closely to the Church, to her apostolic origins, and to her mission
of bearing witness to Christ.
1314 If a Christian is in danger of death, any priest can give him
Confirmation.132 Indeed the Church desires that none of her
children, even the youngest, should depart this world without having
been perfected by the Holy Spirit with the gift of Christ's fullness.

IN BRIEF
1315 "Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came
down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for
it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and
they received the Holy Spirit" (Acts 8:14-17).
1316 Confirmation perfects Baptismal grace; it is the sacrament which
gives the Holy Spirit in order to root us more deeply in the divine
filiation, incorporate us more firmly into Christ, strengthen our bond
with the Church, associate us more closely with her mission, and help
us bear witness to the Christian faith in words accompanied by deeds.
1317 Confirmation, like Baptism, imprints a spiritual mark or indelible
character on the Christian's soul; for this reason one can receive this
sacrament only once in one's life.
1318 In the East this sacrament is administered immediately after
Baptism and is followed by participation in the Eucharist; this tradition
highlights the unity of the three sacraments of Christian initiation. In
the Latin Church this sacrament is administered when the age of
reason has been reached, and its celebration is ordinarily reserved to
the bishop, thus signifying that this sacrament strengthens the ecclesial
bond.
1319 A candidate for Confirmation who has attained the age of reason
must profess the faith, be in the state of grace, have the intention of
receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to assume the role of disciple
and witness to Christ, both within the ecclesial community and in
temporal affairs.
1320 The essential rite of Confirmation is anointing the forehead of
the baptized with sacred chrism (in the East other sense-organs as
well), together with the laying on of the minister's hand and the words:
"Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti" (Be sealed with the Gift of
the Holy Spirit.) in the Roman Rite, or Signaculum doni Spiritus
Sancti (The seal of the gift that is the Holy Spirit) in the Byzantine
rite.
1321 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, its
connection with Baptism is expressed, among other ways, by the
renewal of baptismal promises. the celebration of Confirmation during
the Eucharist helps underline the unity of the sacraments of Christian
initiation.

Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
1322 The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation. Those who
have been raised to the dignity of the royal priesthood by Baptism and
configured more deeply to Christ by Confirmation participate with the
whole community in the Lord's own sacrifice by means of the
Eucharist.
1323 "At the Last Supper, on the night he was betrayed, our Savior
instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood. This he did
in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages
until he should come again, and so to entrust to his beloved Spouse,
the Church, a memorial of his death and resurrection: a sacrament of
love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a Paschal banquet 'in which
Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of
future glory is given to us.'"133

I. The Eucharist - Source and Summit of Ecclesial Life
1324 The Eucharist is "the source and summit of the Christian
life."134 "The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries
and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are
oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole
spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch."135
1325 "The Eucharist is the efficacious sign and sublime cause of that
communion in the divine life and that unity of the People of God by
which the Church is kept in being. It is the culmination both of God's
action sanctifying the world in Christ and of the worship men offer to
Christ and through him to the Father in the Holy Spirit."136
1326 Finally, by the Eucharistic celebration we already unite ourselves
with the heavenly liturgy and anticipate eternal life, when God will be
all in all.137
1327 In brief, the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith: "Our
way of thinking is attuned to the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn
confirms our way of thinking."138

II. What is This Sacrament Called?
1328 The inexhaustible richness of this sacrament is expressed in the
different names we give it. Each name evokes certain aspects of it. It is
called: Eucharist, because it is an action of thanksgiving to God. the
Greek words eucharistein139 and eulogein140 recall the Jewish
blessings that proclaim - especially during a meal - God's works:
creation, redemption, and sanctification.
1329 The Lord's Supper, because of its connection with the supper
which the Lord took with his disciples on the eve of his Passion and
because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb in the heavenly
Jerusalem.141
The Breaking of Bread, because Jesus used this rite, part of a Jewish
meat when as master of the table he blessed and distributed the
bread,142 above all at the Last Supper.143 It is by this action that his
disciples will recognize him after his Resurrection,144 and it is this
expression that the first Christians will use to designate their
Eucharistic assemblies;145 by doing so they signified that all who eat
the one broken bread, Christ, enter into communion with him and
form but one body in him.146
The Eucharistic assembly (synaxis), because the Eucharist is
celebrated amid the assembly of the faithful, the visible expression of
the Church.147
1330 The memorial of the Lord's Passion and Resurrection.
The Holy Sacrifice, because it makes present the one sacrifice of
Christ the Savior and includes the Church's offering. the terms holy
sacrifice of the Mass, "sacrifice of praise," spiritual sacrifice, pure and
holy sacrifice are also used,148 since it completes and surpasses all the
sacrifices of the Old Covenant.
The Holy and Divine Liturgy, because the Church's whole liturgy finds
its center and most intense expression in the celebration of this
sacrament; in the same sense we also call its celebration the Sacred
Mysteries. We speak of the Most Blessed Sacrament because it is the
Sacrament of sacraments. the Eucharistic species reserved in the
tabernacle are designated by this same name.
1331 Holy Communion, because by this sacrament we unite ourselves
to Christ, who makes us sharers in his Body and Blood to form a single
body.149 We also call it: the holy things (ta hagia; sancta)150 - the first
meaning of the phrase "communion of saints" in the Apostles' Creed -
the bread of angels, bread from heaven, medicine of immortality,151
viaticum....
1332 Holy Mass (Missa), because the liturgy in which the mystery of
salvation is accomplished concludes with the sending forth (missio) of
the faithful, so that they may fulfill God's will in their daily lives.

III. The Eucharist in the Economy of Salvation
The signs of bread and wine
1333 At the heart of the Eucharistic celebration are the bread and wine
that, by the words of Christ and the invocation of the Holy Spirit,
become Christ's Body and Blood. Faithful to the Lord's command the
Church continues to do, in his memory and until his glorious return,
what he did on the eve of his Passion: "He took bread...." "He took the
cup filled with wine...." the signs of bread and wine become, in a way
surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ; they
continue also to signify the goodness of creation. Thus in the Offertory
we give thanks to the Creator for bread and wine,152 fruit of the "work
of human hands," but above all as "fruit of the earth" and "of the vine"
- gifts of the Creator. the Church sees in the gesture of the king-priest
Melchizedek, who "brought out bread and wine," a prefiguring of her
own offering.153
1334 In the Old Covenant bread and wine were offered in sacrifice
among the first fruits of the earth as a sign of grateful acknowledgment
to the Creator. But they also received a new significance in the context
of the Exodus: the unleavened bread that Israel eats every year at
Passover commemorates the haste of the departure that liberated them
from Egypt; the remembrance of the manna in the desert will always
recall to Israel that it lives by the bread of the Word of God;154 their
daily bread is the fruit of the promised land, the pledge of God's
faithfulness to his promises.
The "cup of blessing"155 at the end of the Jewish Passover meal adds
to the festive joy of wine an eschatological dimension: the messianic
expectation of the rebuilding of Jerusalem. When Jesus instituted the
Eucharist, he gave a new and definitive meaning to the blessing of the
bread and the cup.
1335 The miracles of the multiplication of the loaves, when the Lord
says the blessing, breaks and distributes the loaves through his disciples
to feed the multitude, prefigure the superabundance of this unique
bread of his Eucharist.156 The sign of water turned into wine at Cana
already announces the Hour of Jesus' glorification. It makes manifest
the fulfillment of the wedding feast in the Father's kingdom, where the
faithful will drink the new wine that has become the Blood of
Christ.157
1336 The first announcement of the Eucharist divided the disciples,
just as the announcement of the Passion scandalized them: "This is a
hard saying; who can listen to it?"158 The Eucharist and the Cross are
stumbling blocks. It is the same mystery and it never ceases to be an
occasion of division. "Will you also go away?":159 The Lord's question
echoes through the ages, as a loving invitation to discover that only he
has "the words of eternal life"160 and that to receive in faith the gift of
his Eucharist is to receive the Lord himself.
The institution of the Eucharist
1337 The Lord, having loved those who were his own, loved them to
the end. Knowing that the hour had come to leave this world and
return to the Father, in the course of a meal he washed their feet and
gave them the commandment of love.161 In order to leave them a
pledge of this love, in order never to depart from his own and to make
them sharers in his Passover, he instituted the Eucharist as the
memorial of his death and Resurrection, and commanded his apostles
to celebrate it until his return; "thereby he constituted them priests of
the New Testament."162
1338 The three synoptic Gospels and St. Paul have handed on to us
the account of the institution of the Eucharist; St. John, for his part,
reports the words of Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum that prepare
for the institution of the Eucharist: Christ calls himself the bread of
life, come down from heaven.163
1339 Jesus chose the time of Passover to fulfill what he had announced
at Capernaum: giving his disciples his Body and his Blood:
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb
had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and
prepare the passover meal for us, that we may eat it...." They went ...
and prepared the passover. and when the hour came, he sat at table,
and the apostles with him. and he said to them, "I have earnestly
desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall
not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.".... and he
took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to
them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in
remembrance of me." and likewise the cup after supper, saying, "This
cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my
blood."164
1340 By celebrating the Last Supper with his apostles in the course of
the Passover meal, Jesus gave the Jewish Passover its definitive
meaning. Jesus' passing over to his father by his death and
Resurrection, the new Passover, is anticipated in the Supper and
celebrated in the Eucharist, which fulfills the Jewish Passover and
anticipates the final Passover of the Church in the glory of the
kingdom.
"Do this in memory of me"
1341 The command of Jesus to repeat his actions and words "until he
comes" does not only ask us to remember Jesus and what he did. It is
directed at the liturgical celebration, by the apostles and their
successors, of the memorial of Christ, of his life, of his death, of his
Resurrection, and of his intercession in the presence of the Father.165
1342 From the beginning the Church has been faithful to the Lord's
command. of the Church of Jerusalem it is written:
They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to
the breaking of bread and the prayers.... Day by day, attending the
temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of
food with glad and generous hearts.166
1343 It was above all on "the first day of the week," Sunday, the day of
Jesus' resurrection, that the Christians met "to break bread."167 From
that time on down to our own day the celebration of the Eucharist has
been continued so that today we encounter it everywhere in the
Church with the same fundamental structure. It remains the center of
the Church's life.
1344 Thus from celebration to celebration, as they proclaim the
Paschal mystery of Jesus "until he comes," the pilgrim People of God
advances, "following the narrow way of the cross,"168 toward the
heavenly banquet, when all the elect will be seated at the table of the
kingdom.

IV. The Liturgical Celebration of the Eucharist
The Mass of all ages
1345 As early as the second century we have the witness of St. Justin
Martyr for the basic lines of the order of the Eucharistic celebration.
They have stayed the same until our own day for all the great liturgical
families. St. Justin wrote to the pagan emperor Antoninus Pius (138-
161) around the year 155, explaining what Christians did:
On the day we call the day of the sun, all who dwell in the city or
country gather in the same place.
The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read,
as much as time permits.
When the reader has finished, he who presides over those gathered
admonishes and challenges them to imitate these beautiful things.
Then we all rise together and offer prayers* for ourselves . . .and for all
others, wherever they may be, so that we may be found righteous by
our life and actions, and faithful to the commandments, so as to obtain
eternal salvation.
When the prayers are concluded we exchange the kiss.
Then someone brings bread and a cup of water and wine mixed
together to him who presides over the brethren.
He takes them and offers praise and glory to the Father of the universe,
through the name of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit and for a considerable time he gives thanks (in Greek:
eucharistian) that we have been judged worthy of these gifts.
When he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all present give
voice to an acclamation by saying: 'Amen.'
When he who presides has given thanks and the people have
responded, those whom we call deacons give to those present the
"eucharisted" bread, wine and water and take them to those who are
absent.169
1346 The liturgy of the Eucharist unfolds according to a fundamental
structure which has been preserved throughout the centuries down to
our own day. It displays two great parts that form a fundamental unity:
- the gathering, the liturgy of the Word, with readings, homily and
general intercessions;
- the liturgy of the Eucharist, with the presentation of the bread and
wine, the consecratory thanksgiving, and communion.
The liturgy of the Word and liturgy of the Eucharist together form "one
single act of worship";170 The Eucharistic table set for us is the table
both of the Word of God and of the Body of the Lord.171
1347 Is this not the same movement as the Paschal meal of the risen
Jesus with his disciples? Walking with them he explained the Scriptures
to them; sitting with them at table "he took bread, blessed and broke it,
and gave it to them."172
The movement of the celebration
1348 All gather together. Christians come together in one place for the
Eucharistic assembly. At its head is Christ himself, the principal agent
of the Eucharist. He is high priest of the New Covenant; it is he
himself who presides invisibly over every Eucharistic celebration. It is
in representing him that the bishop or priest acting in the person of
Christ the head (in persona Christi capitis) presides over the assembly,
speaks after the readings, receives the offerings, and says the
Eucharistic Prayer. All have their own active parts to play in the
celebration, each in his own way: readers, those who bring up the
offerings, those who give communion, and the whole people whose
"Amen" manifests their participation.
1349 The Liturgy of the Word includes "the writings of the prophets,"
that is, the Old Testament, and "the memoirs of the apostles" (their
letters and the Gospels). After the homily, which is an exhortation to
accept this Word as what it truly is, the Word of God,173 and to put it
into practice, come the intercessions for all men, according to the
Apostle's words: "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings, and all who are in high
positions."174
1350 The presentation of the offerings (the Offertory). Then,
sometimes in procession, the bread and wine are brought to the altar;
they will be offered by the priest in the name of Christ in the
Eucharistic sacrifice in which they will become his body and blood. It
is the very action of Christ at the Last Supper - "taking the bread and a
cup." "The Church alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator, when
she offers what comes forth from his creation with thanksgiving."175
The presentation of the offerings at the altar takes up the gesture of
Melchizedek and commits the Creator's gifts into the hands of Christ
who, in his sacrifice, brings to perfection all human attempts to offer
sacrifices.
1351 From the very beginning Christians have brought, along with the
bread and wine for the Eucharist, gifts to share with those in need.
This custom of the collection, ever appropriate, is inspired by the
example of Christ who became poor to make us rich:176
Those who are well off, and who are also willing, give as each chooses.
What is gathered is given to him who presides to assist orphans and
widows, those whom illness or any other cause has deprived of
resources, prisoners, immigrants and, in a word, all who are in
need.177
1352 he anaphora: with the Eucharistic Prayer - the prayer of
thanksgiving and consecration - we come to the heart and summit of
the celebration:
In the preface, the Church gives thanks to the Father, through Christ,
in the Holy Spirit, for all his works: creation, redemption, and
sanctification. the whole community thus joins in the unending praise
that the Church in heaven, the angels and all the saints, sing to the
thrice-holy God.
1353 In the epiclesis, the Church asks the Father to send his Holy
Spirit (or the power of his blessing178) on the bread and wine, so that
by his power they may become the body and blood of Jesus Christ and
so that those who take part in the Eucharist may be one body and one
spirit (some liturgical traditions put the epiclesis after the anamnesis).
In the institution narrative, the power of the words and the action of
Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit, make sacramentally present
under the species of bread and wine Christ's body and blood, his
sacrifice offered on the cross once for all.
1354 In the anamnesis that follows, the Church calls to mind the
Passion, resurrection, and glorious return of Christ Jesus; she presents
to the Father the offering of his Son which reconciles us with him.
In the intercessions, the Church indicates that the Eucharist is
celebrated in communion with the whole Church in heaven and on
earth, the living and the dead, and in communion with the pastors of
the Church, the Pope, the diocesan bishop, his presbyterium and his
deacons, and all the bishops of the whole world together with their
Churches.
1355 In the communion, preceded by the Lord's prayer and the
breaking of the bread, the faithful receive "the bread of heaven" and
"the cup of salvation," the body and blood of Christ who offered
himself "for the life of the world":179
Because this bread and wine have been made Eucharist ("eucharisted,"
according to an ancient expression), "we call this food Eucharist, and
no one may take part in it unless he believes that what we teach is true,
has received baptism for the forgiveness of sins and new birth, and lives
in keeping with what Christ taught."180

MYSTERY

INITIATION




Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST




V. The Sacramental Sacrifice Thanksgiving, Memorial, Presence
1356 If from the beginning Christians have celebrated the Eucharist
and in a form whose substance has not changed despite the great
diversity of times and liturgies, it is because we know ourselves to be
bound by the command the Lord gave on the eve of his Passion: "Do
this in remembrance of me."181
1357 We carry out this command of the Lord by celebrating the
memorial of his sacrifice. In so doing, we offer to the Father what he
has himself given us: the gifts of his creation, bread and wine which, by
the power of the Holy Spirit and by the words of Christ, have become
the body and blood of Christ. Christ is thus really and mysteriously
made present.
1358 We must therefore consider the Eucharist as: - thanksgiving and
praise to the Father;
- the sacrificial memorial of Christ and his Body;
- the presence of Christ by the power of his word and of his Spirit.
Thanksgiving and praise to the Father
1359 The Eucharist, the sacrament of our salvation accomplished by
Christ on the cross, is also a sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for the
work of creation. In the Eucharistic sacrifice the whole of creation
loved by God is presented to the Father through the death and the
Resurrection of Christ. Through Christ the Church can offer the
sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for all that God has made good,
beautiful, and just in creation and in humanity.
1360 The Eucharist is a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Father, a
blessing by which the Church expresses her gratitude to God for all his
benefits, for all that he has accomplished through creation,
redemption, and sanctification. Eucharist means first of all
"thanksgiving."
1361 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of praise by which the Church
sings the glory of God in the name of all creation. This sacrifice of
praise is possible only through Christ: he unites the faithful to his
person, to his praise, and to his intercession, so that the sacrifice of
praise to the Father is offered through Christ and with him, to be
accepted in him.
The sacrificial memorial of Christ and of his Body, the Church
1362 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the making
present and the sacramental offering of his unique sacrifice, in the
liturgy of the Church which is his Body. In all the Eucharistic Prayers
we find after the words of institution a prayer called the anamnesis or
memorial.
1363 In the sense of Sacred Scripture the memorial is not merely the
recollection of past events but the proclamation of the mighty works
wrought by God for men.182 In the liturgical celebration of these
events, they become in a certain way present and real. This is how
Israel understands its liberation from Egypt: every time Passover is
celebrated, the Exodus events are made present to the memory of
believers so that they may conform their lives to them.
1364 In the New Testament, the memorial takes on new meaning.
When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates
Christ's Passover, and it is made present the sacrifice Christ offered
once for all on the cross remains ever present.183 "As often as the
sacrifice of the Cross by which 'Christ our Pasch has been sacrificed' is
celebrated on the altar, the work of our redemption is carried out."184
1365 Because it is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the Eucharist is
also a sacrifice. the sacrificial character of the Eucharist is manifested
in the very words of institution: "This is my body which is given for
you" and "This cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant
in my blood."185 In the Eucharist Christ gives us the very body which
he gave up for us on the cross, the very blood which he "poured out for
many for the forgiveness of sins."186
1366 The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes
present) the sacrifice of the cross, because it is its memorial and
because it applies its fruit:
[Christ], our Lord and God, was once and for all to offer himself to
God the Father by his death on the altar of the cross, to accomplish
there an everlasting redemption. But because his priesthood was not to
end with his death, at the Last Supper "on the night when he was
betrayed," [he wanted] to leave to his beloved spouse the Church a
visible sacrifice (as the nature of man demands) by which the bloody
sacrifice which he was to accomplish once for all on the cross would be
re-presented, its memory perpetuated until the end of the world, and
its salutary power be applied to the forgiveness of the sins we daily
commit.187
1367 The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one
single sacrifice: "The victim is one and the same: the same now offers
through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross;
only the manner of offering is different." "And since in this divine
sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered
himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained
and is offered in an unbloody manner... this sacrifice is truly
propitiatory."188
1368 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church. the Church
which is the Body of Christ participates in the offering of her Head.
With him, she herself is offered whole and entire. She unites herself to
his intercession with the Father for all men. In the Eucharist the
sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of his
Body. the lives of the faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer, and work,
are united with those of Christ and with his total offering, and so
acquire a new value. Christ's sacrifice present on the altar makes it
possible for all generations of Christians to be united with his offering.
In the catacombs the Church is often represented as a woman in
prayer, arms outstretched in the praying position. Like Christ who
stretched out his arms on the cross, through him, with him, and in
him, she offers herself and intercedes for all men.
1369 The whole Church is united with the offering and intercession of
Christ. Since he has the ministry of Peter in the Church, the Pope is
associated with every celebration of the Eucharist, wherein he is named
as the sign and servant of the unity of the universal Church. the bishop
of the place is always responsible for the Eucharist, even when a priest
presides; the bishop's name is mentioned to signify his presidency over
the particular Church, in the midst of his presbyterium and with the
assistance of deacons. the community intercedes also for all ministers
who, for it and with it, offer the Eucharistic sacrifice:
Let only that Eucharist be regarded as legitimate, which is celebrated
under [the presidency of] the bishop or him to whom he has entrusted
it.189
Through the ministry of priests the spiritual sacrifice of the faithful is
completed in union with the sacrifice of Christ the only Mediator,
which in the Eucharist is offered through the priests' hands in the
name of the whole Church in an unbloody and sacramental manner
until the Lord himself comes.190
1370 To the offering of Christ are united not only the members still
here on earth, but also those already in the glory of heaven. In
communion with and commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary and all
the saints, the Church offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. In the Eucharist
the Church is as it were at the foot of the cross with Mary, united with
the offering and intercession of Christ.
1371 The Eucharistic sacrifice is also offered for the faithful departed
who "have died in Christ but are not yet wholly purified,"191 so that
they may be able to enter into the light and peace of Christ:
Put this body anywhere! Don't trouble yourselves about it! I simply ask
you to remember me at the Lord's altar wherever you are.192
Then, we pray [in the anaphora] for the holy fathers and bishops who
have fallen asleep, and in general for all who have fallen asleep before
us, in the belief that it is a great benefit to the souls on whose behalf
the supplication is offered, while the holy and tremendous Victim is
present.... By offering to God our supplications for those who have
fallen asleep, if they have sinned, we . . . offer Christ sacrificed for the
sins of all, and so render favorable, for them and for us, the God who
loves man.193
1372 St. Augustine admirably summed up this doctrine that moves us
to an ever more complete participation in our Redeemer's sacrifice
which we celebrate in the Eucharist:
This wholly redeemed city, the assembly and society of the saints, is
offered to God as a universal sacrifice by the high priest who in the
form of a slave went so far as to offer himself for us in his Passion, to
make us the Body of so great a head.... Such is the sacrifice of
Christians: "we who are many are one Body in Christ" the Church
continues to reproduce this sacrifice in the sacrament of the altar so
well-known to believers wherein it is evident to them that in what she
offers she herself is offered.194
The presence of Christ by the power of his word and the Holy Spirit
1373 "Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who
is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us," is present in
many ways to his Church:195 in his word, in his Church's prayer,
"where two or three are gathered in my name,"196 in the poor, the
sick, and the imprisoned,197 in the sacraments of which he is the
author, in the sacrifice of the Mass, and in the person of the minister.
But "he is present . . . most especially in the Eucharistic species."198
1374 The mode of Christ's presence under the Eucharistic species is
unique. It raises the Eucharist above all the sacraments as "the
perfection of the spiritual life and the end to which all the sacraments
tend."199 In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist "the body
and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ
and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, and substantially
contained."200 "This presence is called 'real' - by which is not
intended to exclude the other types of presence as if they could not be
'real' too, but because it is presence in the fullest sense: that is to say, it
is a substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes himself
wholly and entirely present."201
1375 It is by the conversion of the bread and wine into Christ's body
and blood that Christ becomes present in this sacrament. the Church
Fathers strongly affirmed the faith of the Church in the efficacy of the
Word of Christ and of the action of the Holy Spirit to bring about this
conversion. Thus St. John Chrysostom declares:
It is not man that causes the things offered to become the Body and
Blood of Christ, but he who was crucified for us, Christ himself. the
priest, in the role of Christ, pronounces these words, but their power
and grace are God's. This is my body, he says. This word transforms
the things offered.202
and St. Ambrose says about this conversion:
Be convinced that this is not what nature has formed, but what the
blessing has consecrated. the power of the blessing prevails over that of
nature, because by the blessing nature itself is changed.... Could not
Christ's word, which can make from nothing what did not exist, change
existing things into what they were not before? It is no less a feat to
give things their original nature than to change their nature.203
1376 The Council of Trent summarizes the Catholic faith by declaring:
"Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he
was offering under the species of bread, it has always been the
conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares
again, that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place
a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the
body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into
the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has
fittingly and properly called transubstantiation."204
1377 The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the
consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist.
Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and
entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the
bread does not divide Christ.205
1378 Worship of the Eucharist. In the liturgy of the Mass we express
our faith in the real presence of Christ under the species of bread and
wine by, among other ways, genuflecting or bowing deeply as a sign of
adoration of the Lord. "The Catholic Church has always offered and
still offers to the sacrament of the Eucharist the cult of adoration, not
only during Mass, but also outside of it, reserving the consecrated
hosts with the utmost care, exposing them to the solemn veneration of
the faithful, and carrying them in procession."206
1379 The tabernacle was first intended for the reservation of the
Eucharist in a worthy place so that it could be brought to the sick and
those absent outside of Mass. As faith in the real presence of Christ in
his Eucharist deepened, the Church became conscious of the meaning
of silent adoration of the Lord present under the Eucharistic species. It
is for this reason that the tabernacle should be located in an especially
worthy place in the church and should be constructed in such a way
that it emphasizes and manifests the truth of the real presence of
Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.
1380 It is highly fitting that Christ should have wanted to remain
present to his Church in this unique way. Since Christ was about to
take his departure from his own in his visible form, he wanted to give
us his sacramental presence; since he was about to offer himself on the
cross to save us, he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with
which he loved us "to the end,"207 even to the giving of his life. In his
Eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one
who loved us and gave himself up for us,208 and he remains under
signs that express and communicate this love:
The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic worship.
Jesus awaits us in this sacrament of love. Let us not refuse the time to
go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation full of faith, and open to
making amends for the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let
our adoration never cease.209
1381 "That in this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and his true
Blood is something that 'cannot be apprehended by the senses,' says St.
Thomas, 'but only by faith, which relies on divine authority.' For this
reason, in a commentary on Luke 22:19 ('This is my body which is
given for you.'), St. Cyril says: 'Do not doubt whether this is true, but
rather receive the words of the Savior in faith, for since he is the truth,
he cannot lie.'"210
Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore
Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart
Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.


Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived;
How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
What God's Son has told me, take for truth I do;
Truth himself speaks truly or there's nothing true.211

PART TWO: THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN
MYSTERY

CHAPTER ONE THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN
INITIATION




Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST




VI. The Paschal Banquet
1382 The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial
memorial in which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and the
sacred banquet of communion with the Lord's body and blood. But
the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward
the intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion. To
receive communion is to receive Christ himself who has offered himself
for us.
1383 The altar, around which the Church is gathered in the
celebration of the Eucharist, represents the two aspects of the same
mystery: the altar of the sacrifice and the table of the Lord. This is all
the more so since the Christian altar is the symbol of Christ himself,
present in the midst of the assembly of his faithful, both as the victim
offered for our reconciliation and as food from heaven who is giving
himself to us. "For what is the altar of Christ if not the image of the
Body of Christ?"212 asks St. Ambrose. He says elsewhere, "The altar
represents the body [of Christ] and the Body of Christ is on the
altar."213 The liturgy expresses this unity of sacrifice and communion
in many prayers. Thus the Roman Church prays in its anaphora:
We entreat you, almighty God,
that by the hands of your holy Angel
this offering may be borne to your altar in heaven
in the sight of your divine majesty,
so that as we receive in communion at this altar
the most holy Body and Blood of your Son,
we may be filled with every heavenly blessing and grace.214
"Take this and eat it, all of you": communion
1384 The Lord addresses an invitation to us, urging us to receive him
in the sacrament of the Eucharist: "Truly, I say to you, unless you eat
the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in
you."215
1385 To respond to this invitation we must prepare ourselves for so
great and so holy a moment. St. Paul urges us to examine our
conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of
the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body
and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the
bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without
discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself."216
Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of
Reconciliation before coming to communion.
1386 Before so great a sacrament, the faithful can only echo humbly
and with ardent faith the words of the Centurion: "Domine, non sum
dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo, et sanabitur
anima mea" ("Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my
roof, but only say the word and my soul will be healed.").217 and in
the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom the faithful pray in the
same spirit:
O Son of God, bring me into communion today with your mystical
supper. I shall not tell your enemies the secret, nor kiss you with Judas'
kiss. But like the good thief I cry, "Jesus, remember me when you come
into your kingdom."
1387 To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful
should observe the fast required in their Church.218 Bodily demeanor
(gestures, clothing) ought to convey the respect, solemnity, and joy of
this moment when Christ becomes our guest.
1388 It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that the
faithful, if they have the required dispositions,.218B receive
communion when they participate in the Mass.219 As the Second
Vatican Council says: "That more perfect form of participation in the
Mass whereby the faithful, after the priest's communion, receive the
Lord's Body from the same sacrifice, is warmly recommended."220
1389 The Church obliges the faithful to take part in the Divine Liturgy
on Sundays and feast days and, prepared by the sacrament of
Reconciliation, to receive the Eucharist at least once a year, if possible
during the Easter season.221 But the Church strongly encourages the
faithful to receive the holy Eucharist on Sundays and feast days, or
more often still, even daily.
1390 Since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species,
communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to
receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons this
manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as
the most common form in the Latin rite. But "the sign of communion
is more complete when given under both kinds, since in that form the
sign of the Eucharistic meal appears more clearly."222 This is the usual
form of receiving communion in the Eastern rites.
The fruits of Holy Communion
1391 Holy Communion augments our union with Christ. the principal
fruit of receiving the Eucharist in Holy Communion is an intimate
union with Christ Jesus. Indeed, the Lord said: "He who eats my flesh
and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him."223 Life in Christ has
its foundation in the Eucharistic banquet: "As the living Father sent
me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live
because of me."224
On the feasts of the Lord, when the faithful receive the Body of the
Son, they proclaim to one another the Good News that the first fruits
of life have been given, as when the angel said to Mary Magdalene,
"Christ is risen!" Now too are life and resurrection conferred on
whoever receives Christ.225
1392 What material food produces in our bodily life, Holy
Communion wonderfully achieves in our spiritual life. Communion
with the flesh of the risen Christ, a flesh "given life and giving life
through the Holy Spirit,"226 preserves, increases, and renews the life
of grace received at Baptism. This growth in Christian life needs the
nourishment of Eucharistic Communion, the bread for our pilgrimage
until the moment of death, when it will be given to us as viaticum.
1393 Holy Communion separates us from sin. the body of Christ we
receive in Holy Communion is "given up for us," and the blood we
drink "shed for the many for the forgiveness of sins." For this reason
the Eucharist cannot unite us to Christ without at the same time
cleansing us from past sins and preserving us from future sins:
For as often as we eat this bread and drink the cup, we proclaim the
death of the Lord. If we proclaim the Lord's death, we proclaim the
forgiveness of sins. If, as often as his blood is poured out, it is poured
for the forgiveness of sins, I should always receive it, so that it may
always forgive my sins. Because I always sin, I should always have a
remedy.227
1394 As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist
strengthens our charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life; and
this living charity wipes away venial sins.228 By giving himself to us
Christ revives our love and enables us to break our disordered
attachments to creatures and root ourselves in him:
Since Christ died for us out of love, when we celebrate the memorial of
his death at the moment of sacrifice we ask that love may be granted to
us by the coming of the Holy Spirit. We humbly pray that in the
strength of this love by which Christ willed to die for us, we, by
receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, may be able to consider the world
as crucified for us, and to be ourselves as crucified to the world....
Having received the gift of love, let us die to sin and live for God.229
1395 By the same charity that it enkindles in us, the Eucharist
preserves us from future mortal sins. the more we share the life of
Christ and progress in his friendship, the more difficult it is to break
away from him by mortal sin. the Eucharist is not ordered to the
forgiveness of mortal sins - that is proper to the sacrament of
Reconciliation. the Eucharist is properly the sacrament of those who
are in full communion with the Church.
1396 The unity of the Mystical Body: the Eucharist makes the Church.
Those who receive the Eucharist are united more closely to Christ.
Through it Christ unites them to all the faithful in one body - the
Church. Communion renews, strengthens, and deepens this
incorporation into the Church, already achieved by Baptism. In
Baptism we have been called to form but one body.230 The Eucharist
fulfills this call: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a
participation in the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not
a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we
who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread:"231
If you are the body and members of Christ, then it is your sacrament
that is placed on the table of the Lord; it is your sacrament that you
receive. To that which you are you respond "Amen" ("yes, it is true!")
and by responding to it you assent to it. For you hear the words, "the
Body of Christ" and respond "Amen." Be then a member of the Body
of Christ that your Amen may be true.232
1397 The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the
Body and Blood of Christ given up for us, we must recognize Christ in
the poorest, his brethren:
You have tasted the Blood of the Lord, yet you do not recognize your
brother,.... You dishonor this table when you do not judge worthy of
sharing your food someone judged worthy to take part in this meal....
God freed you from all your sins and invited you here, but you have
not become more merciful.233
1398 The Eucharist and the unity of Christians. Before the greatness of
this mystery St. Augustine exclaims, "O sacrament of devotion! O sign
of unity! O bond of charity!"234 The more painful the experience of
the divisions in the Church which break the common participation in
the table of the Lord, the more urgent are our prayers to the Lord that
the time of complete unity among all who believe in him may return.
1399 The Eastern churches that are not in full communion with the
Catholic Church celebrate the Eucharist with great love. "These
Churches, although separated from us, yet possess true sacraments,
above all - by apostolic succession - the priesthood and the Eucharist,
whereby they are still joined to us in closest intimacy." A certain
communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, "given suitable
circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely
possible but is encouraged."235
1400 Ecclesial communities derived from the Reformation and
separated from the Catholic Church, "have not preserved the proper
reality of the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness, especially because of
the absence of the sacrament of Holy Orders."236 It is for this reason
that, for the Catholic Church, Eucharistic intercommunion with these
communities is not possible. However these ecclesial communities,
"when they commemorate the Lord's death and resurrection in the
Holy Supper . . . profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ
and await his coming in glory."237
1401 When, in the Ordinary's judgment, a grave necessity arises,
Catholic ministers may give the sacraments of Eucharist, Penance, and
Anointing of the Sick to other Christians not in full communion with
the Catholic Church, who ask for them of their own will, provided they
give evidence of holding the Catholic faith regarding these sacraments
and possess the required dispositions.238

Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
VII. The Eucharist - "Pledge of the Glory To Come"
1402 In an ancient prayer the Church acclaims the mystery of the
Eucharist: "O sacred banquet in which Christ is received as food, the
memory of his Passion is renewed, the soul is filled with grace and a
pledge of the life to come is given to us." If the Eucharist is the
memorial of the Passover of the Lord Jesus, if by our communion at
the altar we are filled "with every heavenly blessing and grace,"239
then the Eucharist is also an anticipation of the heavenly glory.
1403 At the Last Supper the Lord himself directed his disciples'
attention toward the fulfillment of the Passover in the kingdom of God:
"I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day
when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."240 Whenever
the Church celebrates the Eucharist she remembers this promise and
turns her gaze "to him who is to come." In her prayer she calls for his
coming: "Marana tha!" "Come, Lord Jesus!"241 "May your grace come
and this world pass away!"242
1404 The Church knows that the Lord comes even now in his
Eucharist and that he is there in our midst. However, his presence is
veiled. Therefore we celebrate the Eucharist "awaiting the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ,"243 asking "to share in
your glory when every tear will be wiped away. On that day we shall see
you, our God, as you are. We shall become like you and praise you for
ever through Christ our Lord."244
1405 There is no surer pledge or dearer sign of this great hope in the
new heavens and new earth "in which righteousness dwells,"245 than
the Eucharist. Every time this mystery is celebrated, "the work of our
redemption is carried on" and we "break the one bread that provides
the medicine of immortality, the antidote for death, and the food that
makes us live for ever in Jesus Christ."246

CHAPTER ONE THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN
INITIATION




Article 3 THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST




IN BRIEF
1406 Jesus said: "I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if
any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; . . . he who eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has eternal life and . . . abides in me, and I in
him" (? Jn 6:51, ? 54, ? 56).
1407 The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the Church's life,
for in it Christ associates his Church and all her members with his
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving offered once for all on the cross to
his Father; by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation on his
Body which is the Church.
1408 The Eucharistic celebration always includes: the proclamation of
the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits,
above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine; and
participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's body and
blood. These elements constitute one single act of worship.
1409 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, that is, of the
work of salvation accomplished by the life, death, and resurrection of
Christ, a work made present by the liturgical action.
1410 It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant
who, acting through the ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic
sacrifice. and it is the same Christ, really present under the species of
bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.
1411 Only validly ordained priests can preside at the Eucharist and
consecrate the bread and the wine so that they become the Body and
Blood of the Lord.
1412 The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread
and grape wine, on which the blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked and
the priest pronounces the words of consecration spoken by Jesus
during the Last Supper: "This is my body which will be given up for
you.... This is the cup of my blood...."
1413 By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine
into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought about. Under the
consecrated species of bread and wine Christ himself, living and
glorious, is present in a true, real, and substantial manner: his Body
and his Blood, with his soul and his divinity (cf. Council of Trent: DS
1640; 1651).
1414 As sacrifice, the Eucharist is also offered in reparation for the sins
of the living and the dead and to obtain spiritual or temporal benefits
from God.
1415 Anyone who desires to receive Christ in Eucharistic communion
must be in the state of grace. Anyone aware of having sinned mortally
must not receive communion without having received absolution in the
sacrament of penance.
1416 Communion with the Body and Blood of Christ increases the
communicant's union with the Lord, forgives his venial sins, and
preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this sacrament
strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and Christ,
it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the Mystical Body of
Christ.
1417 The Church warmly recommends that the faithful receive Holy
Communion when they participate in the celebration of the Eucharist;
she obliges them to do so at least once a year.
1418 Because Christ himself is present in the sacrament of the altar, he
is to be honored with the worship of adoration. "To visit the Blessed
Sacrament is . . . a proof of gratitude, an expression of love, and a duty
of adoration toward Christ our Lord" (Paul VI, MF 66).
1419 Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ gives us in
the Eucharist the pledge of glory with him. Participation in the Holy
Sacrifice identifies us with his Heart, sustains our strength along the
pilgrimage of this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us even
now to the Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the
saints

CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENTS OF HEALING
1420 Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man receives the
new life of Christ. Now we carry this life "in earthen vessels," and it
remains "hidden with Christ in God."1 We are still in our "earthly
tent," subject to suffering, illness, and death.2 This new life as a child
of God can be weakened and even lost by sin.
1421 The Lord Jesus Christ, physician of our souls and bodies, who
forgave the sins of the paralytic and restored him to bodily health,3 has
willed that his Church continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his
work of healing and salvation, even among her own members. This is
the purpose of the two sacraments of healing: the sacrament of
Penance and the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

sacramentally present Jesus' call to conversion, the first step in
returning to the Father5 from whom one has strayed by sin.
It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the Christian
sinner's personal and ecclesial steps of conversion, penance, and
satisfaction.
1424 It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure or
confession of sins to a priest is an essential element of this sacrament.
In a profound sense it is also a "confession" - acknowledgment and
praise - of the holiness of God and of his mercy toward sinful man.
It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, since by the priest's
sacramental absolution God grants the penitent "pardon and peace."6
It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the
sinner the live of God who reconciles: "Be reconciled to God."7 He
who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call:
"Go; first be reconciled to your brother."8

II. Why a Sacrament of Reconciliation after Baptism?
1425 "YOU were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."9 One
must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given us in the
sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree to which
sin is excluded for him who has "put on Christ."10 But the apostle
John also says: "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us."11 and the Lord himself taught us to pray: "Forgive
us our trespasses,"12 linking our forgiveness of one another's offenses
to the forgiveness of our sins that God will grant us.
1426 Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of the
Holy Spirit and the Body and Blood of Christ received as food have
made us "holy and without blemish," just as the Church herself, the
Bride of Christ, is "holy and without blemish."13 Nevertheless the new
life received in Christian initiation has not abolished the frailty and
weakness of human nature, nor the inclination to sin that tradition calls
concupiscence, which remains in the baptized such that with the help
of the grace of Christ they may prove themselves in the struggle of
Christian life.14 This is the struggle of conversion directed toward
holiness and eternal life to which the Lord never ceases to call us.15

III. The Conversion of the Baptized
1427 Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the
proclamation of the kingdom: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel."16 In the Church's
preaching this call is addressed first to those who do not yet know
Christ and his Gospel. Also, Baptism is the principal place for the first
and fundamental conversion. It is by faith in the Gospel and by
Baptism17 that one renounces evil and gains salvation, that is, the
forgiveness of all sins and the gift of new life.
1428 Christ's call to conversion continues to resound in the lives of
Christians. This second conversion is an uninterrupted task for the
whole Church who, "clasping sinners to her bosom, (is) at once holy
and always in need of purification, (and) follows constantly the path of
penance and renewal."18 This endeavor of conversion is not just a
human work. It is the movement of a "contrite heart," drawn and
moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us
first.19
1429 St. Peter's conversion after he had denied his master three times
bears witness to this. Jesus' look of infinite mercy drew tears of
repentance from Peter and, after the Lord's resurrection, a threefold
affirmation of love for him.20 The second conversion also has a
communitarian dimension, as is clear in the Lord's call to a whole
Church: "Repent!"21
St. Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church, "there are
water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance."22

IV. Interior Penance
1430 Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets
before him, does not aim first at outward works, "sackcloth and ashes,"
fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior
conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false;
however, interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures
and works of penance.23
1431 Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a
return, a conversion to God with all our heart, an end of sin, a turning
away from evil, with repugnance toward the evil actions we have
committed. At the same time it entails the desire and resolution to
change one's life, with hope in God's mercy and trust in the help of his
grace. This conversion of heart is accompanied by a salutary pain and
sadness which the Fathers called animi cruciatus (affliction of spirit)
and compunctio cordis (repentance of heart).24
1432 The human heart is heavy and hardened. God must give man a
new heart.25 Conversion is first of all a work of the grace of God who
makes our hearts return to him: "Restore us to thyself, O LORD, that
we may be restored!"26 God gives us the strength to begin anew. It is
in discovering the greatness of God's love that our heart is shaken by
the horror and weight of sin and begins to fear offending God by sin
and being separated from him. the human heart is converted by
looking upon him whom our sins have pierced:27
Let us fix our eyes on Christ's blood and understand how precious it is
to his Father, for, poured out for our salvation it has brought to the
whole world the grace of repentance.
1433 Since Easter, the Holy Spirit has proved "the world wrong about
sin,"29 i.e., proved that the world has not believed in him whom the
Father has sent. But this same Spirit who brings sin to light is also the
Consoler who gives the human heart grace for repentance and
conversion.30

V. The Many Forms of Penance in Christian Life
1434 The interior penance of the Christian can be expressed in many
and various ways. Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three
forms, fasting, prayer, and almsgiving,31 which express conversion in
relation to oneself, to God, and to others. Alongside the radical
purification brought about by Baptism or martyrdom they cite as
means of obtaining forgiveness of sins: effort at reconciliation with
one's neighbor, tears of repentance, concern for the salvation of one's
neighbor, the intercession of the saints, and the practice of charity
"which covers a multitude of sins."32
1435 Conversion is accomplished in daily life by gestures of
reconciliation, concern for the poor, the exercise and defense of justice
and right,33 by the admission of faults to one's brethren, fraternal
correction, revision of life, examination of conscience, spiritual
direction, acceptance of suffering, endurance of persecution for the
sake of righteousness. Taking up one's cross each day and following
Jesus is the surest way of penance.34
1436 Eucharist and Penance. Daily conversion and penance find their
source and nourishment in the Eucharist, for in it is made present the
sacrifice of Christ which has reconciled us with God. Through the
Eucharist those who live from the life of Christ are fed and
strengthened. "It is a remedy to free us from our daily faults and to
preserve us from mortal sins."35
1437 Reading Sacred Scripture, praying the Liturgy of the Hours and
the Our Father - every sincere act of worship or devotion revives the
spirit of conversion and repentance within us and contributes to the
forgiveness of our sins.
1438 The seasons and days of penance in the course of the liturgical
year (Lent, and each Friday in memory of the death of the Lord) are
intense moments of the Church's penitential practice.36 These times
are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies,
pilgrimages as signs of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting
and almsgiving, and fraternal sharing (charitable and missionary
works).
1439 The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus
in the parable of the prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful
father:37 The fascination of illusory freedom, the abandonment of the
father's house; the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after
squandering his fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself
obliged to feed swine, and still worse, at wanting to feed on the husks
the pigs ate; his reflection on all he has lost; his repentance and
decision to declare himself guilty before his father; the journey back;
the father's generous welcome; the father's joy - all these are
characteristic of the process of conversion. the beautiful robe, the ring,
and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life - pure worthy, and
joyful - of anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of his family,
which is the Church. Only the heart of Christ Who knows the depths
of his Father's love could reveal to us the abyss of his mercy in so
simple and beautiful a way.

VI. The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation
1440 Sin is before all else an offense against God, a rupture of
communion with him. At the same time it damages communion with
the Church. For this reason conversion entails both God's forgiveness
and reconciliation with the Church, which are expressed and
accomplished liturgically by the sacrament of Penance and
Reconciliation.38
Only God forgives sin
1441 Only God forgives sins.39 Since he is the Son of God, Jesus says
of himself, "The Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins" and
exercises this divine power: "Your sins are forgiven."40 Further, by
virtue of his divine authority he gives this power to men to exercise in
his name.41
1442 Christ has willed that in her prayer and life and action his whole
Church should be the sign and instrument of the forgiveness and
reconciliation that he acquired for us at the price of his blood. But he
entrusted the exercise of the power of absolution to the apostolic
ministry which he charged with the "ministry of reconciliation."42 The
apostle is sent out "on behalf of Christ" with "God making his appeal"
through him and pleading: "Be reconciled to God."43
Reconciliation with the Church
1443 During his public life Jesus not only forgave sins, but also made
plain the effect of this forgiveness: he reintegrated forgiven sinners into
the community of the People of God from which sin had alienated or
even excluded them. A remarkable sign of this is the fact that Jesus
receives sinners at his table, a gesture that expresses in an astonishing
way both God's forgiveness and the return to the bosom of the People
of God.44
1444 In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the
Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the
Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most
notably in Christ's solemn words to Simon Peter: "I will give you the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."45 "The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter
was also assigned to the college of the apostles united to its head."46
1445 The words bind and loose mean: whomever you exclude from
your communion, will be excluded from communion with God;
whomever you receive anew into your communion, God will welcome
back into his. Reconciliation with the Church is inseparable from
reconciliation with God.
The sacrament of forgiveness
1446 Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful members
of his Church: above all for those who, since Baptism, have fallen into
grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace and wounded
ecclesial communion. It is to them that the sacrament of Penance
offers a new possibility to convert and to recover the grace of
justification. the Fathers of the Church present this sacrament as "the
second plank [of salvation] after the shipwreck which is the loss of
grace."47
1447 Over the centuries the concrete form in which the Church has
exercised this power received from the Lord has varied considerably.
During the first centuries the reconciliation of Christians who had
committed particularly grave sins after their Baptism (for example,
idolatry, murder, or adultery) was tied to a very rigorous discipline,
according to which penitents had to do public penance for their sins,
often for years, before receiving reconciliation. To this "order of
penitents" (which concerned only certain grave sins), one was only
rarely admitted and in certain regions only once in a lifetime. During
the seventh century Irish missionaries, inspired by the Eastern
monastic tradition, took to continental Europe the "private" practice of
penance, which does not require public and prolonged completion of
penitential works before reconciliation with the Church. From that
time on, the sacrament has been performed in secret between penitent
and priest. This new practice envisioned the possibility of repetition
and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of this sacrament. It
allowed the forgiveness of grave sins and venial sins to be integrated
into one sacramental celebration. In its main lines this is the form of
penance that the Church has practiced down to our day.
1448 Beneath the changes in discipline and celebration that this
sacrament has undergone over the centuries, the same fundamental
structure is to be discerned. It comprises two equally essential
elements: on the one hand, the acts of the man who undergoes
conversion through the action of the Holy Spirit: namely, contrition,
confession, and satisfaction; on the other, God's action through the
intervention of the Church. the Church, who through the bishop and
his priests forgives sins in the name of Jesus Christ and determines the
manner of satisfaction, also prays for the sinner and does penance with
him. Thus the sinner is healed and re-established in ecclesial
communion.
1449 The formula of absolution used in the Latin Church expresses
the essential elements of this sacrament: the Father of mercies is the
source of all forgiveness. He effects the reconciliation of sinners
through the Passover of his Son and the gift of his Spirit, through the
prayer and ministry of the Church:
God, the Father of mercies,
through the death and the resurrection of his Son
has reconciled the world to himself
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;
through the ministry of the Church
may God give you pardon and peace,
and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit.48

VII. The Acts of the Penitent
1450 "Penance requires . . . the sinner to endure all things willingly, be
contrite of heart, confess with the lips, and practice complete humility
and fruitful satisfaction."49
Contrition
1451 Among the penitent's acts contrition occupies first place.
Contrition is "sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin committed,
together with the resolution not to sin again."50
1452 When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all else,
contrition is called "perfect" (contrition of charity). Such contrition
remits venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins if it includes
the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon
as possible.51
1453 The contrition called "imperfect" (or "attrition") is also a gift of
God, a prompting of the Holy Spirit. It is born of the consideration of
sin's ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation and the other penalties
threatening the sinner (contrition of fear). Such a stirring of conscience
can initiate an interior process which, under the prompting of grace,
will be brought to completion by sacramental absolution. By itself
however, imperfect contrition cannot obtain the forgiveness of grave
sins, but it disposes one to obtain forgiveness in the sacrament of
Penance.52
1454 The reception of this sacrament ought to be prepared for by an
examination of conscience made in the light of the Word of God. The
passages best suited to this can be found in the Ten Commandments,
moral catechesis of the Gospels and the apostolic Letters, such as the
Sermon on the Mount and the apostolic teachings.53
The confession of sins
1455 The confession (or disclosure) of sins, even from a simply human
point of view, frees us and facilitates our reconciliation with others.
Through such an admission man looks squarely at the sins he is guilty
of, takes responsibility for them, and thereby opens himself again to
God and to the communion of the Church in order to make a new
future possible.
1456 Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament of
Penance: "All mortal sins of which penitents after a diligent self-
examination are conscious must be recounted by them in confession,
even if they are most secret and have been committed against the last
two precepts of the Decalogue; for these sins sometimes wound the
soul more grievously and are more dangerous than those which are
committed openly."54
When Christ's faithful strive to confess all the sins that they can
remember, they undoubtedly place all of them before the divine mercy
for pardon. But those who fail to do so and knowingly withhold some,
place nothing before the divine goodness for remission through the
mediation of the priest, "for if the sick person is too ashamed to show
his wound to the doctor, the medicine cannot heal what it does not
know."55
1457 According to the Church's command, "after having attained the
age of discretion, each of the faithful is bound by an obligation
faithfully to confess serious sins at least once a year."56 Anyone who is
aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy
Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having
first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a grave reason for
receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to
confession.57 Children must go to the sacrament of Penance before
receiving Holy Communion for the first time.58
1458 Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults
(venial sins) is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.59
Indeed the regular confession of our venial sins helps us form our
conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by
Christ and progress in the life of the Spirit. By receiving more
frequently through this sacrament the gift of the Father's mercy, we are
spurred to be merciful as he is merciful:60
Whoever confesses his sins . . . is already working with God. God
indicts your sins; if you also indict them, you are joined with God. Man
and sinner are, so to speak, two realities: when you hear "man" - this is
what God has made; when you hear "sinner" - this is what man himself
has made. Destroy what you have made, so that God may save what he
has made .... When you begin to abhor what you have made, it is then
that your good works are beginning, since you are accusing yourself of
your evil works. the beginning of good works is the confession of evil
works. You do the truth and come to the light.61
Satisfaction
1459 Many sins wrong our neighbor. One must do what is possible in
order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the
reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries).
Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the
sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbor.
Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin
has caused.62 Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full
spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin:
he must "make satisfaction for" or "expiate" his sins. This satisfaction is
also called "penance."
1460 The penance the confessor imposes must take into account the
penitent's personal situation and must seek his spiritual good. It must
correspond as far as possible with the gravity and nature of the sins
committed. It can consist of prayer, an offering, works of mercy,
service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, and above all the
patient acceptance of the cross we must bear. Such penances help
configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all. They
allow us to become co-heirs with the risen Christ, "provided we suffer
with him."63
The satisfaction that we make for our sins, however, is not so much
ours as though it were not done through Jesus Christ. We who can do
nothing ourselves, as if just by ourselves, can do all things with the
cooperation of "him who strengthens" us. Thus man has nothing of
which to boast, but all our boasting is in Christ . . . in whom we make
satisfaction by bringing forth "fruits that befit repentance." These fruits
have their efficacy from him, by him they are offered to the Father, and
through him they are accepted by the Father.64

VIII. The Minister of This Sacrament
1461 Since Christ entrusted to his apostles the ministry of
reconciliation,65 bishops who are their successors, and priests, the
bishops' collaborators, continue to exercise this ministry. Indeed
bishops and priests, by virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, have
the power to forgive all sins "in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit."
1462 Forgiveness of sins brings reconciliation with God, but also with
the Church. Since ancient times the bishop, visible head of a particular
Church, has thus rightfully been considered to be the one who
principally has the power and ministry of reconciliation: he is the
moderator of the penitential discipline.66 Priests, his collaborators,
exercise it to the extent that they have received the commission either
from their bishop (or religious superior) or the Pope, according to the
law of the Church.67
1463 Certain particularly grave sins incur excommunication, the most
severe ecclesiastical penalty, which impedes the reception of the
sacraments and the exercise of certain ecclesiastical acts, and for which
absolution consequently cannot be granted, according to canon law,
except by the Pope, the bishop of the place or priests authorized by
them.68 In danger of death any priest, even if deprived of faculties for
hearing confessions, can absolve from every sin and
excommunication.69
1464 Priests must encourage the faithful to come to the sacrament of
Penance and must make themselves available to celebrate this
sacrament each time Christians reasonably ask for it.70
1465 When he celebrates the sacrament of Penance, the priest is
fulfilling the ministry of the Good Shepherd who seeks the lost sheep,
of the Good Samaritan who binds up wounds, of the Father who
awaits the prodigal son and welcomes him on his return, and of the
just and impartial judge whose judgment is both just and merciful. the
priest is the sign and the instrument of God's merciful love for the
sinner.
1466 The confessor is not the master of God's forgiveness, but its
servant. the minister of this sacrament should unite himself to the
intention and charity of Christ.71 He should have a proven knowledge
of Christian behavior, experience of human affairs, respect and
sensitivity toward the one who has fallen; he must love the truth, be
faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, and lead the penitent with
patience toward healing and full maturity. He must pray and do
penance for his penitent, entrusting him to the Lord's mercy.
1467 Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect
due to persons, the Church declares that every priest who hears
confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep absolute
secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have confessed to him. He
can make no use of knowledge that confession gives him about
penitents' lives.72 This secret, which admits of no exceptions, is called
the "sacramental seal," because what the penitent has made known to
the priest remains "sealed" by the sacrament.

IX. The Effects of This Sacrament
1468 "The whole power of the sacrament of Penance consists in
restoring us to God's grace and joining us with him in an intimate
friendship."73 Reconciliation with God is thus the purpose and effect
of this sacrament. For those who receive the sacrament of Penance
with contrite heart and religious disposition, reconciliation "is usually
followed by peace and serenity of conscience with strong spiritual
consolation."74 Indeed the sacrament of Reconciliation with God
brings about a true "spiritual resurrection," restoration of the dignity
and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most
precious is friendship with God.75
1469 This sacrament reconciles us with the Church. Sin damages or
even breaks fraternal communion. the sacrament of Penance repairs or
restores it. In this sense it does not simply heal the one restored to
ecclesial communion, but has also a revitalizing effect on the life of the
Church which suffered from the sin of one of her members.76 Re-
established or strengthened in the communion of saints, the sinner is
made stronger by the exchange of spiritual goods among all the living
members of the Body of Christ, whether still on pilgrimage or already
in the heavenly homeland:77
It must be recalled that . . . this reconciliation with God leads, as it
were, to other reconciliations, which repair the other breaches caused
by sin. the forgiven penitent is reconciled with himself in his inmost
being, where he regains his innermost truth. He is reconciled with his
brethren whom he has in some way offended and wounded. He is
reconciled with the Church. He is reconciled with all creation.78
1470 In this sacrament, the sinner, placing himself before the merciful
judgment of God, anticipates in a certain way the judgment to which
he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life. For it is now, in this
life, that we are offered the choice between life and death, and it is only
by the road of conversion that we can enter the Kingdom, from which
one is excluded by grave sin.79 In converting to Christ through
penance and faith, the sinner passes from death to life and "does not
come into judgment."80

X. Indulgences
1471 The doctrine and practice of indulgences in the Church are
closely linked to the effects of the sacrament of Penance.
What is an indulgence?
"An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment
due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful
Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed
conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister of
redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the
satisfactions of Christ and the saints."81
"An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either part
or all of the temporal punishment due to sin."82 The faithful can gain
indulgences for themselves or apply them to the dead.82B
The punishments of sin
1472 To understand this doctrine and practice of the Church, it is
necessary to understand that sin has a double consequence. Grave sin
deprives us of communion with God and therefore makes us incapable
of eternal life, the privation of which is called the "eternal punishment"
of sin. On the other hand every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy
attachment to creatures, which must be purified either here on earth,
or after death in the state called Purgatory. This purification frees one
from what is called the "temporal punishment" of sin. These two
punishments must not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted
by God from without, but as following from the very nature of sin. A
conversion which proceeds from a fervent charity can attain the
complete purification of the sinner in such a way that no punishment
would remain.83
1473 The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God
entail the remission of the eternal punishment of sin, but temporal
punishment of sin remains. While patiently bearing sufferings and trials
of all kinds and, when the day comes, serenely facing death, the
Christian must strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a
grace. He should strive by works of mercy and charity, as well as by
prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off completely the
"old man" and to put on the "new man."84
In the Communion of Saints
1474 The Christian who seeks to purify himself of his sin and to
become holy with the help of God's grace is not alone. "The life of
each of God's children is joined in Christ and through Christ in a
wonderful way to the life of all the other Christian brethren in the
supernatural unity of the Mystical Body of Christ, as in a single
mystical person."85
1475 In the communion of saints, "a perennial link of charity exists
between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home,
those who are expiating their sins in purgatory and those who are still
pilgrims on earth. between them there is, too, an abundant exchange of
all good things."86 In this wonderful exchange, the holiness of one
profits others, well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause
others. Thus recourse to the communion of saints lets the contrite
sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments
for sin.
1476 We also call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the
Church's treasury, which is "not the sum total of the material goods
which have accumulated during the course of the centuries. On the
contrary the 'treasury of the Church' is the infinite value, which can
never be exhausted, which Christ's merits have before God. They were
offered so that the whole of mankind could be set free from sin and
attain communion with the Father. In Christ, the Redeemer himself,
the satisfactions and merits of his Redemption exist and find their
effficacy."87
1477 "This treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of the
Blessed Virgin Mary. They are truly immense, unfathomable, and even
pristine in their value before God. In the treasury, too, are the prayers
and good works of all the saints, all those who have followed in the
footsteps of Christ the Lord and by his grace have made their lives holy
and carried out the mission the Father entrusted to them. In this way
they attained their own salvation and at the same time cooperated in
saving their brothers in the unity of the Mystical Body."88
Obtaining indulgence from God through the Church
1478 An indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of
the power of binding and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus,
intervenes in favor of individual Christians and opens for them the
treasury of the merits of Christ and the saints to obtain from the
Father of mercies the remission of the temporal punishments due for
their sins. Thus the Church does not want simply to come to the aid of
these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion, penance,
and charity.89
1479 Since the faithful departed now being purified are also members
of the same communion of saints, one way we can help them is to
obtain indulgences for them, so that the temporal punishments due for
their sins may be remitted.

XI. The Celebration of the Sacrament of Penance
1480 Like all the sacraments, Penance is a liturgical action. the
elements of the celebration are ordinarily these: a greeting and blessing
from the priest, reading the word of God to illuminate the conscience
and elicit contrition, and an exhortation to repentance; the confession,
which acknowledges sins and makes them known to the priest; the
imposition and acceptance of a penance; the priest's absolution; a
prayer of thanksgiving and praise and dismissal with the blessing of the
priest.
1481 The Byzantine Liturgy recognizes several formulas of absolution,
in the form of invocation, which admirably express the mystery of
forgiveness: "May the same God, who through the Prophet Nathan
forgave David when he confessed his sins, who forgave Peter when he
wept bitterly, the prostitute when she washed his feet with her tears,
the publican, and the prodigal son, through me, a sinner, forgive you
both in this life and in the next and enable you to appear before his
awe-inspiring tribunal without condemnation, he who is blessed for
ever and ever. Amen."
1482 The sacrament of Penance can also take place in the framework
of a communal celebration in which we prepare ourselves together for
confession and give thanks together for the forgiveness received. Here,
the personal confession of sins and individual absolution are inserted
into a liturgy of the word of God with readings and a homily, an
examination of conscience conducted in common, a communal
request for forgiveness, the Our Father and a thanksgiving in common.
This communal celebration expresses more clearly the ecclesial
character of penance. However, regardless of its manner of celebration
the sacrament of Penance is always, by its very nature, a liturgical
action, and therefore an ecclesial and public action.90
1483 In case of grave necessity recourse may be had to a communal
celebration of reconciliation with general confession and general
absolution. Grave necessity of this sort can arise when there is
imminent danger of death without sufficient time for the priest or
priests to hear each penitent's confession. Grave necessity can also exist
when, given the number of penitents, there are not enough confessors
to hear individual confessions properly in a reasonable time, so that the
penitents through no fault of their own would be deprived of
sacramental grace or Holy Communion for a long time. In this case,
for the absolution to be valid the faithful must have the intention of
individually confessing their grave sins in the time required.91 The
diocesan bishop is the judge of whether or not the conditions required
for general absolution exist.92 A large gathering of the faithful on the
occasion of major feasts or pilgrimages does not constitute a case of
grave necessity.93
1484 "Individual, integral confession and absolution remain the only
ordinary way for the faithful to reconcile themselves with God and the
Church, unless physical or moral impossibility excuses from this kind
of confession."94 There are profound reasons for this. Christ is at work
in each of the sacraments. He personally addresses every sinner: "My
son, your sins are forgiven."95 He is the physician tending each one of
the sick who need him to cure them.96 He raises them up and
reintegrates them into fraternal communion. Personal confession is
thus the form most expressive of reconciliation with God and with the
Church.

IN BRIEF
1485 "On the evening of that day, the first day of the week," Jesus
showed himself to his apostles. "He breathed on them, and said to
them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are
forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained"' (Jn 20:19, 22-
23).
1486 The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is conferred by a
particular sacrament called the sacrament of conversion, confession,
penance, or reconciliation.
1487 The sinner wounds God's honor and love, his own human dignity
as a man called to be a son of God, and the spiritual well-being of the
Church, of which each Christian ought to be a living stone.
1488 To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and nothing has
worse consequences for sinners themselves, for the Church, and for the
whole world.
1489 To return to communion with God after having lost it through
sin is a process born of the grace of God who is rich in mercy and
solicitous for the salvation of men. One must ask for this precious gift
for oneself and for others.
1490 The movement of return to God, called conversion and
repentance, entails sorrow for and abhorrence of sins committed, and
the firm purpose of sinning no more in the future. Conversion touches
the past and the future and is nourished by hope in God's mercy.
1491 The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in three actions
of the penitent and the priest's absolution. the penitent's acts are
repentance, confession or disclosure of sins to the priest, and the
intention to make reparation and do works of reparation.
1492 Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by motives
that arise from faith. If repentance rises from love of charity for God, it
is called "perfect" contrition; if it is founded on other motives, it is
called "imperfect."
1493 One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the
Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed grave sins he
remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. the
confession of venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is
nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.
1494 The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of
"satisfaction" or "penance" to be performed by the penitent in order to
repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits befitting a
disciple of Christ.
1495 Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the
authority of the Church can forgive sins in the name of Christ.
1496 The spiritual effects of the sacrament of Penance are:
- reconciliation with God by which the penitent recovers grace;
- reconciliation with the Church;
- remission of the eternal punishment incurred by mortal sins;
- remission, at least in part, of temporal punishments resulting from
sin;
- peace and serenity of conscience, and spiritual consolation;
- an increase of spiritual strength for the Christian battle.
1497 Individual and integral confession of grave sins followed by
absolution remains the only ordinary means of reconciliation with God
and with the Church.
1498 Through indulgences the faithful can obtain the remission of
temporal punishment resulting from sin for themselves and also for the
souls in Purgatory.

I. Its Foundations in the Economy of Salvation
Illness in human life
1500 Illness and suffering have always been among the gravest
problems confronted in human life. In illness, man experiences his
powerlessness, his limitations, and his finitude. Every illness can make
us glimpse death.
1501 Illness can lead to anguish, self-absorption, sometimes even
despair and revolt against God. It can also make a person more
mature, helping him discern in his life what is not essential so that he
can turn toward that which is. Very often illness provokes a search for
God and a return to him.
The sick person before God
1502 The man of the Old Testament lives his sickness in the presence
of God. It is before God that he laments his illness, and it is of God,
Master of life and death, that he implores healing.98 Illness becomes a
way to conversion; God's forgiveness initiates the healing.99 It is the
experience of Israel that illness is mysteriously linked to sin and evil,
and that faithfulness to God according to his law restores life: "For I
am the Lord, your healer."100 The prophet intuits that suffering can
also have a redemptive meaning for the sins of others.101 Finally
Isaiah announces that God will usher in a time for Zion when he will
pardon every offense and heal every illness.102
Christ the physician
1503 Christ's compassion toward the sick and his many healings of
every kind of infirmity are a resplendent sign that "God has visited his
people"103 and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand. Jesus has
the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins;104 he has come to
heal the whole man, soul and body; he is the physician the sick have
need of.105 His compassion toward all who suffer goes so far that he
identifies himself with them: "I was sick and you visited me."106 His
preferential love for the sick has not ceased through the centuries to
draw the very special attention of Christians toward all those who
suffer in body and soul. It is the source of tireless efforts to comfort
them.
1504 Often Jesus asks the sick to believe.107 He makes use of signs to
heal: spittle and the laying on of hands,108 mud and washing.109 The
sick try to touch him, "for power came forth from him and healed
them all."110 and so in the sacraments Christ continues to "touch" us
in order to heal us.
1505 Moved by so much suffering Christ not only allows himself to be
touched by the sick, but he makes their miseries his own: "He took our
infirmities and bore our diseases."111 But he did not heal all the sick.
His healings were signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God. They
announced a more radical healing: the victory over sin and death
through his Passover. On the cross Christ took upon himself the whole
weight of evil and took away the "sin of the world,"112 of which illness
is only a consequence. By his passion and death on the cross Christ has
given a new meaning to suffering: it can henceforth configure us to
him and unite us with his redemptive Passion.
"Heal the sick . . ."
1506 Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their cross
in their turn.113 By following him they acquire a new outlook on
illness and the sick. Jesus associates them with his own life of poverty
and service. He makes them share in his ministry of compassion and
healing: "So they went out and preached that men should repent. and
they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick
and healed them."114
1507 The risen Lord renews this mission ("In my name . . . they will
lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."115) and confirms it
through the signs that the Church performs by invoking his name.116
These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is truly "God who
saves."117
1508 The Holy Spirit gives to some a special charism of healing118 so
as to make manifest the power of the grace of the risen Lord. But even
the most intense prayers do not always obtain the healing of all
illnesses. Thus St. Paul must learn from the Lord that "my grace is
sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness," and that
the sufferings to be endured can mean that "in my flesh I complete
what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his Body, that is,
the Church."119
1509 "Heal the sick!"120 The Church has received this charge from
the Lord and strives to carry it out by taking care of the sick as well as
by accompanying them with her prayer of intercession. She believes in
the life-giving presence of Christ, the physician of souls and bodies.
This presence is particularly active through the sacraments, and in an
altogether special way through the Eucharist, the bread that gives
eternal life and that St. Paul suggests is connected with bodily
health.121
1510 However, the apostolic Church has its own rite for the sick,
attested to by St. James: "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the
elders [presbyters] of the Church and let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith
will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has
committed sins, he will be forgiven."122 Tradition has recognized in
this rite one of the seven sacraments.123
A sacrament of the sick
1511 The Church believes and confesses that among the seven
sacraments there is one especially intended to strengthen those who
are being tried by illness, the Anointing of the Sick:
This sacred anointing of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord as a
true and proper sacrament of the New Testament. It is alluded to
indeed by Mark, but is recommended to the faithful and promulgated
by James the apostle and brother of the Lord.124
1512 From ancient times in the liturgical traditions of both East and
West, we have testimonies to the practice of anointings of the sick with
blessed oil. Over the centuries the Anointing of the Sick was conferred
more and more exclusively on those at the point of death. Because of
this it received the name "Extreme Unction." Notwithstanding this
evolution the liturgy has never failed to beg the Lord that the sick
person may recover his health if it would be conducive to his
salvation.125
1513 The Apostolic Constitution Sacram unctionem infirmorum,126
following upon the Second Vatican Council,127 established that
henceforth, in the Roman Rite, the following be observed:
The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given to those who are
seriously ill by anointing them on the forehead and hands with duly
blessed oil - pressed from olives or from other plants - saying, only
once: "Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you
from sin save you and raise you up."128

II. Who Receives and Who Administers This Sacrament?
In case of grave illness . . .
1514 The Anointing of the Sick "is not a sacrament for those only who
are at the point of death. Hence, as soon as anyone of the faithful
begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age, the fitting
time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly already
arrived."129
1515 If a sick person who received this anointing recovers his health,
he can in the case of another grave illness receive this sacrament again.
If during the same illness the person's condition becomes more serious,
the sacrament may be repeated. It is fitting to receive the Anointing of
the Sick just prior to a serious operation. the same holds for the elderly
whose frailty becomes more pronounced.
" . . . let him call for the presbyters of the Church"
1516 Only priests (bishops and presbyters) are ministers of the
Anointing of the Sick.130 It is the duty of pastors to instruct the
faithful on the benefits of this sacrament. the faithful should encourage
the sick to call for a priest to receive this sacrament. the sick should
prepare themselves to receive it with good dispositions, assisted by
their pastor and the whole ecclesial community, which is invited to
surround the sick in a special way through their prayers and fraternal
attention.

III. How is This Sacrament Celebrated?
1517 Like all the sacraments the Anointing of the Sick is a liturgical
and communal celebration,131 whether it takes place in the family
home, a hospital or church, for a single sick person or a whole group of
sick persons. It is very fitting to celebrate it within the Eucharist, the
memorial of the Lord's Passover. If circumstances suggest it, the
celebration of the sacrament can be preceded by the sacrament of
Penance and followed by the sacrament of the Eucharist. As the
sacrament of Christ's Passover the Eucharist should always be the last
sacrament of the earthly journey, the "viaticum" for "passing over" to
eternal life.
1518 Word and sacrament form an indivisible whole. the Liturgy of the
Word, preceded by an act of repentance, opens the celebration. the
words of Christ, the witness of the apostles, awaken the faith of the sick
person and of the community to ask the Lord for the strength of his
Spirit.
1519 The celebration of the sacrament includes the following principal
elements: the "priests of the Church"132 - in silence - lay hands on the
sick; they pray over them in the faith of the Church133 - this is the
epiclesis proper to this sacrament; they then anoint them with oil
blessed, if possible, by the bishop.
These liturgical actions indicate what grace this sacrament confers
upon the sick.

IV. The Effects of the Celebration of This Sacrament
1520 A particular gift of the Holy Spirit. the first grace of this
sacrament is one of strengthening, peace and courage to overcome the
difficulties that go with the condition of serious illness or the frailty of
old age. This grace is a gift of the Holy Spirit, who renews trust and
faith in God and strengthens against the temptations of the evil one,
the temptation to discouragement and anguish in the face of death.134
This assistance from the Lord by the power of his Spirit is meant to
lead the sick person to healing of the soul, but also of the body if such
is God's will.135 Furthermore, "if he has committed sins, he will be
forgiven."136
1521 Union with the passion of Christ. By the grace of this sacrament
the sick person receives the strength and the gift of uniting himself
more closely to Christ's Passion: in a certain way he is consecrated to
bear fruit by configuration to the Savior's redemptive Passion.
Suffering, a consequence of original sin, acquires a new meaning; it
becomes a participation in the saving work of Jesus.
1522 An ecclesial grace. the sick who receive this sacrament, "by freely
uniting themselves to the passion and death of Christ," "contribute to
the good of the People of God."137 By celebrating this sacrament the
Church, in the communion of saints, intercedes for the benefit of the
sick person, and he, for his part, though the grace of this sacrament,
contributes to the sanctification of the Church and to the good of all
men for whom the Church suffers and offers herself through Christ to
God the Father.
1523 A preparation for the final journey. If the sacrament of anointing
of the sick is given to all who suffer from serious illness and infirmity,
even more rightly is it given to those at the point of departing this life;
so it is also called sacramentum exeuntium (the sacrament of those
departing).138 The Anointing of the Sick completes our conformity to
the death and Resurrection of Christ, just as Baptism began it. It
completes the holy anointings that mark the whole Christian life: that
of Baptism which sealed the new life in us, and that of Confirmation
which strengthened us for the combat of this life. This last anointing
fortifies the end of our earthly life like a solid rampart for the final
struggles before entering the Father's house.139

V. Viaticum, the Last Sacrament of the Christian
1524 In addition to the Anointing of the Sick, the Church offers those
who are about to leave this life the Eucharist as viaticum. Communion
in the body and blood of Christ, received at this moment of "passing
over" to the Father, has a particular significance and importance. It is
the seed of eternal life and the power of resurrection, according to the
words of the Lord: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."140 The sacrament
of Christ once dead and now risen, the Eucharist is here the sacrament
of passing over from death to life, from this world to the Father.141
1525 Thus, just as the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the
Eucharist form a unity called "the sacraments of Christian initiation,"
so too it can be said that Penance, the Anointing of the Sick and the
Eucharist as viaticum constitute at the end of Christian life "the
sacraments that prepare for our heavenly homeland" or the sacraments
that complete the earthly pilgrimage.

IN BRIEF
1526 "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the presbyters of the
Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and
the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be
forgiven" (Jas 5:14-15).
1527 The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its purpose the
conferral of a special grace on the Christian experiencing the
difficulties inherent in the condition of grave illness or old age.
1528 The proper time for receiving this holy anointing has certainly
arrived when the believer begins to be in danger of death because of
illness or old age.
1529 Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive the
Anointing of the Sick, and also when, after he has received it, the
illness worsens.
1530 Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the sacrament of
the Anointing of the Sick, using oil blessed by the bishop, or if
necessary by the celebrating presbyter himself.
1531 The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists essentially
in the anointing of the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the
Roman Rite) or of other parts of the body (in the Eastern rite), the
anointing being accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant
asking for the special grace of this sacrament.
1532 The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick
has as its effects:
- the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own
good and that of the whole Church;
- the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian
manner the sufferings of illness or old age;
- the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it
through the sacrament of Penance;
- the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul;
- the preparation for passing over to eternal life.

CHAPTER THREE THE SACRAMENTS AT THE SERVICE OF
COMMUNION
1533 Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist are sacraments of
Christian initiation. They ground the common vocation of all Christ's
disciples, a vocation to holiness and to the mission of evangelizing the
world. They confer the graces needed for the life according to the
Spirit during this life as pilgrims on the march towards the homeland.
1534 Two other sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, are directed
towards the salvation of others; if they contribute as well to personal
salvation, it is through service to others that they do so. They confer a
particular mission in the Church and serve to build up the People of
God.
1535 Through these sacraments those already consecrated by Baptism
and Confirmation1 for the common priesthood of all the faithful can
receive particular consecrations. Those who receive the sacrament of
Holy Orders are consecrated in Christ's name "to feed the Church by
the word and grace of God."2 On their part, "Christian spouses are
fortified and, as it were, consecrated for the duties and dignity of their
state by a special sacrament."3

ARTICLE 6 THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS
1536 Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission
entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the
Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic
ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and
diaconate.
(On the institution and mission of the apostolic ministry by Christ, see
above, no. 874 ff. Here only the sacramental means by which this
ministry is handed on will be treated.)

ARTICLE 6 THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS




I. Why Is This Sacrament Called "Orders"?
1537 The word order in Roman antiquity designated an established
civil body, especially a governing body. Ordinatio means incorporation
into an ordo. In the Church there are established bodies which
Tradition, not without a basis in Sacred Scripture,4 has since ancient
times called taxeis (Greek) or ordines. And so the liturgy speaks of the
ordo episcoporum, the ordo presbyterorum, the ordo diaconorum.
Other groups also receive this name of ordo: catechumens, virgins,
spouses, widows,....
1538 Integration into one of these bodies in the Church was
accomplished by a rite called ordinatio, a religious and liturgical act
which was a consecration, a blessing or a sacrament. Today the word
"ordination" is reserved for the sacramental act which integrates a man
into the order of bishops, presbyters, or deacons, and goes beyond a
simple election, designation, delegation, or institution by the
community, for it confers a gift of the Holy Spirit that permits the
exercise of a "sacred power" (sacra potestas)5 which can come only
from Christ himself through his Church. Ordination is also called
consecratio, for it is a setting apart and an investiture by Christ himself
for his Church. the laying on of hands by the bishop, with the
consecratory prayer, constitutes the visible sign of this ordination.

II. The Sacrament of Holy Orders in the Economy of Salvation
The priesthood of the Old Covenant
1539 The chosen people was constituted by God as "a kingdom of
priests and a holy nation."6 But within the people of Israel, God chose
one of the twelve tribes, that of Levi, and set it apart for liturgical
service; God himself is its inheritance.7 A special rite consecrated the
beginnings of the priesthood of the Old Covenant. the priests are
"appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and
sacrifices for sins."8
1540 Instituted to proclaim the Word of God and to restore
communion with God by sacrifices and prayer,9 this priesthood
nevertheless remains powerless to bring about salvation, needing to
repeat its sacrifices ceaselessly and being unable to achieve a definitive
sanctification, which only the sacrifice of Christ would accomplish.10
1541 The liturgy of the Church, however, sees in the priesthood of
Aaron and the service of the Levites, as in the institution of the seventy
elders,11 a prefiguring of the ordained ministry of the New Covenant.
Thus in the Latin Rite the Church prays in the consecratory preface of
the ordination of bishops:
God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by your gracious word
you have established the plan of your Church.


From the beginning,
you chose the descendants of Abraham to be your holy nation.
You established rulers and priests
and did not leave your sanctuary without ministers to serve you....12
1542 At the ordination of priests, the Church prays:
Lord, holy Father, . . .
when you had appointed high priests to rule your people,
you chose other men next to them in rank and dignity
to be with them and to help them in their task....


you extended the spirit of Moses to seventy wise men....
You shared among the sons of Aaron
the fullness of their father's power.13
1543 In the consecratory prayer for ordination of deacons, the Church
confesses:
Almighty God . . ..
You make the Church, Christ's body,
grow to its full stature as a new and greater temple.
You enrich it with every kind of grace
and perfect it with a diversity of members
to serve the whole body in a wonderful pattern of unity.
You established a threefold ministry of worship and service,
for the glory of your name.
As ministers of your tabernacle you chose the sons of Levi
and gave them your blessing as their everlasting inheritance.14
The one priesthood of Christ
1544 Everything that the priesthood of the Old Covenant prefigured
finds its fulfillment in Christ Jesus, the "one mediator between God
and men."15 The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, "priest of
God Most High," as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the
unique "high priest after the order of Melchizedek";16 "holy,
blameless, unstained,"17 "by a single offering he has perfected for all
time those who are sanctified,"18 that is, by the unique sacrifice of the
cross.
1545 The redemptive sacrifice of Christ is unique, accomplished once
for all; yet it is made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the Church.
the same is true of the one priesthood of Christ; it is made present
through the ministerial priesthood without diminishing the uniqueness
of Christ's priesthood: "Only Christ is the true priest, the others being
only his ministers."19
Two participations in the one priesthood of Christ
1546 Christ, high priest and unique mediator, has made of the Church
"a kingdom, priests for his God and Father."20 The whole community
of believers is, as such, priestly. the faithful exercise their baptismal
priesthood through their participation, each according to his own
vocation, in Christ's mission as priest, prophet, and king. Through the
sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation the faithful are "consecrated
to be . . . a holy priesthood."21
1547 The ministerial or hierarchical priesthood of bishops and priests,
and the common priesthood of all the faithful participate, "each in its
own proper way, in the one priesthood of Christ." While being
"ordered one to another," they differ essentially.22 In what sense?
While the common priesthood of the faithful is exercised by the
unfolding of baptismal grace - a life of faith, hope, and charity, a life
according to the Spirit - ,the ministerial priesthood is at the service of
the common priesthood. It is directed at the unfolding of the baptismal
grace of all Christians. the ministerial priesthood is a means by which
Christ unceasingly builds up and leads his Church. For this reason it is
transmitted by its own sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders.


In the person of Christ the Head . . .
1548 In the ecclesial service of the ordained minister, it is Christ
himself who is present to his Church as Head of his Body, Shepherd of
his flock, high priest of the redemptive sacrifice, Teacher of Truth. This
is what the Church means by saying that the priest, by virtue of the
sacrament of Holy Orders, acts in persona Christi Capitis:23
It is the same priest, Christ Jesus, whose sacred person his minister
truly represents. Now the minister, by reason of the sacerdotal
consecration which he has received, is truly made like to the high priest
and possesses the authority to act in the power and place of the person
of Christ himself (virtute ac persona ipsius Christi).24
Christ is the source of all priesthood: the priest of the old law was a
figure of Christ, and the priest of the new law acts in the person of
Christ.25
1549 Through the ordained ministry, especially that of bishops and
priests, the presence of Christ as head of the Church is made visible in
the midst of the community of believers.26 In the beautiful expression
of St. Ignatius of Antioch, the bishop is typos tou Patros: he is like the
living image of God the Father.27
1550 This presence of Christ in the minister is not to be understood as
if the latter were preserved from all human weaknesses, the spirit of
domination, error, even sin. the power of the Holy Spirit does not
guarantee all acts of ministers in the same way. While this guarantee
extends to the sacraments, so that even the minister's sin cannot
impede the fruit of grace, in many other acts the minister leaves human
traces that are not always signs of fidelity to the Gospel and
consequently can harm the apostolic fruitfulness of the Church.
1551 This priesthood is ministerial. "That office . . . which the Lord
committed to the pastors of his people, is in the strict sense of the term
a service."28 It is entirely related to Christ and to men. It depends
entirely on Christ and on his unique priesthood; it has been instituted
for the good of men and the communion of the Church. the sacrament
of Holy Orders communicates a "sacred power" which is none other
than that of Christ. the exercise of this authority must therefore be
measured against the model of Christ, who by love made himself the
least and the servant of all.29 "The Lord said clearly that concern for
his flock was proof of love for him."30
. . . "in the name of the whole Church"
1552 The ministerial priesthood has the task not only of representing
Christ - Head of the Church - before the assembly of the faithful, but
also of acting in the name of the whole Church when presenting to
God the prayer of the Church, and above all when offering the
Eucharistic sacrifice.31
1553 "In the name of the whole Church" does not mean that priests
are the delegates of the community. the prayer and offering of the
Church are inseparable from the prayer and offering of Christ, her
head; it is always the case that Christ worships in and through his
Church. the whole Church, the Body of Christ, prays and offers herself
"through him, with him, in him," in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to
God the Father. the whole Body, caput et membra, prays and offers
itself, and therefore those who in the Body are especially his ministers
are called ministers not only of Christ, but also of the Church. It is
because the ministerial priesthood represents Christ that it can
represent the Church.

III. The Three Degrees of the Sacrament of Holy Orders
1554 "The divinely instituted ecclesiastical ministry is exercised in
different degrees by those who even from ancient times have been
called bishops, priests, and deacons."32 Catholic doctrine, expressed in
the liturgy, the Magisterium, and the constant practice of the Church,
recognizes that there are two degrees of ministerial participation in the
priesthood of Christ: the episcopacy and the presbyterate . the
diaconate is intended to help and serve them. For this reason the term
sacerdos in current usage denotes bishops and priests but not deacons.
Yet Catholic doctrine teaches that the degrees of priestly participation
(episcopate and presbyterate) and the degree of service (diaconate) are
all three conferred by a sacramental act called "ordination," that is, by
the sacrament of Holy Orders:
Let everyone revere the deacons as Jesus Christ, the bishop as the
image of the Father, and the presbyters as the senate of God and the
assembly of the apostles. For without them one cannot speak of the
Church.33
Episcopal ordination - fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders
1555 "Amongst those various offices which have been exercised in the
Church from the earliest times the chief place, according to the witness
of tradition, is held by the function of those who, through their
appointment to the dignity and responsibility of bishop, and in virtue
consequently of the unbroken succession going back to the beginning,
are regarded as transmitters of the apostolic line."34
1556 To fulfil their exalted mission, "the apostles were endowed by
Christ with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon them,
and by the imposition of hands they passed on to their auxiliaries the
gift of the Spirit, which is transmitted down to our day through
episcopal consecration."35
1557 The Second Vatican Council "teaches . . . that the fullness of the
sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by episcopal consecration, that
fullness namely which, both in the liturgical tradition of the Church
and the language of the Fathers of the Church, is called the high
priesthood, the acme (summa) of the sacred ministry."36
1558 "Episcopal consecration confers, together with the office of
sanctifying, also the offices of teaching and ruling.... In fact ... by the
imposition of hands and through the words of the consecration, the
grace of the Holy Spirit is given, and a sacred character is impressed in
such wise that bishops, in an eminent and visible manner, take the
place of Christ himself, teacher, shepherd, and priest, and act as his
representative (in Eius persona agant)."37 "By virtue, therefore, of the
Holy Spirit who has been given to them, bishops have been constituted
true and authentic teachers of the faith and have been made pontiffs
and pastors."38
1559 "One is constituted a member of the episcopal body in virtue of
the sacramental consecration and by the hierarchical communion with
the head and members of the college."39 The character and collegial
nature of the episcopal order are evidenced among other ways by the
Church's ancient practice which calls for several bishops to participate
in the consecration of a new bishop.40 In our day, the lawful
ordination of a bishop requires a special intervention of the Bishop of
Rome, because he is the supreme visible bond of the communion of
the particular Churches in the one Church and the guarantor of their
freedom.
1560 As Christ's vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the
particular Church entrusted to him, but at the same time he bears
collegially with all his brothers in the episcopacy the solicitude for all
the Churches: "Though each bishop is the lawful pastor only of the
portion of the flock entrusted to his care, as a legitimate successor of
the apostles he is, by divine institution and precept, responsible with
the other bishops for the apostolic mission of the Church."41
1561 The above considerations explain why the Eucharist celebrated
by the bishop has a quite special significance as an expression of the
Church gathered around the altar, with the one who represents Christ,
the Good Shepherd and Head of his Church, presiding.42
The ordination of priests - co-workers of the bishops
1562 "Christ, whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world, has,
through his apostles, made their successors, the bishops namely,
sharers in his consecration and mission; and these, in their turn, duly
entrusted in varying degrees various members of the Church with the
office of their ministry."43 "The function of the bishops' ministry was
handed over in a subordinate degree to priests so that they might be
appointed in the order of the priesthood and be co-workers of the
episcapal order for the proper fulfillment of the apostolic mission that
had been entrusted to it by Christ."44
1563 "Because it is joined with the episcopal order the office of priests
shares in the authority by which Christ himself builds up and sanctifies
and rules his Body. Hence the priesthood of priests, while
presupposing the sacraments of initiation, is nevertheless conferred by
its own particular sacrament. Through that sacrament priests by the
anointing of the Holy Spirit are signed with a special character and so
are configured to Christ the priest in such a way that they are able to
act in the person of Christ the head."45
1564 "Whilst not having the supreme degree of the pontifical office,
and notwithstanding the fact that they depend on the bishops in the
exercise of their own proper power, the priests are for all that
associated with them by reason of their sacerdotal dignity; and in
virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, after the image of Christ, the
supreme and eternal priest, they are consecrated in order to preach the
Gospel and shepherd the faithful as well as to celebrate divine worship
as true priests of the New Testament."46
1565 Through the sacrament of Holy Orders priests share in the
universal dimensions of the mission that Christ entrusted to the
apostles. the spiritual gift they have received in ordination prepares
them, not for a limited and restricted mission, "but for the fullest, in
fact the universal mission of salvation 'to the end of the earth,"'47
"prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel everywhere."48
1566 "It is in the Eucharistic cult or in the Eucharistic assembly of the
faithful (synaxis) that they exercise in a supreme degree their sacred
office; there, acting in the person of Christ and proclaiming his
mystery, they unite the votive offerings of the faithful to the sacrifice of
Christ their head, and in the sacrifice of the Mass they make present
again and apply, until the coming of the Lord, the unique sacrifice of
the New Testament, that namely of Christ offering himself once for all
a spotless victim to the Father."49 From this unique sacrifice their
whole priestly ministry draws its strength.50
1567 "The priests, prudent cooperators of the episcopal college and its
support and instrument, called to the service of the People of God,
constitute, together with their bishop, a unique sacerdotal college
(presbyterium) dedicated, it is, true to a variety of distinct duties. In
each local assembly of the faithful they represent, in a certain sense,
the bishop, with whom they are associated in all trust and generosity;
in part they take upon themselves his duties and solicitude and in their
daily toils discharge them."51 priests can exercise their ministry only in
dependence on the bishop and in communion with him. the promise of
obedience they make to the bishop at the moment of ordination and
the kiss of peace from him at the end of the ordination liturgy mean
that the bishop considers them his co-workers, his sons, his brothers
and his friends, and that they in return owe him love and obedience.
1568 "All priests, who are constituted in the order of priesthood by the
sacrament of Order, are bound together by an intimate sacramental
brotherhood, but in a special way they form one priestly body in the
diocese to which they are attached under their own bishop. . ;"52 The
unity of the presbyterium finds liturgical expression in the custom of
the presbyters' imposing hands, after the bishop, during the Ate of
ordination.
The ordination of deacons - "in order to serve"
1569 "At a lower level of the hierarchy are to be found deacons, who
receive the imposition of hands 'not unto the priesthood, but unto the
ministry."'53 At an ordination to the diaconate only the bishop lays
hands on the candidate, thus signifying the deacon's special attachment
to the bishop in the tasks of his "diakonia."54
1570 Deacons share in Christ's mission and grace in a special way.55
The sacrament of Holy Orders marks them with an imprint
(“character") which cannot be removed and which configures them to
Christ, who made himself the "deacon" or servant of all.56 Among
other tasks, it is the task of deacons to assist the bishop and priests in
the celebration of the divine mysteries, above all the Eucharist, in the
distribution of Holy Communion, in assisting at and blessing
marriages, in the proclamation of the Gospel and preaching, in
presiding over funerals, and in dedicating themselves to the various
ministries of charity.57
1571 Since the Second Vatican Council the Latin Church has restored
the diaconate "as a proper and permanent rank of the hierarchy,"58
while the Churches of the East had always maintained it. This
permanent diaconate, which can be conferred on married men,
constitutes an important enrichment for the Church's mission. Indeed
it is appropriate and useful that men who carry out a truly diaconal
ministry in the Church, whether in its liturgical and pastoral life or
whether in its social and charitable works, should "be strengthened by
the imposition of hands which has come down from the apostles. They
would be more closely bound to the altar and their ministry would be
made more fruitful through the sacramental grace of the diaconate."59

IV. The Celebration of This Sacrament
1572 Given the importance that the ordination of a bishop, a priest, or
a deacon has for the life of the particular Church, its celebration calls
for as many of the faithful as possible to take part. It should take place
preferably on Sunday, in the cathedral, with solemnity appropriate to
the occasion. All three ordinations, of the bishop, of the pRiest, and of
the deacon, follow the same movement. Their proper place is within
the Eucharistic liturgy.
1573 The essential rite of the sacrament of Holy Orders for all three
degrees consists in the bishop's imposition of hands on the head of the
ordinand and in the bishop's specific consecratory prayer asking God
for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and his gifts proper to the
ministry to which the candidate is being ordained.60
1574 As in all the sacraments additional rites surround the celebration.
Varying greatly among the different liturgical traditions, these rites
have in common the expression of the multiple aspects of sacramental
grace. Thus in the Latin Church, the initial rites - presentation and
election of the ordinand, instruction by the bishop, examination of the
candidate, litany of the saints - attest that the choice of the candidate is
made in keeping with the practice of the Church and prepare for the
solemn act of consecration, after which several rites syrnbolically
express and complete the mystery accomplished: for bishop and priest,
an anointing with holy chrism, a sign of the special anointing of the
Holy Spirit who makes their ministry fruitful; giving the book of the
Gospels, the ring, the miter, and the crosier to the bishop as the sign of
his apostolic mission to proclaim the Word of God, of his fidelity to the
Church, the bride of Christ, and his office as shepherd of the Lord's
flock; presentation to the priest of the paten and chalice, "the offering
of the holy people" which he is called to present to God; giving the
book of the Gospels to the deacon who has just received the mission to
proclaim the Gospel of Christ.

V. Who Can Confer This Sacrament?
1575 Christ himself chose the apostles and gave them a share in his
mission and authority. Raised to the Father's right hand, he has not
forsaken his flock but he keeps it under his constant protection
through the apostles, and guides it still through these same pastors
who continue his work today.61 Thus, it is Christ whose gift it is that
some be apostles, others pastors. He continues to act through the
bishops.62
1576 Since the sacrament of Holy Orders is the sacrament of the
apostolic ministry, it is for the bishops as the successors of the apostles
to hand on the "gift of the Spirit,"63 The "apostolic line."64 Validly
ordained bishops, i.e., those who are in the line of apostolic succession,
validly confer the three degrees of the sacrament of Holy Orders.65

VI. Who Can Receive This Sacrament?
1577 "Only a baptized man (vir) validly receives sacred ordination."66
The Lord Jesus chose men (viri) to form the college of the twelve
apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose collaborators
to succeed them in their ministry.67 The college of bishops, with
whom the priests are united in the priesthood, makes the college of the
twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality until Christ's return. the
Church recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the
Lord himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not
possible.68
1578 No one has a right to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders.
Indeed no one claims this office for himself; he is called to it by
God.69 Anyone who thinks he recognizes the signs of God's call to the
ordained ministry must humbly submit his desire to the authority of
the Church, who has the responsibility and right to call someone to
receive orders. Like every grace this sacrament can be received only as
an unmerited gift.
1579 All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the
exception of permanent deacons, are normally chosen from among
men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain celibate
"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."70 Called to consecrate
themselves with undivided heart to the Lord and to "the affairs of the
Lord,"71 they give themselves entirely to God and to men. Celibacy is
a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church's minister is
consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims
the Reign of God.72
1580 In the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force
for many centuries: while bishops are chosen solely from among
celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and priests. This
practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a
fruitful ministry within their communities.73 Moreover, priestly
celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many
priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the
East as in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of
Holy Orders can no longer marry.

VII. The Effects of the Sacrament of Holy Orders
The indelible character
1581 This sacrament configures the recipient to Christ by a special
grace of the Holy Spirit, so that he may serve as Christ's instrument for
his Church. By ordination one is enabled to act as a representative of
Christ, Head of the Church, in his triple office of priest, prophet, and
king.
1582 As in the case of Baptism and Confirmation this share in Christ's
office is granted once for all. the sacrament of Holy Orders, like the
other two, confers an indelible spiritual character and cannot be
repeated or conferred temporarily.74
1583 It is true that someone validly ordained can, for grave reason, be
discharged from the obligations and functions linked to ordination, or
can be forbidden to exercise them; but he cannot become a layman
again in the strict sense,75 because the character imprinted by
ordination is for ever. The vocation and mission received on the day of
his ordination mark him permanently.
1584 Since it is ultimately Christ who acts and effects salvation
through the ordained minister, the unworthiness of the latter does not
prevent Christ from acting.76 St. Augustine states this forcefully:
As for the proud minister, he is to be ranked with the devil. Christ's gift
is not thereby profaned: what flows through him keeps its purity, and
what passes through him remains dear and reaches the fertile earth....
the spiritual power of the sacrament is indeed comparable to light:
those to be enlightened receive it in its purity, and if it should pass
through defiled beings, it is not itself defiled.77
The grace of the Holy Spirit
1585 The grace of the Holy Spirit proper to this sacrament is
configuration to Christ as Priest, Teacher, and Pastor, of whom the
ordained is made a minister.
1586 For the bishop, this is first of all a grace of strength (“the
governing spirit": Prayer of Episcopal Consecration in the Latin
rite):78 The grace to guide and defend his Church with strength and
prudence as a father and pastor, with gratuitous love for all and a
preferential love for the poor, the sick, and the needy. This grace impels
him to proclaim the Gospel to all, to be the model for his flock, to go
before it on the way of sanctification by identifying himself in the
Eucharist with Christ the priest and victim, not fearing to give his life
for his sheep:
Father, you know all hearts.
You have chosen your servant for the office of bishop.
May he be a shepherd to your holy flock,
and a high priest blameless in your sight,
ministering to you night and day;
may he always gain the blessing of your favor
and offer the gifts of your holy Church.
Through the Spirit who gives the grace of high priesthood grant him
the power
to forgive sins as you have commanded
to assign ministries as you have decreed
and to loose from every bond by the authority which you
gave to your apostles. May he be pleasing to you by his gentleness and
purity of heart,
presenting a fragrant offering to you,
through Jesus Christ, your Son....79
1587 The spiritual gift conferred by presbyteral ordination is expressed
by this prayer of the Byzantine Rite. the bishop, while laying on his
hand, says among other things:
Lord, fill with the gift of the Holy Spirit
him whom you have deigned to raise to the rank of the priesthood,
that he may be worthy to stand without reproach before your altar
to proclaim the Gospel of your kingdom,
to fulfill the ministry of your word of truth,
to offer you spiritual gifts and sacrifices,
to renew your people by the bath of rebirth;
so that he may go out to meet our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
your only Son,
on the day of his second coming,
and may receive from your vast goodness
the recompense for a faithful administration of his order.80
1588 With regard to deacons, "strengthened by sacramental grace they
are dedicated to the People of God, in conjunction with the bishop and
his body of priests, in the service (diakonia) of the liturgy, of the
Gospel, and of works of charity."81
1589 Before the grandeur of the priestly grace and office, the holy
doctors felt an urgent call to conversion in order to conform their
whole lives to him whose sacrament had made them ministers. Thus
St. Gregory of Nazianzus, as a very young priest, exclaimed:
We must begin by purifying ourselves before purifying others; we must
be instructed to be able to instruct, become light to illuminate, draw
close to God to bring him close to others, be sanctified to sanctify, lead
by the hand and counsel prudently. I know whose ministers we are,
where we find ourselves and to where we strive. I know God's greatness
and man's weakness, but also his potential. [Who then is the priest? He
is] the defender of truth, who stands with angels, gives glory with
archangels, causes sacrifices to rise to the altar on high, shares Christ's
priesthood, refashions creation, restores it in God's image, recreates it
for the world on high and, even greater, is divinized and divinizes.82
and the holy Cure of Ars: "The priest continues the work of
redemption on earth.... If we really understood the priest on earth, we
would die not of fright but of love.... the Priesthood is the love of the
heart of Jesus."83

ARTICLE 6 THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS
IN BRIEF
1590 St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: "I remind you to rekindle
the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands"
(2Tim 1:6), and "If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a
noble task." (1 Tim 3:1) To Titus he said: "This is why I left you in
Crete, that you amend what was defective, and appoint presbyters in
every town, as I directed you" (Titus 1:5).
1591 The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Baptism all the
faithful share in the priesthood of Christ. This participation is called
the "common priesthood of the faithful." Based on this common
priesthood and ordered to its service, there exists another participation
in the mission of Christ: the ministry conferred by the sacrament of
Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the name and in the person
of Christ the Head in the midst of the community.
1592 The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the common
priesthood of the faithful because it confers a sacred power for the
service of the faithful. the ordained ministers exercise their service for
the People of God by teaching (munus docendi), divine worship
(munus liturgicum) and pastoral governance (munus regendi).
1593 Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been conferred
and exercised in three degrees: that of bishops, that of presbyters, and
that of deacons. the ministries conferred by ordination are
irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without the
bishop, presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the Church (cf
St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trall. 3,1).
1594 The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders,
which integrates him into the episcopal college and makes him the
visible head of the particular Church entrusted to him. As successors
of the apostles and members of the college, the bishops share in the
apostolic responsibility and mission of the whole Church under the
authority of the Pope, successor of St. Peter.
1595 Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at
the same time depend on them in the exercise of their pastoral
functions; they are called to be the bishops' prudent co-workers. They
form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears responsibility
with him for the particular Church. They receive from the bishop the
charge of a parish community or a determinate ecclesial office.
1596 Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of the
Church; they do not receive the ministerial priesthood, but ordination
confers on them important functions in the ministry of the word,
divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks
which they must carry out under the pastoral authority of their bishop.
1597 The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of
hands followed by a solemn prayer of consecration asking God to grant
the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit required for his ministry.
Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental character.
1598 The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only on
baptized men (viri), whose suitability for the exercise of the ministry
has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has the
responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of
Holy Orders.
1599 In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the
presbyterate is normally conferred only on candidates who are ready to
embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest their intention of
staying celibate for the love of God's kingdom and the service of men.
1600 It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders in the
three degrees.

1602 Sacred Scripture begins with the creation of man and woman in
the image and likeness of God and concludes with a vision of "the
wedding-feast of the Lamb."85 Scripture speaks throughout of
marriage and its "mystery," its institution and the meaning God has
given it, its origin and its end, its various realizations throughout the
history of salvation, the difficulties arising from sin and its renewal "in
the Lord" in the New Covenant of Christ and the Church.86
Marriage in the order of creation
1603 "The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the
married state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him
with its own proper laws.... God himself is the author of marriage."87
The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and
woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a
purely human institution despite the many variations it may have
undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures,
and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget
its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this
institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity,88 some
sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures.
"The well-being of the individual person and of both human and
Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal
and family life."89
1604 God who created man out of love also calls him to love the
fundamental and innate vocation of every human being. For man is
created in the image and likeness of God who is himself love.90 Since
God created him man and woman, their mutual love becomes an
image of the absolute and unfailing love with which God loves man. It
is good, very good, in the Creator's eyes. and this love which God
blesses is intended to be fruitful and to be realized in the common
work of watching over creation: "and God blessed them, and God said
to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it.'"91
1605 Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one
another: "It is not good that the man should be alone."92 The woman,
"flesh of his flesh," his equal, his nearest in all things, is given to him by
God as a "helpmate"; she thus represents God from whom comes our
help.93 "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves
to his wife, and they become one flesh."94 The Lord himself shows
that this signifies an unbreakable union of their two lives by recalling
what the plan of the Creator had been "in the beginning": "So they are
no longer two, but one flesh."95
Marriage under the regime of sin
1606 Every man experiences evil around him and within himself. This
experience makes itself felt in the relationships between man and
woman. Their union has always been threatened by discord, a spirit of
domination, infidelity, jealousy, and conflicts that can escalate into
hatred and separation. This disorder can manifest itself more or less
acutely, and can be more or less overcome according to the
circumstances of cultures, eras, and individuals, but it does seem to
have a universal character.
1607 According to faith the disorder we notice so painfully does not
stem from the nature of man and woman, nor from the nature of their
relations, but from sin. As a break with God, the first sin had for its
first consequence the rupture of the original communion between man
and woman. Their relations were distorted by mutual
recriminations;96 their mutual attraction, the Creator's own gift,
changed into a relationship of domination and lust;97 and the
beautiful vocation of man and woman to be fruitful, multiply, and
subdue the earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the toil of
work.98
1608 Nevertheless, the order of creation persists, though seriously
disturbed. To heal the wounds of sin, man and woman need the help of
the grace that God in his infinite mercy never refuses them.99 Without
his help man and woman cannot achieve the union of their lives for
which God created them "in the beginning."
Marriage under the pedagogy of the Law
1609 In his mercy God has not forsaken sinful man. the punishments
consequent upon sin, "pain in childbearing" and toil "in the sweat of
your brow,"100 also embody remedies that limit the damaging effects
of sin. After the fall, marriage helps to overcome self-absorption,
egoism, pursuit of one's own pleasure, and to open oneself to the other,
to mutual aid and to self-giving.
1610 Moral conscience concerning the unity and indissolubility of
marriage developed under the pedagogy of the old law. In the Old
Testament the polygamy of patriarchs and kings is not yet explicitly
rejected. Nevertheless, the law given to Moses aims at protecting the
wife from arbitrary domination by the husband, even though according
to the Lord's words it still carries traces of man's "hardness of heart"
which was the reason Moses permitted men to divorce their wives.101
1611 Seeing God's covenant with Israel in the image of exclusive and
faithful married love, the prophets prepared the Chosen People's
conscience for a deepened understanding of the unity and
indissolubility of marriage.102 The books of Ruth and Tobit bear
moving witness to an elevated sense of marriage and to the fidelity and
tenderness of spouses. Tradition has always seen in the Song of
Solomon a unique expression of human love, insofar as it is a reflection
of God's love - a love "strong as death" that "many waters cannot
quench."103
Marriage in the Lord
1612 The nuptial covenant between God and his people Israel had
prepared the way for the new and everlasting covenant in which the
Son of God, by becoming incarnate and giving his life, has united to
himself in a certain way all mankind saved by him, thus preparing for
"the wedding-feast of the Lamb."104
1613 On the threshold of his public life Jesus performs his first sign -
at his mother's request - during a wedding feast.105 The Church
attaches great importance to Jesus' presence at the wedding at Cana.
She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the
proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of
Christ's presence.
1614 In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning
of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the
beginning permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a
concession to the hardness of hearts.106 The matrimonial union of
man and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it "what
therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder."107
1615 This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage
bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand
impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a
burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the Law of
Moses.108 By coming to restore the original order of creation
disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live
marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following
Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses
will be able to "receive" the original meaning of marriage and live it
with the help of Christ.109 This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit
of Christ's cross, the source of all Christian life.
1616 This is what the Apostle Paul makes clear when he says:
"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her, that he might sanctify her," adding at once: "'For
this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his
wife, and the two shall become one. This is a great mystery, and I mean
in reference to Christ and the Church."110
1617 The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of
Christ and the Church. Already Baptism, the entry into the People of
God, is a nuptial mystery; it is so to speak the nuptial bath111 which
precedes the wedding feast, the Eucharist. Christian marriage in its
turn becomes an efficacious sign, the sacrament of the covenant of
Christ and the Church. Since it signifies and communicates grace,
marriage between baptized persons is a true sacrament of the New
Covenant.112
Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom
1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. the bond with him takes
precedence over all other bonds, familial or social.113 From the very
beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have
renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he
goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and
to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming.114 Christ himself
has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he
remains the model:
"For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are
eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs
who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of
heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."115
1619 Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an unfolding of
baptismal grace, a powerful sign of the supremacy of the bond with
Christ and of the ardent expectation of his return, a sign which also
recalls that marriage is a reality of this present age which is passing
away.116
1620 Both the sacrament of Matrimony and virginity for the Kingdom
of God come from the Lord himself. It is he who gives them meaning
and grants them the grace which is indispensable for living them out in
conformity with his will.117 Esteem of virginity for the sake of the
kingdom118 and the Christian understanding of marriage are
inseparable, and they reinforce each other:
Whoever denigrates marriage also diminishes the glory of virginity.
Whoever praises it makes virginity more admirable and resplendent.
What appears good only in comparison with evil would not be truly
good. the most excellent good is something even better than what is
admitted to be good.119

II. The Celebration of Marriage
1621 In the Latin Rite the celebration of marriage between two
Catholic faithful normally takes place during Holy Mass, because of
the connection of all the sacraments with the Paschal mystery of
Christ.120 In the Eucharist the memorial of the New Covenant is
realized, the New Covenant in which Christ has united himself for ever
to the Church, his beloved bride for whom he gave himself up.121 It is
therefore fitting that the spouses should seal their consent to give
themselves to each other through the offering of their own lives by
uniting it to the offering of Christ for his Church made present in the
Eucharistic sacrifice, and by receiving the Eucharist so that,
communicating in the same Body and the same Blood of Christ, they
may form but "one body" in Christ.122
1622 "Inasmuch as it is a sacramental action of sanctification, the
liturgical celebration of marriage . . . must be, per se, valid, worthy, and
fruitful."123 It is therefore appropriate for the bride and groom to
prepare themselves for the celebration of their marriage by receiving
the sacrament of penance.
1623 According to the Latin tradition, the spouses, as ministers of
Christ's grace, mutually confer upon each other the sacrament of
Matrimony by expressing their consent before the Church. In the
traditions of the Eastern Churches, the priests (bishops or presbyters)
are witnesses to the mutual consent given by the spouses, 123B but for
the validity of the sacrament their blessing is also necessary..123T
1624 The various liturgies abound in prayers of blessing and epiclesis
asking God's grace and blessing on the new couple, especially the
bride. In the epiclesis of this sacrament the spouses receive the Holy
Spirit as the communion of love of Christ and the Church.124 The
Holy Spirit is the seal of their covenant, the ever available source of
their love and the strength to renew their fidelity.

III. Matrimonial Consent
1625 The parties to a marriage covenant are a baptized man and
woman, free to contract marriage, who freely express their consent; "to
be free" means:
- not being under constraint;
- not impeded by any natural or ecclesiastical law.
1626 The Church holds the exchange of consent between the spouses
to be the indispensable element that "makes the marriage."125 If
consent is lacking there is no marriage.
1627 The consent consists in a "human act by which the partners
mutually give themselves to each other": "I take you to be my wife" - "I
take you to be my husband."126 This consent that binds the spouses to
each other finds its fulfillment in the two "becoming one flesh."127
1628 The consent must be an act of the will of each of the contracting
parties, free of coercion or grave external fear.128 No human power
can substitute for this consent.129 If this freedom is lacking the
marriage is invalid.
1629 For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage
null and void) the Church, after an examination of the situation by the
competent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage,
i.e., that the marriage never existed.130 In this case the contracting
parties are free to marry, provided the natural obligations of a previous
union are discharged.131
1630 The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a
marriage receives the consent of the spouses in the name of the
Church and gives the blessing of the Church. the presence of the
Church's minister (and also of the witnesses) visibly expresses the fact
that marriage is an ecclesial reality.
1631 This is the reason why the Church normally requires that the
faithful contract marriage according to the ecclesiastical form. Several
reasons converge to explain this requirement:132
- Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate
that it should be celebrated in the public liturgy of the Church;
- Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights
and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their
children; - Since marriage is a state of life in the Church, certainty
about it is necessary (hence the obligation to have witnesses);
- the public character of the consent protects the "I do" once given and
helps the spouses remain faithful to it.
1632 So that the "I do" of the spouses may be a free and responsible
act and so that the marriage covenant may have solid and lasting
human and Christian foundations, preparation for marriage is of prime
importance.
The example and teaching given by parents and families remain the
special form of this preparation.
The role of pastors and of the Christian community as the "family of
God" is indispensable for the transmission of the human and Christian
values of marriage and family,133 and much more so in our era when
many young people experience broken homes which no longer
sufficiently assure this initiation:


It is imperative to give suitable and timely instruction to young people,
above all in the heart of their own families, about the dignity of
married love, its role and its exercise, so that, having learned the value
of chastity, they will be able at a suitable age to engage in honorable
courtship and enter upon a marriage of their own.134
Mixed marriages and disparity of cult
1633 In many countries the situation of a mixed marriage (marriage
between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic) often arises. It
requires particular attention on the part of couples and their pastors. A
case of marriage with disparity of cult (between a Catholic and a
nonbaptized person) requires even greater circumspection.
1634 Difference of confession between the spouses does not constitute
an insurmountable obstacle for marriage, when they succeed in placing
in common what they have received from their respective communities,
and learn from each other the way in which each lives in fidelity to
Christ. But the difficulties of mixed marriages must not be
underestimated. They arise from the fact that the separation of
Christians has not yet been overcome. the spouses risk experiencing
the tragedy of Christian disunity even in the heart of their own home.
Disparity of cult can further aggravate these difficulties. Differences
about faith and the very notion of marriage, but also different religious
mentalities, can become sources of tension in marriage, especially as
regards the education of children. the temptation to religious
indifference can then arise.
1635 According to the law in force in the Latin Church, a mixed
marriage needs for liceity the express permission of ecclesiastical
authority.135 In case of disparity of cult an express dispensation from
this impediment is required for the validity of the marriage.136 This
permission or dispensation presupposes that both parties know and do
not exclude the essential ends and properties of marriage, and
furthermore that the Catholic party confirms the obligations, which
have been made known to the non-Catholic party, of preserving his or
her own faith and ensuring the baptism and education of the children
in the Catholic Church.137
1636 Through ecumenical dialogue Christian communities in many
regions have been able to put into effect a common pastoral practice
for mixed marriages. Its task is to help such couples live out their
particular situation in the light of faith, overcome the tensions between
the couple's obligations to each other and towards their ecclesial
communities, and encourage the flowering of what is common to them
in faith and respect for what separates them.
1637 In marriages with disparity of cult the Catholic spouse has a
particular task: "For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through
his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her
husband."138 It is a great joy for the Christian spouse and for the
Church if this "consecration" should lead to the free conversion of the
other spouse to the Christian faith.139 Sincere married love, the
humble and patient practice of the family virtues, and perseverance in
prayer can prepare the non-believing spouse to accept the grace of
conversion.

IV. The Effects of the Sacrament of Matrimony
1638 "From a valid marriage arises a bond between the spouses which
by its very nature is perpetual and exclusive; furthermore, in a
Christian marriage the spouses are strengthened and, as it were,
consecrated for the duties and the dignity of their state by a special
sacrament."140
The marriage bond
1639 The consent by which the spouses mutually give and receive one
another is sealed by God himself.141 From their covenant arises "an
institution, confirmed by the divine law, . . . even in the eyes of
society."142 The covenant between the spouses is integrated into God's
covenant with man: "Authentic married love is caught up into divine
love."143
1640 Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in
such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated between
baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which results from
the free human act of the spouses and their consummation of the
marriage, is a reality, henceforth irrevocable, and gives rise to a
covenant guaranteed by God's fidelity. the Church does not have the
power to contravene this disposition of divine wisdom.144
The grace of the sacrament of Matrimony
1641 "By reason of their state in life and of their order, [Christian
spouses] have their own special gifts in the People of God."145 This
grace proper to the sacrament of Matrimony is intended to perfect the
couple's love and to strengthen their indissoluble unity. By this grace
they "help one another to attain holiness in their married life and in
welcoming and educating their children."146
1642 Christ is the source of this grace. "Just as of old God
encountered his people with a covenant of love and fidelity, so our
Savior, the spouse of the Church, now encounters Christian spouses
through the sacrament of Matrimony."147 Christ dwells with them,
gives them the strength to take up their crosses and so follow him, to
rise again after they have fallen, to forgive one another, to bear one
another's burdens, to "be subject to one another out of reverence for
Christ,"148 and to love one another with supernatural, tender, and
fruitful love. In the joys of their love and family life he gives them here
on earth a foretaste of the wedding feast of the Lamb:
How can I ever express the happiness of a marriage joined by the
Church, strengthened by an offering, sealed by a blessing, announced
by angels, and ratified by the Father? . . . How wonderful the bond
between two believers, now one in hope, one in desire, one in
discipline, one in the same service! They are both children of one
Father and servants of the same Master, undivided in spirit and flesh,
truly two in one flesh. Where the flesh is one, one also is the spirit.149

V. The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love
1643 "Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the
person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power of feeling and
affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at a deeply
personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to
forming one heart and soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness
in definitive mutual giving; and it is open to fertility. In a word it is a
question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but
with a new significance which not only purifies and strengthens them,
but raises them to the extent of making them the expression of
specifically Christian values."150
The unity and indissolubility of marriage
1644 The love of the spouses requires, of its very nature, the unity and
indissolubility of the spouses' community of persons, which embraces
their entire life: "so they are no longer two, but one flesh."151 They
"are called to grow continually in their communion through day-to-day
fidelity to their marriage promise of total mutual self-giving."152 This
human communion is confirmed, purified, and completed by
communion in Jesus Christ, given through the sacrament of
Matrimony. It is deepened by lives of the common faith and by the
Eucharist received together.
1645 "The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is
made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to
man and wife in mutual and unreserved affection."153 Polygamy is
contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.154
The fidelity of conjugal love
1646 By its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of
the spouses. This is the consequence of the gift of themselves which
they make to each other. Love seeks to be definitive; it cannot be an
arrangement "until further notice." the "intimate union of marriage, as
a mutual giving of two persons, and the good of the children, demand
total fidelity from the spouses and require an unbreakable union
between them."155
1647 The deepest reason is found in the fidelity of God to his
covenant, in that of Christ to his Church. Through the sacrament of
Matrimony the spouses are enabled to represent this fidelity and
witness to it. Through the sacrament, the indissolubility of marriage
receives a new and deeper meaning.
1648 It can seem difficult, even impossible, to bind oneself for life to
another human being. This makes it all the more important to
proclaim the Good News that God loves us with a definitive and
irrevocable love, that married couples share in this love, that it
supports and sustains them, and that by their own faithfulness they can
be witnesses to God's faithful love. Spouses who with God's grace give
this witness, often in very difficult conditions, deserve the gratitude
and support of the ecclesial community.156
1649 Yet there are some situations in which living together becomes
practically impossible for a variety of reasons. In such cases the Church
permits the physical separation of the couple and their living apart. the
spouses do not cease to be husband and wife before God and so are
not free to contract a new union. In this difficult situation, the best
solution would be, if possible, reconciliation. the Christian community
is called to help these persons live out their situation in a Christian
manner and in fidelity to their marriage bond which remains
indissoluble.157
1650 Today there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have
recourse to civil divorce and contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the
words of Jesus Christ - "Whoever divorces his wife and marries
another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband
and marries another, she commits adultery"158 The Church maintains
that a new union cannot be recognized as valid, if the first marriage
was. If the divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a
situation that objectively contravenes God's law. Consequently, they
cannot receive Eucharistic communion as long as this situation
persists. For the same reason, they cannot exercise certain ecclesial
responsibilities. Reconciliation through the sacrament of Penance can
be granted only to those who have repented for having violated the sign
of the covenant and of fidelity to Christ, and who are committed to
living in complete continence.
1651 Toward Christians who live in this situation, and who often keep
the faith and desire to bring up their children in a Christian manner,
priests and the whole community must manifest an attentive solicitude,
so that they do not consider themselves separated from the Church, in
whose life they can and must participate as baptized persons:
They should be encouraged to listen to the Word of God, to attend the
Sacrifice of the Mass, to persevere in prayer, to contribute to works of
charity and to community efforts for justice, to bring up their children
in the Christian faith, to cultivate the spirit and practice of penance
and thus implore, day by day, God's grace.159
The openness to fertility
1652 "By its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is
ordered to the procreation and education of the offspring and it is in
them that it finds its crowning glory."160
Children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the
good of the parents themselves. God himself said: "It is not good that
man should be alone," and "from the beginning (he) made them male
and female"; wishing to associate them in a special way in his own
creative work, God blessed man and woman with the words: "Be
fruitful and multiply." Hence, true married love and the whole
structure of family life which results from it, without diminishment of
the other ends of marriage, are directed to disposing the spouses to
cooperate valiantly with the love of the Creator and Savior, who
through them will increase and enrich his family from day to day.161
1653 The fruitfulness of conjugal love extends to the fruits of the
moral, spiritual, and supernatural life that parents hand on to their
children by education. Parents are the principal and first educators of
their children.162 In this sense the fundamental task of marriage and
family is to be at the service of life.163
1654 Spouses to whom God has not granted children can nevertheless
have a conjugal life full of meaning, in both human and Christian
terms. Their marriage can radiate a fruitfulness of charity, of
hospitality, and of sacrifice.

VI. The Domestic Church
1655 Christ chose to be born and grow up in the bosom of the holy
family of Joseph and Mary. the Church is nothing other than "the
family of God." From the beginning, the core of the Church was often
constituted by those who had become believers "together with all
[their] household."164 When they were converted, they desired that
"their whole household" should also be saved.165 These families who
became believers were islands of Christian life in an unbelieving world.
1656 In our own time, in a world often alien and even hostile to faith,
believing families are of primary importance as centers of living,
radiant faith. For this reason the Second Vatican Council, using an
ancient expression, calls the family the Ecclesia domestica.166 It is in
the bosom of the family that parents are "by word and example . . . the
first heralds of the faith with regard to their children. They should
encourage them in the vocation which is proper to each child, fostering
with special care any religious vocation."167
1657 It is here that the father of the family, the mother, children, and
all members of the family exercise the priesthood of the baptized in a
privileged way "by the reception of the sacraments, prayer and
thanksgiving, the witness of a holy life, and self-denial and active
charity."168 Thus the home is the first school of Christian life and "a
school for human enrichment."169 Here one learns endurance and the
joy of work, fraternal love, generous - even repeated - forgiveness, and
above all divine worship in prayer and the offering of one's life.
1658 We must also remember the great number of single persons who,
because of the particular circumstances in which they have to live -
often not of their choosing - are especially close to Jesus' heart and
therefore deserve the special affection and active solicitude of the
Church, especially of pastors. Many remain without a human family
often due to conditions of poverty. Some live their situation in the
spirit of the Beatitudes, serving God and neighbor in exemplary
fashion. the doors of homes, the "domestic churches," and of the great
family which is the Church must be open to all of them. "No one is
without a family in this world: the Church is a home and family for
everyone, especially those who 'labor and are heavy laden.'"170

IN BRIEF
1659 St. Paul said: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the
Church.... This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ
and the Church" (Eph 5:25, 32).
1660 The marriage covenant, by which a man and a woman form with
each other an intimate communion of life and love, has been founded
and endowed with its own special laws by the Creator. By its very
nature it is ordered to the good of the couple, as well as to the
generation and education of children. Christ the Lord raised marriage
between the baptized to the dignity of a sacrament (cf CIC, can. 1055
# 1; cf. GS 48 # 1).
1661 The sacrament of Matrimony signifies the union of Christ and
the Church. It gives spouses the grace to love each other with the love
with which Christ has loved his Church; the grace of the sacrament
thus perfects the human love of the spouses, strengthens their
indissoluble unity, and sanctifies them on the way to eternal life (cf
Council of Trent: DS 1799).
1662 Marriage is based on the consent of the contracting parties, that
is, on their will to give themselves, each to the other, mutually and
definitively, in order to live a covenant of faithful and fruitful love.
1663 Since marriage establishes the couple in a public state of life in
the Church, it is fitting that its celebration be public, in the framework
of a liturgical celebration, before the priest (or a witness authorized by
the Church), the witnesses, and the assembly of the faithful.
1664 Unity, indissolubility, and openness to fertility are essential to
marriage. Polygamy is incompatible with the unity of marriage; divorce
separates what God has joined together; the refusal of fertility turns
married life away from its "supreme gift," the child (GS 50 # 1).
1665 The remarriage of persons divorced from a living, lawful spouse
contravenes the plan and law of God as taught by Christ. They are not
separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic
communion. They will lead Christian lives especially by educating their
children in the faith.
1666 The Christian home is the place where children receive the first
proclamation of the faith. For this reason the family home is rightly
called "the domestic church," a community of grace and prayer, a
school of human virtues and of Christian charity.

CHAPTER FOUR OTHER LITURGICAL CELEBRATIONS
Article 1
SACRAMENTALS
1667 "Holy Mother Church has, moreover, instituted sacramentals.
These are sacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacraments.
They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are
obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them men are
disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various
occasions in life are rendered holy."171
The characteristics of sacramentals
1668 Sacramentals are instituted for the sanctification of certain
ministries of the Church, certain states of life, a great variety of
circumstances in Christian life, and the use of many things helpful to
man. In accordance with bishops' pastoral decisions, they can also
respond to the needs, culture, and special history of the Christian
people of a particular region or time. They always include a prayer,
often accompanied by a specific sign, such as the laying on of hands,
the sign of the cross, or the sprinkling of holy water (which recalls
Baptism).
1669 Sacramentals derive from the baptismal priesthood: every
baptized person is called to be a "blessing," and to bless.172 Hence lay
people may preside at certain blessings; the more a blessing concerns
ecclesial and sacramental life, the more is its administration reserved to
the ordained ministry (bishops, priests, or deacons).173
1670 Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the
way that the sacraments do, but by the Church's prayer, they prepare
us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it. "For well-
disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and
sacramentals sanctifies almost every event of their lives with the divine
grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the Passion, Death, and
Resurrection of Christ. From this source all sacraments and
sacramentals draw their power. There is scarcely any proper use of
material things which cannot be thus directed toward the sanctification
of men and the praise of God."174
Various forms of sacramentals
1671 Among sacramentals blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and
places) come first. Every blessing praises God and prays for his gifts. In
Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father "with every spiritual
blessing."175 This is why the Church imparts blessings by invoking the
name of Jesus, usually while making the holy sign of the cross of
Christ.
1672 Certain blessings have a lasting importance because they
consecrate persons to God, or reserve objects and places for liturgical
use. Among those blessings which are intended for persons - not to be
confused with sacramental ordination - are the blessing of the abbot or
abbess of a monastery, the consecration of virgins and widows, the rite
of religious profession and the blessing of certain ministries of the
Church (readers, acolytes, catechists, etc.). The dedication or blessing
of a church or an altar, the blessing of holy oils, vessels, and vestments,
bells, etc., can be mentioned as examples of blessings that concern
objects.
1673 When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name
of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power
of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called
exorcism. Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has
received the power and office of exorcizing.176 In a simple form,
exorcism is performed at the celebration of Baptism. the solemn
exorcism, called "a major exorcism," can be performed only by a priest
and with the permission of the bishop. the priest must proceed with
prudence, strictly observing the rules established by the Church.
Exorcism is directed at the expulsion of demons or to the liberation
from demonic possession through the spiritual authority which Jesus
entrusted to his Church. Illness, especially psychological illness, is a
very different matter; treating this is the concern of medical science.
Therefore, before an exorcism is performed, it is important to ascertain
that one is dealing with the presence of the Evil One, and not an
illness.177
Popular piety
1674 Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must
take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions among the
faithful. the religious sense of the Christian people has always found
expression in various forms of piety surrounding the Church's
sacramental life, such as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries,
pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross, religious dances, the
rosary, medals,178 etc.
1675 These expressions of piety extend the liturgical life of the
Church, but do not replace it. They "should be so drawn up that they
harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy,
are in some way derived from it and lead the people to it, since in fact
the liturgy by its very nature is far superior to any of them."179
1676 Pastoral discernment is needed to sustain and support popular
piety and, if necessary, to purify and correct the religious sense which
underlies these devotions so that the faithful may advance in
knowledge of the mystery of Christ.180 Their exercise is subject to the
care and judgment of the bishops and to the general norms of the
Church.
At its core the piety of the people is a storehouse of values that offers
answers of Christian wisdom to the great questions of life. the Catholic
wisdom of the people is capable of fashioning a vital synthesis.... It
creatively combines the divine and the human, Christ and Mary, spirit
and body, communion and institution, person and community, faith
and homeland, intelligence and emotion. This wisdom is a Christian
humanism that radically affirms the dignity of every person as a child
of God, establishes a basic fraternity, teaches people to encounter
nature and understand work, provides reasons for joy and humor even
in the midst of a very hard life. For the people this wisdom is also a
principle of discernment and an evangelical instinct through which
they spontaneously sense when the Gospel is served in the Church and
when it is emptied of its content and stifled by other interests.181

IN BRIEF
1677 Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the Church. They
prepare men to receive the fruit of the sacraments and sanctify
different circumstances of life.
1678 Among the sacramentals blessings occupy an important place.
They include both praise of God for his works and gifts, and the
Church's intercession for men that they may be able to use God's gifts
according to the spirit of the Gospel.
1679 In addition to the liturgy, Christian life is nourished by various
forms of popular piety, rooted in the different cultures. While carefully
clarifying them in the light of faith, the Church fosters the forms of
popular piety that express an evangelical instinct and a human wisdom
and that enrich Christian life.

I. The Christian's Last Passover
1681 The Christian meaning of death is revealed in the light of the
Paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of Christ in whom
resides our only hope. the Christian who dies in Christ Jesus is "away
from the body and at home with the Lord."183
1682 For the Christian the day of death inaugurates, at the end of his
sacramental life, the fulfillment of his new birth begun at Baptism, the
definitive "conformity" to "the image of the Son" conferred by the
anointing of the Holy Spirit, and participation in the feast of the
Kingdom which was anticipated in the Eucharist - even if final
purifications are still necessary for him in order to be clothed with the
nuptial garment.
1683 The Church who, as Mother, has borne the Christian
sacramentally in her womb during his earthly pilgrimage, accompanies
him at his journey's end, in order to surrender him "into the Father's
hands." She offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of his grace, and
she commits to the earth, in hope, the seed of the body that will rise in
glory.184 This offering is fully celebrated in the Eucharistic sacrifice;
the blessings before and after Mass are sacramentals.

II. The Celebration of Funerals
1684 The Christian funeral is a liturgical celebration of the Church.
The ministry of the Church in this instance aims at expressing
efficacious communion with the deceased, at the participation in that
communion of the community gathered for the funeral, and at the
proclamation of eternal life to the community.
1685 The different funeral rites express the Paschal character of
Christian death and are in keeping with the situations and traditions of
each region, even as to the color of the liturgical vestments worn.186
1686 The Order of Christian Funerals (Ordo exsequiarum) of the
Roman liturgy gives three types of funeral celebrations, corresponding
to the three places in which they are conducted (the home, the church,
and the cemetery), and according to the importance attached to them
by the family, local customs, the culture, and popular piety. This order
of celebration is common to all the liturgical traditions and comprises
four principal elements:
1687 The greeting of the community. A greeting of faith begins the
celebration. Relatives and friends of the deceased are welcomed with a
word of "consolation" (in the New Testament sense of the Holy Spirit's
power in hope).187 The community of prayer assembling in prayer
also awaits the "words of eternal life." The death of a member of the
community (or the anniversary of a death, or the seventh or thirtieth
day after death) is an event that should lead beyond the perspectives of
"this world" and should draw the faithful into the true perspective of
faith in the risen Christ.
1688 The liturgy of the Word during funerals demands very careful
preparation because the assembly present for the funeral may include
some faithful who rarely attend the liturgy, and friends of the deceased
who are not Christians. the homily in particular must "avoid the
literary genre of funeral eulogy"188 and illumine the mystery of
Christian death in the light of the risen Christ.
1689 The Eucharistic Sacrifice. When the celebration takes place in
church the Eucharist is the heart of the Paschal reality of Christian
death.189 In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her efficacious
communion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit
the sacrifice of the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify
his child of his sins and their consequences, and to admit him to the
Paschal fullness of the table of the Kingdom.190 It is by the Eucharist
thus celebrated that the community of the faithful, especially the family
of the deceased, learn to live in communion with the one who "has
fallen asleep in the Lord," by communicating in the Body of Christ of
which he is a living member and, then, by praying for him and with
him.
1690 A farewell to the deceased is his final "commendation to God" by
the Church. It is "the last farewell by which the Christian community
greets one of its members before his body is brought to its tomb."191
The Byzantine tradition expresses this by the kiss of farewell to the
deceased:
By this final greeting "we sing for his departure from this life and
separation from us, but also because there is a communion and a
reunion. For even dead, we are not at all separated from one another,
because we all run the same course and we will find one another again
in the same place. We shall never be separated, for we live for Christ,
and now we are united with Christ as we go toward him . . . we shall all
be together in Christ."192

PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST
1691 "Christian, recognize your dignity and, now that you share in
God's own nature, do not return to your former base condition by
sinning. Remember who is your head and of whose body you are a
member. Never forget that you have been rescued from the power of
darkness and brought into the light of the Kingdom of God."1
1692 The Symbol of the faith confesses the greatness of God's gifts to
man in his work of creation, and even more in redemption and
sanctification. What faith confesses, the sacraments communicate: by
the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become "children of God,"2
"partakers of the divine nature."3 Coming to see in the faith their new
dignity, Christians are called to lead henceforth a life "worthy of the
gospel of Christ."4 They are made capable of doing so by the grace of
Christ and the gifts of his Spirit, which they receive through the
sacraments and through prayer.
1693 Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father,5 and
always lived in perfect communion with him. Likewise Christ's
disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father "who sees in
secret,"6 in order to become "perfect as your heavenly Father is
perfect."7
1694 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, Christians are "dead to sin
and alive to God in Christ Jesus" and so participate in the life of the
Risen Lord.8 Following Christ and united with him,9 Christians can
strive to be "imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love"10
by conforming their thoughts, words and actions to the "mind . . .
which is yours in Christ Jesus,"11 and by following his example.12
1695 "Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit
of our God,"13 "sanctified . . . (and) called to be saints,"14 Christians
have become the temple of the Holy Spirit.15 This "Spirit of the Son"
teaches them to pray to the Father16 and, having become their life,
prompts them to act so as to bear "the fruit of the Spirit"17 by charity
in action. Healing the wounds of sin, the Holy Spirit renews us
interiorly through a spiritual transformation.18 He enlightens and
strengthens us to live as "children of light" through "all that is good
and right and true."19
1696 The way of Christ "leads to life"; a contrary way "leads to
destruction."20 The Gospel parable of the two ways remains ever
present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of
moral decisions for our salvation: "There are two ways, the one of life,
the other of death; but between the two, there is a great difference."21
1697 Catechesis has to reveal in all clarity the joy and the demands of
the way of Christ.22 Catechesis for the "newness of life"23 in him
should be:
-a catechesis of the Holy Spirit, the interior Master of life according to
Christ, a gentle guest and friend who inspires, guides, corrects, and
strengthens this life;
-a catechesis of grace, for it is by grace that we are saved and again it is
by grace that our works can bear fruit for eternal life;
-a catechesis of the beatitudes, for the way of Christ is summed up in
the beatitudes, the only path that leads to the eternal beatitude for
which the human heart longs;
-a catechesis of sin and forgiveness, for unless man acknowledges that
he is a sinner he cannot know the truth about himself, which is a
condition for acting justly; and without the offer of forgiveness he
would not be able to bear this truth;
-a catechesis of the human virtues which causes one to grasp the
beauty and attraction of right dispositions towards goodness;
-a catechesis of the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity,
generously inspired by the example of the saints; -a catechesis of the
twofold commandment of charity set forth in the Decalogue;
-an ecclesial catechesis, for it is through the manifold exchanges of
"spiritual goods" in the "communion of saints" that Christian life can
grow, develop, and be communicated.
1698 The first and last point of reference of this catechesis will always
be Jesus Christ himself, who is "the way, and the truth, and the life."24
It is by looking to him in faith that Christ's faithful can hope that he
himself fulfills his promises in them, and that, by loving him with the
same love with which he has loved them, they may perform works in
keeping with their dignity:
I ask you to consider that our Lord Jesus Christ is your true head, and
that you are one of his members. He belongs to you as the head
belongs to its members; all that is his is yours: his spirit, his heart, his
body and soul, and all his faculties. You must make use of all these as
of your own, to serve, praise, love, and glorify God. You belong to him,
as members belong to their head. and so he longs for you to use all that
is in you, as if it were his own, for the service and glory of the
Father.25


For to me, to live is Christ.26

1700 The dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation in the
image and likeness of God (article 1); it is fulfilled in his vocation to
divine beatitude (article 2). It is essential to a human being freely to
direct himself to this fulfillment (article 3). By his deliberate actions
(article 4), the human person does, or does not, conform to the good
promised by God and attested by moral conscience (article 5). Human
beings make their own contribution to their interior growth; they make
their whole sentient and spiritual lives into means of this growth
(article 6). With the help of grace they grow in virtue (article 7), avoid
sin, and if they sin they entrust themselves as did the prodigal son1 to
the mercy of our Father in heaven (article 8). In this way they attain to
the perfection of charity.

Article 1 MAN: THE IMAGE OF GOD
1701 "Christ, . . . in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father
and of his love, makes man fully manifest to himself and brings to light
his exalted vocation."2 It is in Christ, "the image of the invisible
God,"3 that man has been created "in the image and likeness" of the
Creator. It is in Christ, Redeemer and Savior, that the divine image,
disfigured in man by the first sin, has been restored to its original
beauty and ennobled by the grace of God.4
1702 The divine image is present in every man. It shines forth in the
communion of persons, in the likeness of the unity of the divine
persons among themselves (cf chapter two).
1703 Endowed with "a spiritual and immortal" soul,5 The human
person is "the only creature on earth that God has willed for its own
sake."6 From his conception, he is destined for eternal beatitude.
1704 The human person participates in the light and power of the
divine Spirit. By his reason, he is capable of understanding the order of
things established by the Creator. By free will, he is capable of
directing himself toward his true good. He finds his perfection "in
seeking and loving what is true and good."7
1705 By virtue of his soul and his spiritual powers of intellect and will,
man is endowed with freedom, an "outstanding manifestation of the
divine image."8
1706 By his reason, man recognizes the voice of God which urges him
"to do what is good and avoid what is evil."9 Everyone is obliged to
follow this law, which makes itself heard in conscience and is fulfilled
in the love of God and of neighbor. Living a moral life bears witness to
the dignity of the person.
1707 "Man, enticed by the Evil One, abused his freedom at the very
beginning of history."10 He succumbed to temptation and did what
was evil. He still desires the good, but his nature bears the wound of
original sin. He is now inclined to evil and subject to error:
Man is divided in himself. As a result, the whole life of men, both
individual and social, shows itself to be a struggle, and a dramatic one,
between good and evil, between light and darkness.11
1708 By his Passion, Christ delivered us from Satan and from sin. He
merited for us the new life in the Holy Spirit. His grace restores what
sin had damaged in us.
1709 He who believes in Christ becomes a son of God. This filial
adoption transforms him by giving him the ability to follow the
example of Christ. It makes him capable of acting rightly and doing
good. In union with his Savior, the disciple attains the perfection of
charity which is holiness. Having matured in grace, the moral life
blossoms into eternal life in the glory of heaven.

Article 2 OUR VOCATION TO BEATITUDE
I. The Beatitudes
1716 The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up
the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. the Beatitudes
fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the
possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
shall be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all
kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.12
1717 The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and
portray his charity. They express the vocation of the faithful associated
with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed light on the
actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the
paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations;
they proclaim the blessings and rewards already secured, however
dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin
Mary and all the saints.

II. The Desire for Happiness
1718 The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness. This
desire is of divine origin: God has placed it in the human heart in order
to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it:
We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there is no one
who does not assent to this proposition, even before it is fully
articulated.13


How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you, my God, I
seek a happy life, let me seek you so that my soul may live, for my body
draws life from my soul and my soul draws life from you.14
God alone satisfies.15
1719 The Beatitudes reveal the goal of human existence, the ultimate
end of human acts: God calls us to his own beatitude. This vocation is
addressed to each individual personally, but also to the Church as a
whole, the new people made up of those who have accepted the
promise and live from it in faith.

III. Christian Beatitude
1720 The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the
beatitude to which God calls man:
- the coming of the Kingdom of God;16
- the vision of God: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God"17
- entering into the joy of the Lord;18
- entering into God's rest:19
There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall love and
praise. Behold what will be at the end without end. For what other end
do we have, if not to reach the kingdom which has no end?20
1721 God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him, and
so to come to paradise. Beatitude makes us "partakers of the divine
nature" and of eternal life.21 With beatitude, man enters into the glory
of Christ22 and into the joy of the Trinitarian life.
1722 Such beatitude surpasses the understanding and powers of man.
It comes from an entirely free gift of God: whence it is called
supernatural, as is the grace that disposes man to enter into the divine
joy.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
It is true, because of the greatness and inexpressible glory of God, that
"man shall not see me and live," for the Father cannot be grasped. But
because of God's love and goodness toward us, and because he can do
all things, he goes so far as to grant those who love him the privilege of
seeing him.... For "what is impossible for men is possible for God."23
1723 The beatitude we are promised confronts us with decisive moral
choices. It invites us to purify our hearts of bad instincts and to seek
the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true happiness is not
found in riches or well-being, in human fame or power, or in any
human achievement - however beneficial it may be - such as science,
technology, and art, or indeed in any creature, but in God alone, the
source of every good and of all love:
All bow down before wealth. Wealth is that to which the multitude of
men pay an instinctive homage. They measure happiness by wealth;
and by wealth they measure respectability.... It is a homage resulting
from a profound faith ... that with wealth he may do all things. Wealth
is one idol of the day and notoriety is a second.... Notoriety, or the
making of a noise in the world - it may be called "newspaper fame" -
has come to be considered a great good in itself, and a ground of
veneration.24
1724 The Decalogue, the Sermon on the Mount, and the apostolic
catechesis describe for us the paths that lead to the Kingdom of
heaven. Sustained by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we tread them, step
by step, by everyday acts. By the working of the Word of Christ, we
slowly bear fruit in the Church to the glory of God.25

1725 The Beatitudes take up and fulfill God's promises from Abraham
on by ordering them to the Kingdom of heaven. They respond to the
desire for happiness that God has placed in the human heart.
1726 The Beatitudes teach us the final end to which God calls us: the
Kingdom, the vision of God, participation in the divine nature, eternal
life, filiation, rest in God.
1727 The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God. It is
supernatural, as is the grace that leads us there.
1728 The Beatitudes confront us with decisive choices concerning
earthly goods; they purify our hearts in order to teach us to love God
above all things.
1729 The beatitude of heaven sets the standards for discernment in the
use of earthly goods in keeping with the law of God.

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM
1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity
of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed
that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he
might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and
blessed perfection by cleaving to him."26
Man is rational and therefore like God; he is created with free will and
is master over his acts.27

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM




I. Freedom and Responsibility
1731 Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will, to act or not to
act, to do this or that, and so to perform deliberate actions on one's
own responsibility. By free will one shapes one's own life. Human
freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and goodness; it
attains its perfection when directed toward God, our beatitude.
1732 As long as freedom has not bound itself definitively to its
ultimate good which is God, there is the possibility of choosing
between good and evil, and thus of growing in perfection or of failing
and sinning. This freedom characterizes properly human acts. It is the
basis of praise or blame, merit or reproach.
1733 The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes. There is
no true freedom except in the service of what is good and just. the
choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and leads to "the
slavery of sin."28
1734 Freedom makes man responsible for his acts to the extent that
they are voluntary. Progress in virtue, knowledge of the good, and
ascesis enhance the mastery of the will over its acts.
1735 Imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished
or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit,
inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors.
1736 Every act directly willed is imputable to its author:
Thus the Lord asked Eve after the sin in the garden: "What is this that
you have done?"29 He asked Cain the same question.30 The prophet
Nathan questioned David in the same way after he committed adultery
with the wife of Uriah and had him murdered.31
An action can be indirectly voluntary when it results from negligence
regarding something one should have known or done: for example, an
accident arising from ignorance of traffic laws.
1737 An effect can be tolerated without being willed by its agent; for
instance, a mother's exhaustion from tending her sick child. A bad
effect is not imputable if it was not willed either as an end or as a
means of an action, e.g., a death a person incurs in aiding someone in
danger. For a bad effect to be imputable it must be foreseeable and the
agent must have the possibility of avoiding it, as in the case of
manslaughter caused by a drunken driver.
1738 Freedom is exercised in relationships between human beings.
Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural
right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each
other this duty of respect. the right to the exercise of freedom,
especially in moral and religious matters, is an inalienable requirement
of the dignity of the human person. This right must be recognized and
protected by civil authority within the limits of the common good and
public order.32

Article 3 MAN'S FREEDOM




II. Human Freedom in the Economy of Salvation
1739 Freedom and sin. Man's freedom is limited and fallible. In fact,
man failed. He freely sinned. By refusing God's plan of love, he
deceived himself and became a slave to sin. This first alienation
engendered a multitude of others. From its outset, human history
attests the wretchedness and oppression born of the human heart in
consequence of the abuse of freedom.
1740 Threats to freedom. the exercise of freedom does not imply a
right to say or do everything. It is false to maintain that man, "the
subject of this freedom," is "an individual who is fully self-sufficient
and whose finality is the satisfaction of his own interests in the
enjoyment of earthly goods."33 Moreover, the economic, social,
political, and cultural conditions that are needed for a just exercise of
freedom are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations of
blindness and injustice injure the moral life and involve the strong as
well as the weak in the temptation to sin against charity. By deviating
from the moral law man violates his own freedom, becomes
imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighborly fellowship, and rebels
against divine truth.
1741 Liberation and salvation. By his glorious Cross Christ has won
salvation for all men. He redeemed them from the sin that held them
in bondage. "For freedom Christ has set us free."34 In him we have
communion with the "truth that makes us free."35 The Holy Spirit has
been given to us and, as the Apostle teaches, "Where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is freedom."36 Already we glory in the "liberty of the
children of God."37
1742 Freedom and grace. the grace of Christ is not in the slightest way
a rival of our freedom when this freedom accords with the sense of the
true and the good that God has put in the human heart. On the
contrary, as Christian experience attests especially in prayer, the more
docile we are to the promptings of grace, the more we grow in inner
freedom and confidence during trials, such as those we face in the
pressures and constraints of the outer world. By the working of grace
the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us
free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world:
Almighty and merciful God,
in your goodness take away from us all that is harmful,
so that, made ready both in mind and body,
we may freely accomplish your will.38

IN BRIEF
1743 "God willed that man should be left in the hand of his own
counsel (cf Sir 15:14), so that he might of his own accord seek his
creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to
him" (GS 17 # 1).
1744 Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and so to perform
deliberate acts of one's own. Freedom attains perfection in its acts
when directed toward God, the sovereign Good.
1745 Freedom characterizes properly human acts. It makes the human
being responsible for acts of which he is the voluntary agent. His
deliberate acts properly belong to him.
1746 The imputability or responsibility for an action can be diminished
or nullified by ignorance, duress, fear, and other psychological or social
factors.
1747 The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in religious and
moral matters, is an inalienable requirement of the dignity of man. But
the exercise of freedom does not entail the putative right to say or do
anything.

Article 4 THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS
1749 Freedom makes man a moral subject. When he acts deliberately,
man is, so to speak, the father of his acts. Human acts, that is, acts that
are freely chosen in consequence of a judgment of conscience, can be
morally evaluated. They are either good or evil.

Article 4 THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS
I. The Sources of Morality
1750 The morality of human acts depends on:
- the object chosen;
- the end in view or the intention;
- the circumstances of the action.
The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the
"sources," or constitutive elements, of the morality of human acts.
1751 The object chosen is a good toward which the will deliberately
directs itself. It is the matter of a human act. the object chosen morally
specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes and judges it to
be or not to be in conformity with the true good. Objective norms of
morality express the rational order of good and evil, attested to by
conscience.
1752 In contrast to the object, the intention resides in the acting
subject. Because it lies at the voluntary source of an action and
determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the moral
evaluation of an action. the end is the first goal of the intention and
indicates the purpose pursued in the action. the intention is a
movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned with the goal of
the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from the action undertaken.
Intention is not limited to directing individual actions, but can guide
several actions toward one and the same purpose; it can orient one's
whole life toward its ultimate end. For example, a service done with
the end of helping one's neighbor can at the same time be inspired by
the love of God as the ultimate end of all our actions. One and the
same action can also be inspired by several intentions, such as
performing a service in order to obtain a favor or to boast about it.
1753 A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor)
does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying
and calumny, good or just. the end does not justify the means. Thus
the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a
legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added
bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of
itself, can be good (such as almsgiving).39
1754 The circumstances, including the consequences, are secondary
elements of a moral act. They contribute to increasing or diminishing
the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for example, the amount of
a theft). They can also diminish or increase the agent's responsibility
(such as acting out of a fear of death). Circumstances of themselves
cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make
neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil.

II. Good Acts and Evil Acts
1755 A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of the
end, and of the circumstances together. An evil end corrupts the
action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and fasting
"in order to be seen by men").
The object of the choice can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There
are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that it is always wrong to
choose, because choosing them entails a disorder of the will, that is, a
moral evil.
1756 It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by
considering only the intention that inspires them or the circumstances
(environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.) which supply
their context. There are acts which, in and of themselves,
independently of circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit
by reason of their object; such as blasphemy and perjury, murder and
adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it.

IN BRIEF
1757 The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the
three "sources" of the morality of human acts.
1758 The object chosen orally specifies the act of willing accordingly as
reason recognizes and judges it good or evil.
1759 "An evil action cannot be justified by reference to a good
intention" (cf St. Thomas Aquinas, Dec. praec. 6). the end does not
justify the means.
1760 A morally good act requires the goodness of its object, of its end,
and of its circumstances together.
1761 There are concrete acts that it is always wrong to choose, because
their choice entails a disorder of the will, i.e., a moral evil. One may
not do evil so that good may result from it.

I. Passions
1763 The term "passions" belongs to the Christian patrimony. Feelings
or passions are emotions or movements of the sensitive appetite that
incline us to act or not to act in regard to something felt or imagined to
be good or evil.
1764 The passions are natural components of the human psyche; they
form the passageway and ensure the connection between the life of the
senses and the life of the mind. Our Lord called man's heart the source
from which the passions spring.40
1765 There are many passions. the most fundamental passion is love,
aroused by the attraction of the good. Love causes a desire for the
absent good and the hope of obtaining it; this movement finds
completion in the pleasure and joy of the good possessed. the
apprehension of evil causes hatred, aversion, and fear of the impending
evil; this movement ends in sadness at some present evil, or in the
anger that resists it.
1766 "To love is to will the good of another."41 All other affections
have their source in this first movement of the human heart toward the
good. Only the good can be loved.42 Passions "are evil if love is evil
and good if it is good."43

II. Passions and Moral Life
1767 In themselves passions are neither good nor evil. They are
morally qualified only to the extent that they effectively engage reason
and will. Passions are said to be voluntary, "either because they are
commanded by the will or because the will does not place obstacles in
their way."44 It belongs to the perfection of the moral or human good
that the passions be governed by reason.45
1768 Strong feelings are not decisive for the morality or the holiness of
persons; they are simply the inexhaustible reservoir of images and
affections in which the moral life is expressed. Passions are morally
good when they contribute to a good action, evil in the opposite case.
the upright will orders the movements of the senses it appropriates to
the good and to beatitude; an evil will succumbs to disordered passions
and exacerbates them. Emotions and feelings can be taken up into the
virtues or perverted by the vices.
1769 In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit himself accomplishes his
work by mobilizing the whole being, with all its sorrows, fears and
sadness, as is visible in the Lord's agony and passion. In Christ human
feelings are able to reach their consummation in charity and divine
beatitude.
1770 Moral perfection consists in man's being moved to the good not
by his will alone, but also by his sensitive appetite, as in the words of
the psalm: "My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God."46

Article 5 THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS
IN BRIEF
1771 The term "passions" refers to the affections or the feelings. By his
emotions man intuits the good and suspects evil.
1772 The principal passions are love and hatred, desire and fear, joy,
sadness, and anger.
1773 In the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is
neither moral good nor evil. But insofar as they engage reason and will,
there is moral good or evil in them.
1774 Emotions and feelings can be taken up in the virtues or perverted
by the vices.
1775 The perfection of the moral good consists in man's being moved
to the good not only by his will but also by his "heart."

him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his
heart at the right moment.... For man has in his heart a law inscribed
by God.... His conscience is man's most secret core and his sanctuary.
There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."47

Article 6 MORAL CONSCIENCE




I. The Judgment of Conscience
1777 Moral conscience,48 present at the heart of the person, enjoins
him at the appropriate moment to do good and to avoid evil. It also
judges particular choices, approving those that are good and
denouncing those that are evil.49 It bears witness to the authority of
truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is
drawn, and it welcomes the commandments. When he listens to his
conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking.
1778 Conscience is a judgment of reason whereby the human person
recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act that he is going to
perform, is in the process of performing, or has already completed. In
all he says and does, man is obliged to follow faithfully what he knows
to be just and right. It is by the judgment of his conscience that man
perceives and recognizes the prescriptions of the divine law:
Conscience is a law of the mind; yet [Christians] would not grant that
it is nothing more; I mean that it was not a dictate, nor conveyed the
notion of responsibility, of duty, of a threat and a promise....
[Conscience] is a messenger of him, who, both in nature and in grace,
speaks to us behind a veil, and teaches and rules us by his
representatives. Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ.50
1779 It is important for every person to be sufficiently present to
himself in order to hear and follow the voice of his conscience. This
requirement of interiority is all the more necessary as life often
distracts us from any reflection, self-examination or introspection:
Return to your conscience, question it.... Turn inward, brethren, and in
everything you do, see God as your witness.51
1780 The dignity of the human person implies and requires
uprightness of moral conscience. Conscience includes the perception
of the principles of morality (synderesis); their application in the given
circumstances by practical discernment of reasons and goods; and
finally judgment about concrete acts yet to be performed or already
performed. the truth about the moral good, stated in the law of reason,
is recognized practically and concretely by the prudent judgment of
conscience. We call that man prudent who chooses in conformity with
this judgment.
1781 Conscience enables one to assume responsibility for the acts
performed. If man commits evil, the just judgment of conscience can
remain within him as the witness to the universal truth of the good, at
the same time as the evil of his particular choice. the verdict of the
judgment of conscience remains a pledge of hope and mercy. In
attesting to the fault committed, it calls to mind the forgiveness that
must be asked, the good that must still be practiced, and the virtue that
must be constantly cultivated with the grace of God:
We shall . . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts
condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows
everything.52
1782 Man has the right to act in conscience and in freedom so as
personally to make moral decisions. "He must not be forced to act
contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting
according to his conscience, especially in religious matters."53

II. The Formation of Conscience
1783 Conscience must be informed and moral judgment enlightened.
A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates its
judgments according to reason, in conformity with the true good
willed by the wisdom of the Creator. the education of conscience is
indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative
influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to
reject authoritative teachings.
1784 The education of the conscience is a lifelong task. From the
earliest years, it awakens the child to the knowledge and practice of the
interior law recognized by conscience. Prudent education teaches
virtue; it prevents or cures fear, selfishness and pride, resentment
arising from guilt, and feelings of complacency, born of human
weakness and faults. the education of the conscience guarantees
freedom and engenders peace of heart.
1785 In the formation of conscience the Word of God is the light for
our path,54 we must assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it into
practice. We must also examine our conscience before the Lord's Cross.
We are assisted by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided by the witness or
advice of others and guided by the authoritative teaching of the
Church.55

III. To Choose in Accord With Conscience
1786 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right
judgment in accordance with reason and the divine law or, on the
contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them.
1787 Man is sometimes confronted by situations that make moral
judgments less assured and decision difficult. But he must always
seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will of God
expressed in divine law.
1788 To this purpose, man strives to interpret the data of experience
and the signs of the times assisted by the virtue of prudence, by the
advice of competent people, and by the help of the Holy Spirit and his
gifts.
1789 Some rules apply in every case:
- One may never do evil so that good may result from it;
- the Golden Rule: "Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do
so to them."56
- charity always proceeds by way of respect for one's neighbor and his
conscience: "Thus sinning against your brethren and wounding their
conscience . . . you sin against Christ."57 Therefore "it is right not to . .
. do anything that makes your brother stumble."58

IV. Erroneous Judgment
1790 A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his
conscience. If he were deliberately to act against it, he would condemn
himself. Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance
and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already
committed.
1791 This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility.
This is the case when a man "takes little trouble to find out what is
true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded
through the habit of committing sin."59 In such cases, the person is
culpable for the evil he commits.
1792 Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others,
enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of
autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her
teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source
of errors of judgment in moral conduct.
1793 If - on the contrary - the ignorance is invincible, or the moral
subject is not responsible for his erroneous judgment, the evil
committed by the person cannot be imputed to him. It remains no less
an evil, a privation, a disorder. One must therefore work to correct the
errors of moral conscience.
1794 A good and pure conscience is enlightened by true faith, for
charity proceeds at the same time "from a pure heart and a good
conscience and sincere faith."60
The more a correct conscience prevails, the more do persons and
groups turn aside from blind choice and try to be guided by objective
standards of moral conduct.61

1796 Conscience is a judgment of reason by which the human person
recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act.
1797 For the man who has committed evil, the verdict of his
conscience remains a pledge of conversion and of hope.
1798 A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates
its judgments according to reason, in conformity with the true good
willed by the wisdom of the Creator. Everyone must avail himself of
the means to form his conscience.
1799 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right

conscience.
1801 Conscience can remain in ignorance or make erroneous
judgments. Such ignorance and errors are not always free of guilt.

faith and prayer and put it into practice. This is how moral conscience
is formed.

1803 "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any
excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these

A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. It allows
the person not only to perform good acts, but to give the best of
himself. the virtuous person tends toward the good with all his sensory
and spiritual powers; he pursues the good and chooses it in concrete
actions.
The goal of a virtuous life is to become like God.63

I. The Human Virtues
1804 Human virtues are firm attitudes, stable dispositions, habitual
perfections of intellect and will that govern our actions, order our
passions, and guide our conduct according to reason and faith. They
make possible ease, self-mastery, and joy in leading a morally good life.
the virtuous man is he who freely practices the good.
The moral virtues are acquired by human effort. They are the fruit and
seed of morally good acts; they dispose all the powers of the human
being for communion with divine love.
The cardinal virtues
1805 Four virtues play a pivotal role and accordingly are called
"cardinal"; all the others are grouped around them. They are:
prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. "If anyone loves
righteousness, [Wisdom's] labors are virtues; for she teaches
temperance and prudence, justice, and courage."64 These virtues are
praised under other names in many passages of Scripture.
1806 Prudence is the virtue that disposes practical reason to discern
our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of
achieving it; "the prudent man looks where he is going."65 "Keep sane
and sober for your prayers."66 Prudence is "right reason in action,"
writes St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle.67 It is not to be
confused with timidity or fear, nor with duplicity or dissimulation. It is
called auriga virtutum (the charioteer of the virtues); it guides the
other virtues by setting rule and measure. It is prudence that
immediately guides the judgment of conscience. the prudent man
determines and directs his conduct in accordance with this judgment.
With the help of this virtue we apply moral principles to particular
cases without error and overcome doubts about the good to achieve
and the evil to avoid.
1807 Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm
will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God is called
the "virtue of religion." Justice toward men disposes one to respect the
rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that
promotes equity with regard to persons and to the common good. the
just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by
habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his
neighbor. "You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but
in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor."68 "Masters, treat your
slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in
heaven."69
1808 Fortitude is the moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties
and constancy in the pursuit of the good. It strengthens the resolve to
resist temptations and to overcome obstacles in the moral life. the
virtue of fortitude enables one to conquer fear, even fear of death, and
to face trials and persecutions. It disposes one even to renounce and
sacrifice his life in defense of a just cause. "The Lord is my strength
and my song."70 "In the world you have tribulation; but be of good
cheer, I have overcome the world."71
1809 Temperance is the moral virtue that moderates the attraction of
pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods. It ensures
the will's mastery over instincts and keeps desires within the limits of
what is honorable. the temperate person directs the sensitive appetites
toward what is good and maintains a healthy discretion: "Do not follow
your inclination and strength, walking according to the desires of your
heart."72 Temperance is often praised in the Old Testament: "Do not
follow your base desires, but restrain your appetites."73 In the New
Testament it is called "moderation" or "sobriety." We ought "to live
sober, upright, and godly lives in this world."74
To live well is nothing other than to love God with all one's heart, with
all one's soul and with all one's efforts; from this it comes about that
love is kept whole and uncorrupted (through temperance). No
misfortune can disturb it (and this is fortitude). It obeys only (God)
(and this is justice), and is careful in discerning things, so as not to be
surprised by deceit or trickery (and this is prudence).75
The virtues and grace
1810 Human virtues acquired by education, by deliberate acts and by
a perseverance ever-renewed in repeated efforts are purified and
elevated by divine grace. With God's help, they forge character and give
facility in the practice of the good. the virtuous man is happy to
practice them.
1811 It is not easy for man, wounded by sin, to maintain moral
balance. Christ's gift of salvation offers us the grace necessary to
persevere in the pursuit of the virtues. Everyone should always ask for
this grace of light and strength, frequent the sacraments, cooperate
with the Holy Spirit, and follow his calls to love what is good and shun
evil.

II. The Theological Virtues
1812 The human virtues are rooted in the theological virtues, which
adapt man's faculties for participation in the divine nature:76 for the
theological virtues relate directly to God. They dispose Christians to
live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have the One and
Triune God for their origin, motive, and object.
1813 The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral
activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They inform
and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God into the
souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and
of meriting eternal life. They are the pledge of the presence and action
of the Holy Spirit in the faculties of the human being. There are three
theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity.77
Faith
1814 Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and
believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church
proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself. By faith "man freely
commits his entire self to God."78 For this reason the believer seeks to
know and do God's will. "The righteous shall live by faith." Living faith
"work(s) through charity."79
1815 The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it.80
But "faith apart from works is dead":81 when it is deprived of hope
and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not
make him a living member of his Body.
1816 The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith and live on it,
but also profess it, confidently bear witness to it, and spread it: "All
however must be prepared to confess Christ before men and to follow
him along the way of the Cross, amidst the persecutions which the
Church never lacks."82 Service of and witness to the faith are
necessary for salvation: "So every one who acknowledges me before
men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but
whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who
is in heaven."83
Hope
1817 Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of
heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's
promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the
grace of the Holy Spirit. "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope
without wavering, for he who promised is faithful."84 "The Holy Spirit
. . . he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so
that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of
eternal life."85
1818 The virtue of hope responds to the aspiration to happiness which
God has placed in the heart of every man; it takes up the hopes that
inspire men's activities and purifies them so as to order them to the
Kingdom of heaven; it keeps man from discouragement; it sustains him
during times of abandonment; it opens up his heart in expectation of
eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by hope, he is preserved from selfishness
and led to the happiness that flows from charity.
1819 Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen
people which has its origin and model in the hope of Abraham, who
was blessed abundantly by the promises of God fulfilled in Isaac, and
who was purified by the test of the sacrifice.86 "Hoping against hope,
he believed, and thus became the father of many nations."87
1820 Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus' preaching in
the proclamation of the beatitudes. the beatitudes raise our hope
toward heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the path that
leads through the trials that await the disciples of Jesus. But through
the merits of Jesus Christ and of his Passion, God keeps us in the
"hope that does not disappoint."88 Hope is the "sure and steadfast
anchor of the soul . . . that enters . . . where Jesus has gone as a
forerunner on our behalf."89 Hope is also a weapon that protects us in
the struggle of salvation: "Let us . . . put on the breastplate of faith and
charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation."90 It affords us joy
even under trial: "Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation."91
Hope is expressed and nourished in prayer, especially in the Our
Father, the summary of everything that hope leads us to desire.
1821 We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to
those who love him and do his will.92 In every circumstance, each one
of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere "to the end"93
and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God's eternal reward for the good
works accomplished with the grace of Christ. In hope, the Church
prays for "all men to be saved."94 She longs to be united with Christ,
her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven:
Hope, O my soul, hope. You know neither the day nor the hour. Watch
carefully, for everything passes quickly, even though your impatience
makes doubtful what is certain, and turns a very short time into a long
one. Dream that the more you struggle, the more you prove the love
that you bear your God, and the more you will rejoice one day with
your Beloved, in a happiness and rapture that can never end.95
Charity
1822 Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all
things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of
God.
1823 Jesus makes charity the new commandment.96 By loving his own
"to the end,"97 he makes manifest the Father's love which he receives.
By loving one another, the disciples imitate the love of Jesus which they
themselves receive. Whence Jesus says: "As the Father has loved me, so
have I loved you; abide in my love." and again: "This is my
commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."98
1824 Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps the
commandments of God and his Christ: "Abide in my love. If you keep
my commandments, you will abide in my love."99
1825 Christ died out of love for us, while we were still "enemies."100
The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to make
ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love children and
the poor as Christ himself.101
The Apostle Paul has given an incomparable depiction of charity:
"charity is patient and kind, charity is not jealous or boastful; it is not
arrogant or rude. Charity does not insist on its own way; it is not
irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the
right. Charity bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things."102
1826 "If I . . . have not charity," says the Apostle, "I am nothing."
Whatever my privilege, service, or even virtue, "if I . . . have not charity,
I gain nothing."103 Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is the first
of the theological virtues: "So faith, hope, charity abide, these three.
But the greatest of these is charity."104
1827 The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by charity,
which "binds everything together in perfect harmony";105 it is the
form of the virtues; it articulates and orders them among themselves; it
is the source and the goal of their Christian practice. Charity upholds
and purifies our human ability to love, and raises it to the supernatural
perfection of divine love.
1828 The practice of the moral life animated by charity gives to the
Christian the spiritual freedom of the children of God. He no longer
stands before God as a slave, in servile fear, or as a mercenary looking
for wages, but as a son responding to the love of him who "first loved
us":106
If we turn away from evil out of fear of punishment, we are in the
position of slaves. If we pursue the enticement of wages, . . . we
resemble mercenaries. Finally if we obey for the sake of the good itself
and out of love for him who commands . . . we are in the position of
children.107
1829 The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy; charity demands
beneficence and fraternal correction; it is benevolence; it fosters
reciprocity and remains disinterested and generous; it is friendship and
communion:
Love is itself the fulfillment of all our works. There is the goal; that is
why we run: we run toward it, and once we reach it, in it we shall find
rest.108

III. The Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit
1830 The moral life of Christians is sustained by the gifts of the Holy
Spirit. These are permanent dispositions which make man docile in
following the promptings of the Holy Spirit.
1831 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding,
counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. They belong
in their fullness to Christ, Son of David.109 They complete and perfect
the virtues of those who receive them. They make the faithful docile in
readily obeying divine inspirations.
Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.110
For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God . . . If
children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.111
1832 The fruits of the Spirit are perfections that the Holy Spirit forms
in us as the first fruits of eternal glory. the tradition of the Church lists
twelve of them: "charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, self-control, chastity."112

IN BRIEF
1833 Virtue is a habitual and firm disposition to do good.
1834 The human virtues are stable dispositions of the intellect and the
will that govern our acts, order our passions, and guide our conduct in
accordance with reason and faith. They can be grouped around the
four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.
1835 Prudence disposes the practical reason to discern, in every
circumstance, our true good and to choose the right means for
achieving it.
1836 Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give God and
neighbor their due.
1837 Fortitude ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the
pursuit of the good.
1838 Temperance moderates the attraction of the pleasures of the
senses and provides balance in the use of created goods.
1839 The moral virtues grow through education, deliberate acts, and
perseverance in struggle. Divine grace purifies and elevates them.
1840 The theological virtues dispose Christians to live in a relationship
with the Holy Trinity. They have God for their origin, their motive, and
their object - God known by faith, God hoped in and loved for his own
sake.
1841 There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. They
inform all the moral virtues and give life to them.
1842 By faith, we believe in God and believe all that he has revealed to
us and that Holy Church proposes for our belief.
1843 By hope we desire, and with steadfast trust await from God,
eternal life and the graces to merit it.
1844 By charity, we love God above all things and our neighbor as
ourselves for love of God. Charity, the form of all the virtues, "binds
everything together in perfect harmony" (Col 3:14).
1845 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon Christians are
wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear
of the Lord.

Article 8 SIN
I. Mercy and Sin
1846 The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God's mercy to
sinners.113 The angel announced to Joseph: "You shall call his name
Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."114 The same is true
of the Eucharist, the sacrament of redemption: "This is my blood of
the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of
sins."115
1847 "God created us without us: but he did not will to save us
without us."116 To receive his mercy, we must admit our faults. "If we
say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness."117
1848 As St. Paul affirms, "Where sin increased, grace abounded all the
more."118 But to do its work grace must uncover sin so as to convert
our hearts and bestow on us "righteousness to eternal life through
Jesus Christ ourLord."119 Like a physician who probes the wound
before treating it, God, by his Word and by his Spirit, casts a living
light on sin:
Conversion requires convincing of sin; it includes the interior
judgment of conscience, and this, being a proof of the action of the
Spirit of truth in man's inmost being, becomes at the same time the
start of a new grant of grace and love: "Receive the Holy Spirit." Thus
in this "convincing concerning sin" we discover a double gift: the gift of
the truth of conscience and the gift of the certainty of redemption. the
Spirit of truth is the Consoler.120

II. The Definition of Sin
1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is
failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse
attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures
human solidarity. It has been defined as "an utterance, a deed, or a
desire contrary to the eternal law."121
1850 Sin is an offense against God: "Against you, you alone, have I
sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight."122 Sin sets itself
against God's love for us and turns our hearts away from it. Like the
first sin, it is disobedience, a revolt against God through the will to
become "like gods,"123 knowing and determining good and evil. Sin is
thus "love of oneself even to contempt of God."124 In this proud self-
exaltation, sin is diametrically opposed to the obedience of Jesus,
which achieves our salvation.125
1851 It is precisely in the Passion, when the mercy of Christ is about
to vanquish it, that sin most clearly manifests its violence and its many
forms: unbelief, murderous hatred, shunning and mockery by the
leaders and the people, Pilate's cowardice and the cruelty of the
soldiers, Judas' betrayal - so bitter to Jesus, Peter's denial and the
disciples' flight. However, at the very hour of darkness, the hour of the
prince of this world,126 The sacrifice of Christ secretly becomes the
source from which the forgiveness of our sins will pour forth
inexhaustibly.

III. The Different Kinds of Sins
1852 There are a great many kinds of sins. Scripture provides several
lists of them. the Letter to the Galatians contrasts the works of the
flesh with the fruit of the Spirit: "Now the works of the flesh are plain:
fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife,
jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, factions, envy, drunkenness,
carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those
who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God."127
1853 Sins can be distinguished according to their objects, as can every
human act; or according to the virtues they oppose, by excess or
defect; or according to the commandments they violate. They can also
be classed according to whether they concern God, neighbor, or
oneself; they can be divided into spiritual and carnal sins, or again as
sins in thought, word, deed, or omission. the root of sin is in the heart
of man, in his free will, according to the teaching of the Lord: "For out
of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft,
false witness, slander. These are what defile a man."128 But in the
heart also resides charity, the source of the good and pure works,
which sin wounds.

IV. The Gravity of Sin: Mortal and Venial Sin
1854 Sins are rightly evaluated according to their gravity. the
distinction between mortal and venial sin, already evident in
Scripture,129 became part of the tradition of the Church. It is
corroborated by human experience.
1855 Mortal sin destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave
violation of God's law; it turns man away from God, who is his
ultimate end and his beatitude, by preferring an inferior good to him.
Venial sin allows charity to subsist, even though it offends and wounds
it.
1856 Mortal sin, by attacking the vital principle within us - that is,
charity - necessitates a new initiative of God's mercy and a conversion
of heart which is normally accomplished within the setting of the
sacrament of reconciliation:
When the will sets itself upon something that is of its nature
incompatible with the charity that orients man toward his ultimate
end, then the sin is mortal by its very object . . . whether it contradicts
the love of God, such as blasphemy or perjury, or the love of neighbor,
such as homicide or adultery.... But when the sinner's will is set upon
something that of its nature involves a disorder, but is not opposed to
the love of God and neighbor, such as thoughtless chatter or
immoderate laughter and the like, such sins are venial.130
1857 For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be met:
"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also
committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent."131
1858 Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments,
corresponding to the answer of Jesus to the rich young man: "Do not
kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness,
Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother."132 The gravity
of sins is more or less great: murder is graver than theft. One must also
take into account who is wronged: violence against parents is in itself
graver than violence against a stranger.
1859 Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It
presupposes knowledge of the sinful character of the act, of its
opposition to God's law. It also implies a consent sufficiently deliberate
to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness of heart133
do not diminish, but rather increase, the voluntary character of a sin.
1860 Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the
imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant of
the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of
every man. the promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish
the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external
pressures or pathological disorders. Sin committed through malice, by
deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest.
1861 Mortal sin is a radical possibility of human freedom, as is love
itself. It results in the loss of charity and the privation of sanctifying
grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed by repentance
and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and
the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has the power to make
choices for ever, with no turning back. However, although we can
judge that an act is in itself a grave offense, we must entrust judgment
of persons to the justice and mercy of God.
1862 One commits venial sin when, in a less serious matter, he does
not observe the standard prescribed by the moral law, or when he
disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full knowledge or
without complete consent.
1863 Venial sin weakens charity; it manifests a disordered affection for
created goods; it impedes the soul's progress in the exercise of the
virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits temporal
punishment. Deliberate and unrepented venial sin disposes us little by
little to commit mortal sin. However venial sin does not break the
covenant with God. With God's grace it is humanly reparable. "Venial
sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace, friendship with
God, charity, and consequently eternal happiness."134
While he is in the flesh, man cannot help but have at least some light
sins. But do not despise these sins which we call "light": if you take
them for light when you weigh them, tremble when you count them. A
number of light objects makes a great mass; a number of drops fills a
river; a number of grains makes a heap. What then is our hope? Above
all, confession.135
1864 "Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven
men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."136
There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone who deliberately
refuses to accept his mercy by repenting, rejects the forgiveness of his
sins and the salvation offered by the Holy Spirit.137 Such hardness of
heart can lead to final impenitence and eternal loss.

V. The Proliferation of Sin
1865 Sin creates a proclivity to sin; it engenders vice by repetition of
the same acts. This results in perverse inclinations which cloud
conscience and corrupt the concrete judgment of good and evil. Thus
sin tends to reproduce itself and reinforce itself, but it cannot destroy
the moral sense at its root.
1866 Vices can be classified according to the virtues they oppose, or
also be linked to the capital sins which Christian experience has
distinguished, following St. John Cassian and St. Gregory the Great.
They are called "capital" because they engender other sins, other
vices.138 They are pride, avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth
or acedia.
1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are "sins that cry
to heaven": the blood of Abel,139 The sin of the Sodomites,140 The
cry of the people oppressed in Egypt,141 The cry of the foreigner, the
widow, and the orphan,142 injustice to the wage earner.143
1868 Sin is a personal act. Moreover, we have a responsibility for the
sins committed by others when we cooperate in them:
- by participating directly and voluntarily in them;
- by ordering, advising, praising, or approving them;
- by not disclosing or not hindering them when we have an obligation
to do so;
- by protecting evil-doers.
1869 Thus sin makes men accomplices of one another and causes
concupiscence, violence, and injustice to reign among them. Sins give
rise to social situations and institutions that are contrary to the divine
goodness. "Structures of sin" are the expression and effect of personal
sins. They lead their victims to do evil in their turn. In an analogous
sense, they constitute a "social sin."144

IN BRIEF
1870 "God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have
mercy upon all" (Rom 11:32).
1871 Sin is an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law
(St. Augustine, Faust 22: PL 42, 418). It is an offense against God. It
rises up against God in a disobedience contrary to the obedience of
Christ.
1872 Sin is an act contrary to reason. It wounds man's nature and
injures human solidarity.
1873 The root of all sins lies in man's heart. the kinds and the gravity
of sins are determined principally by their objects.
1874 To choose deliberately - that is, both knowing it and willing it -
something gravely contrary to the divine law and to the ultimate end of
man is to commit a mortal sin. This destroys in us the charity without
which eternal beatitude is impossible. Unrepented, it brings eternal
death.
1875 Venial sin constitutes a moral disorder that is reparable by
charity, which it allows to subsist in us.
1876 The repetition of sins - even venial ones - engenders vices, among
which are the capital sins.

CHAPTER TWO THE HUMAN COMMUNION
1877 The vocation of humanity is to show forth the image of God and
to be transformed into the image of the Father's only Son. This
vocation takes a personal form since each of us is called to enter into
the divine beatitude; it also concerns the human community as a
whole.

Article 1 THE PERSON AND SOCIETY
I. The Communal Character of the Human Vocation
1878 All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a
certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the
fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth and
love.1 Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God.
1879 The human person needs to live in society. Society is not for him
an extraneous addition but a requirement of his nature. Through the
exchange with others, mutual service and dialogue with his brethren,
man develops his potential; he thus responds to his vocation.2
1880 A society is a group of persons bound together organically by a
principle of unity that goes beyond each one of them. As an assembly
that is at once visible and spiritual, a society endures through time: it
gathers up the past and prepares for the future. By means of society,
each man is established as an "heir" and receives certain "talents" that
enrich his identity and whose fruits he must develop.3 He rightly owes
loyalty to the communities of which he is part and respect to those in
authority who have charge of the common good.
1881 Each community is defined by its purpose and consequently
obeys specific rules; but "the human person . . . is and ought to be the
principle, the subject and the end of all social institutions."4
1882 Certain societies, such as the family and the state, correspond
more directly to the nature of man; they are necessary to him. To
promote the participation of the greatest number in the life of a
society, the creation of voluntary associations and institutions must be
encouraged "on both national and international levels, which relate to
economic and social goals, to cultural and recreational activities, to
sport, to various professions, and to political affairs."5 This
"socialization" also expresses the natural tendency for human beings to
associate with one another for the sake of attaining objectives that
exceed individual capacities. It develops the qualities of the person,
especially the sense of initiative and responsibility, and helps guarantee
his rights.6
1883 Socialization also presents dangers. Excessive intervention by the
state can threaten personal freedom and initiative. the teaching of the
Church has elaborated the principle of subsidiarity, according to which
"a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life
of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions,
but rather should support it in case of need and help to co-ordinate its
activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to
the common good."7
1884 God has not willed to reserve to himself all exercise of power. He
entrusts to every creature the functions it is capable of performing,
according to the capacities of its own nature. This mode of governance
ought to be followed in social life. the way God acts in governing the
world, which bears witness to such great regard for human freedom,
should inspire the wisdom of those who govern human communities.
They should behave as ministers of divine providence.
1885 The principle of subsidiarity is opposed to all forms of
collectivism. It sets limits for state intervention. It aims at harmonizing
the relationships between individuals and societies. It tends toward the
establishment of true international order.

II. Conversion and Society
1886 Society is essential to the fulfillment of the human vocation. To
attain this aim, respect must be accorded to the just hierarchy of
values, which "subordinates physical and instinctual dimensions to
interior and spiritual ones:"8
Human society must primarily be considered something pertaining to
the spiritual. Through it, in the bright light of truth, men should share
their knowledge, be able to exercise their rights and fulfill their
obligations, be inspired to seek spiritual values; mutually derive
genuine pleasure from the beautiful, of whatever order it be; always be
readily disposed to pass on to others the best of their own cultural
heritage; and eagerly strive to make their own the spiritual
achievements of others. These benefits not only influence, but at the
same time give aim and scope to all that has bearing on cultural
expressions, economic, and social institutions, political movements and
forms, laws, and all other structures by which society is outwardly
established and constantly developed.9
1887 The inversion of means and ends,10 which results in giving the
value of ultimate end to what is only a means for attaining it, or in
viewing persons as mere means to that end, engenders unjust
structures which "make Christian conduct in keeping with the
commandments of the divine Law-giver difficult and almost
impossible."11
1888 It is necessary, then, to appeal to the spiritual and moral
capacities of the human person and to the permanent need for his
inner conversion, so as to obtain social changes that will really serve
him. the acknowledged priority of the conversion of heart in no way
eliminates but on the contrary imposes the obligation of bringing the
appropriate remedies to institutions and living conditions when they
are an inducement to sin, so that they conform to the norms of justice
and advance the good rather than hinder it.12
1889 Without the help of grace, men would not know how "to discern
the often narrow path between the cowardice which gives in to evil,
and the violence which under the illusion of fighting evil only makes it
worse."13 This is the path of charity, that is, of the love of God and of
neighbor. Charity is the greatest social commandment. It respects
others and their rights. It requires the practice of justice, and it alone
makes us capable of it. Charity inspires a life of self-giving: "Whoever
seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve
it."14

Article 1 THE PERSON AND SOCIETY




IN BRIEF
1890 There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine
persons and the fraternity that men ought to establish among
themselves.
1891 The human person needs life in society in order to develop in
accordance with his nature. Certain societies, such as the family and
the state, correspond more directly to the nature of man.
1892 "The human person . . . is and ought to be the principle, the
subject, and the object of every social organization" (GS 25 # 1).
1893 Widespread participation in voluntary associations and
institutions is to be encouraged.
1894 In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, neither the state
nor any larger society should substitute itself for the initiative and
responsibility of individuals and intermediary bodies.
1895 Society ought to promote the exercise of virtue, not obstruct it. It
should be animated by a just hierarchy of values.
1896 Where sin has perverted the social climate, it is necessary to call
for the conversion of hearts and appeal to the grace of God. Charity
urges just reforms. There is no solution to the social question apart
from the Gospel (cf CA 3, 5).

Article 2 PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE
I. Authority
1897 "Human society can be neither well-ordered nor prosperous
unless it has some people invested with legitimate authority to preserve
its institutions and to devote themselves as far as is necessary to work
and care for the good of all."15
By "authority" one means the quality by virtue of which persons or
institutions make laws and give orders to men and expect obedience
from them.
1898 Every human community needs an authority to govern it.16 The
foundation of such authority lies in human nature. It is necessary for
the unity of the state. Its role is to ensure as far as possible the
common good of the society.
1899 The authority required by the moral order derives from God:
"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is
no authority except from God, and those that exist have been
instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what
God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment."17
1900 The duty of obedience requires all to give due honor to authority
and to treat those who are charged to exercise it with respect, and,
insofar as it is deserved, with gratitude and good-will.
Pope St. Clement of Rome provides the Church's most ancient prayer
for political authorities:18 "Grant to them, Lord, health, peace,
concord, and stability, so that they may exercise without offense the
sovereignty that you have given them. Master, heavenly King of the
ages, you give glory, honor, and power over the things of earth to the
sons of men. Direct, Lord, their counsel, following what is pleasing and
acceptable in your sight, so that by exercising with devotion and in
peace and gentleness the power that you have given to them, they may
find favor with you."19
1901 If authority belongs to the order established by God, "the choice
of the political regime and the appointment of rulers are left to the free
decision of the citizens."20
The diversity of political regimes is morally acceptable, provided they
serve the legitimate good of the communities that adopt them.
Regimes whose nature is contrary to the natural law, to the public
order, and to the fundamental rights of persons cannot achieve the
common good of the nations on which they have been imposed.
1902 Authority does not derive its moral legitimacy from itself. It must
not behave in a despotic manner, but must act for the common good
as a "moral force based on freedom and a sense of responsibility":21
A human law has the character of law to the extent that it accords with
right reason, and thus derives from the eternal law. Insofar as it falls
short of right reason it is said to be an unjust law, and thus has not so
much the nature of law as of a kind of violence.22
1903 Authority is exercised legitimately only when it seeks the
common good of the group concerned and if it employs morally licit
means to attain it. If rulers were to enact unjust laws or take measures
contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would not be binding
in conscience. In such a case, "authority breaks down completely and
results in shameful abuse."23
1904 "It is preferable that each power be balanced by other powers and
by other spheres of responsibility which keep it within proper bounds.
This is the principle of the 'rule of law,' in which the law is sovereign
and not the arbitrary will of men."

II. The Common Good
1905 In keeping with the social nature of man, the good of each
individual is necessarily related to the common good, which in turn
can be defined only in reference to the human person:
Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you
were already justified, but gather instead to seek the common good
together.25
1906 By common good is to be understood "the sum total of social
conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to
reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily."26 The common
good concerns the life of all. It calls for prudence from each, and even
more from those who exercise the office of authority. It consists of
three essential elements:
1907 First, the common good presupposes respect for the person as
such. In the name of the common good, public authorities are bound
to respect the fundamental and inalienable rights of the human person.
Society should permit each of its members to fulfill his vocation. In
particular, the common good resides in the conditions for the exercise
of the natural freedoms indispensable for the development of the
human vocation, such as "the right to act according to a sound norm
of conscience and to safeguard . . . privacy, and rightful freedom also in
matters of religion."27
1908 Second, the common good requires the social well-being and
development of the group itself. Development is the epitome of all
social duties. Certainly, it is the proper function of authority to
arbitrate, in the name of the common good, between various particular
interests; but it should make accessible to each what is needed to lead a
truly human life: food, clothing, health, work, education and culture,
suitable information, the right to establish a family, and so on.28
1909 Finally, the common good requires peace, that is, the stability
and security of a just order. It presupposes that authority should
ensure by morally acceptable means the security of society and its
members. It is the basis of the right to legitimate personal and
collective defence.
1910 Each human community possesses a common good which
permits it to be recognized as such; it is in the political community that
its most complete realization is found. It is the role of the state to
defend and promote the common good of civil society, its citizens, and
intermediate bodies.
1911 Human interdependence is increasing and gradually spreading
throughout the world. the unity of the human family, embracing
people who enjoy equal natural dignity, implies a universal common
good. This good calls for an organization of the community of nations
able to "provide for the different needs of men; this will involve the
sphere of social life to which belong questions of food, hygiene,
education, . . . and certain situations arising here and there, as for
example . . . alleviating the miseries of refugees dispersed throughout
the world, and assisting migrants and their families."29
1912 The common good is always oriented towards the progress of
persons: "The order of things must be subordinate to the order of
persons, and not the other way around."30 This order is founded on
truth, built up in justice, and animated by love.

III. Responsibility and Participation
1913 "Participation" is the voluntary and generous engagement of a
person in social interchange. It is necessary that all participate, each
according to his position and role, in promoting the common good.
This obligation is inherent in the dignity of the human person.
1914 Participation is achieved first of all by taking charge of the areas
for which one assumes personal responsibility: by the care taken for the
education of his family, by conscientious work, and so forth, man
participates in the good of others and of society.31
1915 As far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life.
the manner of this participation may vary from one country or culture
to another. "One must pay tribute to those nations whose systems
permit the largest possible number of the citizens to take part in public
life in a climate of genuine freedom."32
1916 As with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in realizing
the common good calls for a continually renewed conversion of the
social partners. Fraud and other subterfuges, by which some people
evade the constraints of the law and the prescriptions of societal
obligation, must be firmly condemned because they are incompatible
with the requirements of justice. Much care should be taken to
promote institutions that improve the conditions of human life.33
1917 It is incumbent on those who exercise authority to strengthen the
values that inspire the confidence of the members of the group and
encourage them to put themselves at the service of others.
Participation begins with education and culture. "One is entitled to
think that the future of humanity is in the hands of those who are
capable of providing the generations to come with reasons for life and
optimism."34

IN BRIEF
1918 "There is no authority except from God, and those authorities
that exist have been instituted by God" (Rom 13:1).
1919 Every human community needs an authority in order to endure
and develop.
1920 "The political community and public authority are based on
human nature and therefore . . . belong to an order established by
God" (GS 74 # 3).
1921 Authority is exercised legitimately if it is committed to the
common good of society. To attain this it must employ morally
acceptable means.
1922 The diversity of political regimes is legitimate, provided they
contribute to the good of the community.
1923 Political authority must be exercised within the limits of the
moral order and must guarantee the conditions for the exercise of
freedom.
1924 The common good comprises "the sum total of social conditions
which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their
fulfillment more fully and more easily" (GS 26 1).
1925 The common good consists of three essential elements: respect
for and promotion of the fundamental rights of the person; prosperity,
or the development of the spiritual and temporal goods of society; the
peace and security of the group and of its members.
1926 The dignity of the human person requires the pursuit of the
common good. Everyone should be concerned to create and support
institutions that improve the conditions of human life.
1927 It is the role of the state to defend and promote the common
good of civil society. the common good of the whole human family
calls for an organization of society on the international level.

I. Respect For the Human Person
1929 Social justice can be obtained only in respecting the transcendent
dignity of man. the person represents the ultimate end of society,
which is ordered to him:
What is at stake is the dignity of the human person, whose defense and
promotion have been entrusted to us by the Creator, and to whom the
men and women at every moment of history are strictly and
responsibly in debt.35
1930 Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights that
flow from his dignity as a creature. These rights are prior to society and
must be recognized by it. They are the basis of the moral legitimacy of
every authority: by flouting them, or refusing to recognize them in its
positive legislation, a society undermines its own moral legitimacy.36 If
it does not respect them, authority can rely only on force or violence to
obtain obedience from its subjects. It is the Church's role to remind
men of good will of these rights and to distinguish them from
unwarranted or false claims.
1931 Respect for the human person proceeds by way of respect for the
principle that "everyone should look upon his neighbor (without any
exception) as 'another self,' above all bearing in mind his life and the
means necessary for living it with dignity."37 No legislation could by
itself do away with the fears, prejudices, and attitudes of pride and
selfishness which obstruct the establishment of truly fraternal societies.
Such behavior will cease only through the charity that finds in every
man a "neighbor," a brother.
1932 The duty of making oneself a neighbor to others and actively
serving them becomes even more urgent when it involves the
disadvantaged, in whatever area this may be. "As you did it to one of
the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."38
1933 This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from
us. the teaching of Christ goes so far as to require the forgiveness of
offenses. He extends the commandment of love, which is that of the
New Law, to all enemies.39 Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is
incompatible with hatred of one's enemy as a person, but not with
hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy.

II. Equality and Differences Among Men
1934 Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with
rational souls, all men have the same nature and the same origin.
Redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ, all are called to participate in the
same divine beatitude: all therefore enjoy an equal dignity.
1935 The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as persons
and the rights that flow from it:
Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamental
personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, color, social conditions,
language, or religion must be curbed and eradicated as incompatible
with God's design.40
1936 On coming into the world, man is not equipped with everything
he needs for developing his bodily and spiritual life. He needs others.
Differences appear tied to age, physical abilities, intellectual or moral
aptitudes, the benefits derived from social commerce, and the
distribution of wealth.41 The "talents" are not distributed equally.42
1937 These differences belong to God's plan, who wills that each
receive what he needs from others, and that those endowed with
particular "talents" share the benefits with those who need them. These
differences encourage and often oblige persons to practice generosity,
kindness, and sharing of goods; they foster the mutual enrichment of
cultures:
I distribute the virtues quite diversely; I do not give all of them to each
person, but some to one, some to others.... I shall give principally
charity to one; justice to another; humility to this one, a living faith to
that one.... and so I have given many gifts and graces, both spiritual
and temporal, with such diversity that I have not given everything to
one single person, so that you may be constrained to practice charity
towards one another.... I have willed that one should need another and
that all should be my ministers in distributing the graces and gifts they
have received from me.43
1938 There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and
women. These are in open contradiction of the Gospel:
Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for fairer and
more humane conditions. Excessive economic and social disparity
between individuals and peoples of the one human race is a source of
scandal and militates against social justice, equity, human dignity, as
well as social and international peace.44

III. Human Solidarity
1939 The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of
"friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and
Christian brotherhood.45
An error, "today abundantly widespread, is disregard for the law of
human solidarity and charity, dictated and imposed both by our
common origin and by the equality in rational nature of all men,
whatever nation they belong to. This law is sealed by the sacrifice of
redemption offered by Jesus Christ on the altar of the Cross to his
heavenly Father, on behalf of sinful humanity."46
1940 Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of
goods and remuneration for work. It also presupposes the effort for a
more just social order where tensions are better able to be reduced and
conflicts more readily settled by negotiation.
1941 Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of
all the forms of solidarity: solidarity of the poor among themselves,
between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, between
employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and
peoples. International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order;
world peace depends in part upon this.
1942 The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading
the spiritual goods of the faith, the Church has promoted, and often
opened new paths for, the development of temporal goods as well. and
so throughout the centuries has the Lord's saying been verified: "Seek
first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be
yours as well":47
For two thousand years this sentiment has lived and endured in the
soul of the Church, impelling souls then and now to the heroic charity
of monastic farmers, liberators of slaves, healers of the sick, and
messengers of faith, civilization, and science to all generations and all
peoples for the sake of creating the social conditions capable of offering
to everyone possible a life worthy of man and of a Christian.48

Article 3 SOCIAL JUSTICE
IN BRIEF
1943 Society ensures social justice by providing the conditions that
allow associations and individuals to obtain their due.
1944 Respect for the human person considers the other "another self."
It presupposes respect for the fundamental rights that flow from the
dignity intrinsic of the person.
1945 The equality of men concerns their dignity as persons and the
rights that flow from it.
1946 The differences among persons belong to God's plan, who wills
that we should need one another. These differences should encourage
charity.
1947 The equal dignity of human persons requires the effort to reduce
excessive social and economic inequalities. It gives urgency to the
elimination of sinful inequalities.
1948 Solidarity is an eminently Christian virtue. It practices the
sharing of spiritual goods even more than material ones.

1949 Called to beatitude but wounded by sin, man stands in need of
salvation from God. Divine help comes to him in Christ through the
law that guides him and the grace that sustains him:
Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for God is at
work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.1

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW
1950 The moral law is the work of divine Wisdom. Its biblical meaning
can be defined as fatherly instruction, God's pedagogy. It prescribes for
man the ways, the rules of conduct that lead to the promised beatitude;
it proscribes the ways of evil which turn him away from God and his
love. It is at once firm in its precepts and, in its promises, worthy of
love.
1951 Law is a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the
sake of the common good. the moral law presupposes the rational
order, established among creatures for their good and to serve their
final end, by the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator. All law
finds its first and ultimate truth in the eternal law. Law is declared and
established by reason as a participation in the providence of the living
God, Creator and Redeemer of all. "Such an ordinance of reason is
what one calls law."2
Alone among all animate beings, man can boast of having been
counted worthy to receive a law from God: as an animal endowed with
reason, capable of understanding and discernment, he is to govern his
conduct by using his freedom and reason, in obedience to the One who
has entrusted everything to him.3
1952 There are different expressions of the moral law, all of them
interrelated: eternal law - the source, in God, of all law; natural law;
revealed law, comprising the Old Law and the New Law, or Law of the
Gospel; finally, civil and ecclesiastical laws.


1953 The moral law finds its fullness and its unity in Christ. Jesus
Christ is in person the way of perfection. He is the end of the law, for
only he teaches and bestows the justice of God: "For Christ is the end
of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified."4

Article 1 THE MORAL LAW




I. The Natural Moral Law
1954 Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator
who gives him mastery over his acts and the ability to govern himself
with a view to the true and the good.
The natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man
to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie:
The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every
man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and
forbidding him to sin . . . But this command of human reason would
not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a
higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be
submitted.5
1955 The "divine and natural" law6 shows man the way to follow so as
to practice the good and attain his end. the natural law states the first
and essential precepts which govern the moral life. It hinges upon the
desire for God and submission to him, who is the source and judge of
all that is good, as well as upon the sense that the other is one's equal.
Its principal precepts are expressed in the Decalogue. This law is called
"natural," not in reference to the nature of irrational beings, but
because reason which decrees it properly belongs to human nature:
Where then are these rules written, if not in the book of that light we
call the truth? In it is written every just law; from it the law passes into
the heart of the man who does justice, not that it migrates into it, but
that it places its imprint on it, like a seal on a ring that passes onto wax,
without leaving the ring.7
The natural law is nothing other than the light of understanding placed
in us by God; through it we know what we must do and what we must
avoid. God has given this light or law at the creation.8
1956 The natural law, present in the heart of each man and established
by reason, is universal in its precepts and its authority extends to all
men. It expresses the dignity of the person and determines the basis for
his fundamental rights and duties:
For there is a true law: right reason. It is in conformity with nature, is
diffused among all men, and is immutable and eternal; its orders
summon to duty; its prohibitions turn away from offense .... To replace
it with a contrary law is a sacrilege; failure to apply even one of its
provisions is forbidden; no one can abrogate it entirely.9
1957 Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can demand
reflection that takes account of various conditions of life according to
places, times, and circumstances. Nevertheless, in the diversity of
cultures, the natural law remains as a rule that binds men among
themselves and imposes on them, beyond the inevitable differences,
common principles.
1958 The natural law is immutable and permanent throughout the
variations of history;10 it subsists under the flux of ideas and customs
and supports their progress. the rules that express it remain
substantially valid. Even when it is rejected in its very principles, it
cannot be destroyed or removed from the heart of man. It always rises
again in the life of individuals and societies:
Theft is surely punished by your law, O Lord, and by the law that is
written in the human heart, the law that iniquity itself does not
efface.11
1959 The natural law, the Creator's very good work, provides the solid
foundation on which man can build the structure of moral rules to
guide his choices. It also provides the indispensable moral foundation
for building the human community. Finally, it provides the necessary
basis for the civil law with which it is connected, whether by a
reflection that draws conclusions from its principles, or by additions of
a positive and juridical nature.
1960 The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone clearly
and immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs grace and
revelation so moral and religious truths may be known "by everyone
with facility, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error."12
The natural law provides revealed law and grace with a foundation
prepared by God and in accordance with the work of the Spirit.

II. The Old Law
1961 God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself to be
his people and revealed his Law to them, thus preparing for the coming
of Christ. the Law of Moses expresses many truths naturally accessible
to reason. These are stated and authenticated within the covenant of
salvation.
1962 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments. the precepts
of the Decalogue lay the foundations for the vocation of man fashioned
in the image of God; they prohibit what is contrary to the love of God
and neighbor and prescribe what is essential to it. the Decalogue is a
light offered to the conscience of every man to make God's call and
ways known to him and to protect him against evil:
God wrote on the tables of the Law what men did not read in their
hearts.13
1963 According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual, and
good,14 yet still imperfect. Like a tutor15 it shows what must be done,
but does not of itself give the strength, the grace of the Spirit, to fulfill
it. Because of sin, which it cannot remove, it remains a law of bondage.
According to St. Paul, its special function is to denounce and disclose
sin, which constitutes a "law of concupiscence" in the human heart.16
However, the Law remains the first stage on the way to the kingdom. It
prepares and disposes the chosen people and each Christian for
conversion and faith in the Savior God. It provides a teaching which
endures for ever, like the Word of God.
1964 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. "The Law is a
pedagogy and a prophecy of things to come."17 It prophesies and
presages the work of liberation from sin which will be fulfilled in
Christ: it provides the New Testament with images, "types," and
symbols for expressing the life according to the Spirit. Finally, the Law
is completed by the teaching of the sapiential books and the prophets
which set its course toward the New Covenant and the Kingdom of
heaven.
There were . . . under the regimen of the Old Covenant, people who
possessed the charity and grace of the Holy Spirit and longed above all
for the spiritual and eternal promises by which they were associated
with the New Law. Conversely, there exist carnal men under the New
Covenant still distanced from the perfection of the New Law: the fear
of punishment and certain temporal promises have been necessary,
even under the New Covenant, to incite them to virtuous works. In any
case, even though the Old Law prescribed charity, it did not give the
Holy Spirit, through whom "God's charity has been poured into our
hearts."18

III. The New Law or the Law of the Gospel
1965 The New Law or the Law of the Gospel is the perfection here on
earth of the divine law, natural and revealed. It is the work of Christ
and is expressed particularly in the Sermon on the Mount. It is also the
work of the Holy Spirit and through him it becomes the interior law of
charity: "I will establish a New Covenant with the house of Israel. . . . I
will put my laws into their hands, and write them on their hearts, and I
will be their God, and they shall be my people."19
1966 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit given to the faithful
through faith in Christ. It works through charity; it uses the Sermon on
the Mount to teach us what must be done and makes use of the
sacraments to give us the grace to do it:
If anyone should meditate with devotion and perspicacity on the
sermon our Lord gave on the mount, as we read in the Gospel of Saint
Matthew, he will doubtless find there . . . the perfect way of the
Christian life.... This sermon contains ... all the precepts needed to
shape one's life.20
1967 The Law of the Gospel "fulfills," refines, surpasses, and leads the
Old Law to its perfection.21 In the Beatitudes, the New Law fulfills
the divine promises by elevating and orienting them toward the
"kingdom of heaven." It is addressed to those open to accepting this
new hope with faith - the poor, the humble, the afflicted, the pure of
heart, those persecuted on account of Christ and so marks out the
surprising ways of the Kingdom.
1968 The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law.
the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the
moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and
has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and
human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to
reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between
the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed
and with them the other virtues. the Gospel thus brings the Law to its
fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father,
through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in
emulation of the divine generosity.23
1969 The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer
and fasting, directing them to the "Father who sees in secret," in
contrast with the desire to "be seen by men."24 Its prayer is the Our
Father.25
1970 The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice
between "the two ways" and to put into practice the words of the
Lord.26 It is summed up in the Golden Rule, "Whatever you wish that
men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the
prophets."27
The entire Law of the Gospel is contained in the "new commandment"
of Jesus, to love one another as he has loved us.28
1971 To the Lord's Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add the moral
catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1
Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This doctrine
hands on the Lord's teaching with the authority of the apostles,
particularly in the presentation of the virtues that flow from faith in
Christ and are animated by charity, the principal gift of the Holy
Spirit. "Let charity be genuine.... Love one another with brotherly
affection.... Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant
in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality."29
This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the
light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.30
1972 The New Law is called a law of love because it makes us act out
of the love infused by the Holy Spirit, rather than from fear; a law of
grace, because it confers the strength of grace to act, by means of faith
and the sacraments; a law of freedom, because it sets us free from the
ritual and juridical observances of the Old Law, inclines us to act
spontaneously by the prompting of charity and, finally, lets us pass
from the condition of a servant who "does not know what his master is
doing" to that of a friend of Christ - "For all that I have heard from my
Father I have made known to you" - or even to the status of son and
heir.31
1973 Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical
counsels. the traditional distinction between God's commandments
and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to charity, the
perfection of Christian life. the precepts are intended to remove
whatever is incompatible with charity. the aim of the counsels is to
remove whatever might hinder the development of charity, even if it is
not contrary to it.32
1974 The evangelical counsels manifest the living fullness of charity,
which is never satisfied with not giving more. They attest its vitality and
call forth our spiritual readiness. the perfection of the New Law
consists essentially in the precepts of love of God and neighbor. the
counsels point out the more direct ways, the readier means, and are to
be practiced in keeping with the vocation of each:
(God) does not want each person to keep all the counsels, but only
those appropriate to the diversity of persons, times, opportunities, and
strengths, as charity requires; for it is charity, as queen of all virtues, all
commandments, all counsels, and, in short, of all laws and all Christian
actions that gives to all of them their rank, order, time, and value.33

IN BRIEF
1975 According to Scripture the Law is a fatherly instruction by God
which prescribes for man the ways that lead to the promised beatitude,
and proscribes the ways of evil.
1976 "Law is an ordinance of reason for the common good,
promulgated by the one who is in charge of the community" (St.
Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 90, 4).
1977 Christ is the end of the law (cf Rom 10:4); only he teaches and
bestows the justice of God.
1978 The natural law is a participation in God's wisdom and goodness
by man formed in the image of his Creator. It expresses the dignity of
the human person and forms the basis of his fundamental rights and
duties.
1979 The natural law is immutable, permanent throughout history. the
rules that express it remain substantially valid. It is a necessary
foundation for the erection of moral rules and civil law.
1980 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed law. Its moral
prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments.
1981 The Law of Moses contains many truths naturally accessible to
reason. God has revealed them because men did not read them in their
hearts.
1982 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel.
1983 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit received by faith in
Christ, operating through charity. It finds expression above all in the
Lord's Sermon on the Mount and uses the sacraments to communicate
grace to us.
1984 The Law of the Gospel fulfills and surpasses the Old Law and
brings it to perfection: its promises, through the Beatitudes of the
Kingdom of heaven; its commandments, by reforming the heart, the
root of human acts.
1985 The New Law is a law of love, a law of grace, a law of freedom.
1986 Besides its precepts the New Law includes the evangelical
counsels. "The Church's holiness is fostered in a special way by the
manifold counsels which the Lord proposes to his disciples in the
Gospel" (LG 42 # 2).

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION
I. Justification
1987 The grace of the Holy Spirit has the power to justify us, that is, to
cleanse us from our sins and to communicate to us "the righteousness
of God through faith in Jesus Christ" and through Baptism:34
But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
him. For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die
again; death no longer has dominion over him. the death he died he
died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you
also must consider yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ
Jesus.35
1988 Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in Christ's
Passion by dying to sin, and in his Resurrection by being born to a new
life; we are members of his Body which is the Church, branches grafted
onto the vine which is himself:36
(God) gave himself to us through his Spirit. By the participation of the
Spirit, we become communicants in the divine nature.... For this
reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells are divinized.37
1989 The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion,
effecting justification in accordance with Jesus' proclamation at the
beginning of the Gospel: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand."38 Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin,
thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high.
"Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also the
sanctification and renewal of the interior man.39
1990 Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the love of
God, and purifies his heart of sin. Justification follows upon God's
merciful initiative of offering forgiveness. It reconciles man with God.
It frees from the enslavement to sin, and it heals.
1991 Justification is at the same time the acceptance of God's
righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. Righteousness (or
"justice") here means the rectitude of divine love. With justification,
faith, hope, and charity are poured into our hearts, and obedience to
the divine will is granted us.
1992 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who
offered himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and pleasing to
God, and whose blood has become the instrument of atonement for
the sins of all men. Justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament
of faith. It conforms us to the righteousness of God, who makes us
inwardly just by the power of his mercy. Its purpose is the glory of God
and of Christ, and the gift of eternal life:40
But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law,
although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness
of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no
distinction: since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which
is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as an expiation by his blood,
to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because
in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was to
prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he
justifies him who has faith in Jesus.41
1993 Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and
man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to
the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the
cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who
precedes and preserves his assent:
When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy
Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since
he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own
free will move himself toward justice in God's sight.42
1994 Justification is the most excellent work of God's love made
manifest in Christ Jesus and granted by the Holy Spirit. It is the
opinion of St. Augustine that "the justification of the wicked is a
greater work than the creation of heaven and earth," because "heaven
and earth will pass away but the salvation and justification of the elect .
. . will not pass away."43 He holds also that the justification of sinners
surpasses the creation of the angels in justice, in that it bears witness to
a greater mercy.
1995 The Holy Spirit is the master of the interior life. By giving birth
to the "inner man,"44 justification entails the sanctification of his
whole being:
Just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and
greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for
sanctification.... But now that you have been set free from sin and have
become slaves of God, the return you get is sanctification and its end,
eternal life.45

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION
II. Grace
1996 Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is favor,
the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to
become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature
and of eternal life.46
1997 Grace is a participation in the life of God. It introduces us into
the intimacy of Trinitarian life: by Baptism the Christian participates in
the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an "adopted son" he can
henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives
the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the
Church.
1998 This vocation to eternal life is supernatural. It depends entirely
on God's gratuitous initiative, for he alone can reveal and give himself.
It surpasses the power of human intellect and will, as that of every
other creature.47
1999 The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes to us of
his own life, infused by the Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it of sin
and to sanctify it. It is the sanctifying or deifying grace received in
Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of sanctification:48
Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has
passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who
through Christ reconciled us to himself.49
2000 Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural
disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live with God, to
act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent disposition to live and
act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from actual graces
which refer to God's interventions, whether at the beginning of
conversion or in the course of the work of sanctification.
2001 The preparation of man for the reception of grace is already a
work of grace. This latter is needed to arouse and sustain our
collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification
through charity. God brings to completion in us what he has begun,
"since he who completes his work by cooperating with our will began
by working so that we might will it:"50
Indeed we also work, but we are only collaborating with God who
works, for his mercy has gone before us. It has gone before us so that
we may be healed, and follows us so that once healed, we may be given
life; it goes before us so that we may be called, and follows us so that
we may be glorified; it goes before us so that we may live devoutly, and
follows us so that we may always live with God: for without him we can
do nothing.51
2002 God's free initiative demands man's free response, for God has
created man in his image by conferring on him, along with freedom,
the power to know him and love him. the soul only enters freely into
the communion of love. God immediately touches and directly moves
the heart of man. He has placed in man a longing for truth and
goodness that only he can satisfy. the promises of "eternal life"
respond, beyond all hope, to this desire:
If at the end of your very good works . . ., you rested on the seventh
day, it was to foretell by the voice of your book that at the end of our
works, which are indeed "very good" since you have given them to us,
we shall also rest in you on the sabbath of eternal life.52
2003 Grace is first and foremost the gift of the Spirit who justifies and
sanctifies us. But grace also includes the gifts that the Spirit grants us
to associate us with his work, to enable us to collaborate in the
salvation of others and in the growth of the Body of Christ, the
Church. There are sacramental graces, gifts proper to the different
sacraments. There are furthermore special graces, also called charisms
after the Greek term used by St. Paul and meaning "favor," "gratuitous
gift," "benefit."53 Whatever their character - sometimes it is
extraordinary, such as the gift of miracles or of tongues - charisms are
oriented toward sanctifying grace and are intended for the common
good of the Church. They are at the service of charity which builds up
the Church.54
2004 Among the special graces ought to be mentioned the graces of
state that accompany the exercise of the responsibilities of the
Christian life and of the ministries within the Church:
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use
them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving;
he who teaches, in his teaching; he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he
who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he who does
acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.55
2005 Since it belongs to the supernatural order, grace escapes our
experience and cannot be known except by faith. We cannot therefore
rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are justified and
saved.56 However, according to the Lord's words "Thus you will know
them by their fruits"57 - reflection on God's blessings in our life and in
the lives of the saints offers us a guarantee that grace is at work in us
and spurs us on to an ever greater faith and an attitude of trustful
poverty.
A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply of St. Joan
of Arc to a question posed as a trap by her ecclesiastical judges: "Asked
if she knew that she was in God's grace, she replied: 'If I am not, may it
please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me
there.'"58

III. Merit
You are glorified in the assembly of your Holy Ones, for in crowning
their merits you are crowning your own gifts.59
2006 The term "merit" refers in general to the recompense owed by a
community or a society for the action of one of its members,
experienced either as beneficial or harmful, deserving reward or
punishment. Merit is relative to the virtue of justice, in conformity with
the principle of equality which governs it.
2007 With regard to God, there is no strict right to any merit on the
part of man. Between God and us there is an immeasurable inequality,
for we have received everything from him, our Creator.
2008 The merit of man before God in the Christian life arises from the
fact that God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his
grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then
follows man's free acting through his collaboration, so that the merit of
good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of God,
then to the faithful. Man's merit, moreover, itself is due to God, for his
good actions proceed in Christ, from the predispositions and assistance
given by the Holy Spirit.
2009 Filial adoption, in making us partakers by grace in the divine
nature, can bestow true merit on us as a result of God's gratuitous
justice. This is our right by grace, the full right of love, making us "co-
heirs" with Christ and worthy of obtaining "the promised inheritance
of eternal life."60 The merits of our good works are gifts of the divine
goodness.61 "Grace has gone before us; now we are given what is
due.... Our merits are God's gifts."62
2010 Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one
can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the
beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we
can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our
sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the
attainment of eternal life. Even temporal goods like health and
friendship can be merited in accordance with God's wisdom. These
graces and goods are the object of Christian prayer. Prayer attends to
the grace we need for meritorious actions.
2011 The charity of Christ is the source in us of all our merits before
God. Grace, by uniting us to Christ in active love, ensures the
supernatural quality of our acts and consequently their merit before
God and before men. the saints have always had a lively awareness that
their merits were pure grace.
After earth's exile, I hope to go and enjoy you in the fatherland, but I
do not want to lay up merits for heaven. I want to work for your love
alone.... In the evening of this life, I shall appear before you with empty
hands, for I do not ask you, Lord, to count my works. All our justice is
blemished in your eyes. I wish, then, to be clothed in your own justice
and to receive from your love the eternal possession of yourself.63

IV. Christian Holiness
2012 "We know that in everything God works for good with those who
love him . . . For those whom he fore knew he also predestined to be
conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-
born among many brethren. and those whom he predestined he also
called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he
justified he also glorified."64
2013 "All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the
fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity."65 All are
called to holiness: "Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."66
In order to reach this perfection the faithful should use the strength
dealt out to them by Christ's gift, so that . . . doing the will of the
Father in everything, they may wholeheartedly devote themselves to
the glory of God and to the service of their neighbor. Thus the holiness
of the People of God will grow in fruitful abundance, as is clearly
shown in the history of the Church through the lives of so many
saints.67
2014 Spiritual progress tends toward ever more intimate union with
Christ. This union is called "mystical" because it participates in the
mystery of Christ through the sacraments - "the holy mysteries" - and,
in him, in the mystery of the Holy Trinity. God calls us all to this
intimate union with him, even if the special graces or extraordinary
signs of this mystical life are granted only to some for the sake of
manifesting the gratuitous gift given to all.
2015 The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no
holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle.68 Spiritual progress
entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the
peace and joy of the Beatitudes:
He who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning,
through beginnings that have no end. He never stops desiring what he
already knows.69
2016 The children of our holy mother the Church rightly hope for the
grace of final perseverance and the recompense of God their Father for
the good works accomplished with his grace in communion with
Jesus.70 Keeping the same rule of life, believers share the "blessed
hope" of those whom the divine mercy gathers into the "holy city, the
new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a
bride adorned for her husband."71

Article 2 GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION




IN BRIEF
2017 The grace of the Holy Spirit confers upon us the righteousness of
God. Uniting us by faith and Baptism to the Passion and Resurrection
of Christ, the Spirit makes us sharers in his life.
2018 Like conversion, justification has two aspects. Moved by grace,
man turns toward God and away from sin, and so accepts forgiveness
and righteousness from on high.
2019 Justification includes the remission of sins, sanctification, and the
renewal of the inner man.
2020 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ. It
is granted us through Baptism. It conforms us to the righteousness of
God, who justifies us. It has for its goal the glory of God and of Christ,
and the gift of eternal life. It is the most excellent work of God's mercy.
2021 Grace is the help God gives us to respond to our vocation of
becoming his adopted sons. It introduces us into the intimacy of the
Trinitarian life.
2022 The divine initiative in the work of grace precedes, prepares, and
elicits the free response of man. Grace responds to the deepest
yearnings of human freedom, calls freedom to cooperate with it, and
perfects freedom.
2023 Sanctifying grace is the gratuitous gift of his life that God makes
to us; it is infused by the Holy Spirit into the soul to heal it of sin and
to sanctify it.
2024 Sanctifying grace makes us "pleasing to God." Charisms, special
graces of the Holy Spirit, are oriented to sanctifying grace and are
intended for the common good of the Church. God also acts through
many actual graces, to be distinguished from habitual grace which is
permanent in us.
2025 We can have merit in God's sight only because of God's free plan
to associate man with the work of his grace. Merit is to be ascribed in
the first place to the grace of God, and secondly to man's
collaboration. Man's merit is due to God.
2026 The grace of the Holy Spirit can confer true merit on us, by
virtue of our adoptive filiation, and in accordance with God's
gratuitous justice. Charity is the principal source of merit in us before
God.
2027 No one can merit the initial grace which is at the origin of
conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit, we can merit for ourselves and
for others all the graces needed to attain eternal life, as well as
necessary temporal goods.
2028 "All Christians . . . are called to the fullness of Christian life and
to the perfection of charity" (LG 40 # 2). "Christian perfection has but
one limit, that of having none" (St. Gregory of Nyssa, De vita Mos.:
PG 44, 300D).
2029 "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take
up his cross and follow me" (Mt 16:24).

Article 3 THE CHURCH, MOTHER AND TEACHER
2030 It is in the Church, in communion with all the baptized, that the
Christian fulfills his vocation. From the Church he receives the Word of
God containing the teachings of "the law of Christ."72 From the
Church he receives the grace of the sacraments that sustains him on
the "way." From the Church he learns the example of holiness and
recognizes its model and source in the all-holy Virgin Mary; he
discerns it in the authentic witness of those who live it; he discovers it
in the spiritual tradition and long history of the saints who have gone
before him and whom the liturgy celebrates in the rhythms of the
sanctoral cycle.
2031 The moral life is spiritual worship. We "present (our) bodies as a
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,"73 within the Body of
Christ that we form and in communion with the offering of his
Eucharist. In the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments, prayer
and teaching are conjoined with the grace of Christ to enlighten and
nourish Christian activity. As does the whole of the Christian life, the
moral life finds its source and summit in the Eucharistic sacrifice.

I. Moral Life and the Magisterium of the Church
2032 The Church, the "pillar and bulwark of the truth," "has received
this solemn command of Christ from the apostles to announce the
saving truth."74 "To the Church belongs the right always and
everywhere to announce moral principles, including those pertaining
to the social order, and to make judgments on any human affairs to the
extent that they are required by the fundamental rights of the human
person or the salvation of souls."75
2033 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters
is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, with the help of the
works of theologians and spiritual authors. Thus from generation to
generation, under the aegis and vigilance of the pastors, the "deposit"
of Christian moral teaching has been handed on, a deposit composed
of a characteristic body of rules, commandments, and virtues
proceeding from faith in Christ and animated by charity. Alongside the
Creed and the Our Father, the basis for this catechesis has traditionally
been the Decalogue which sets out the principles of moral life valid for
all men.
2034 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops are "authentic teachers, that
is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach the faith
to the people entrusted to them, the faith to be believed and put into
practice."76 The ordinary and universal Magisterium of the Pope and
the bishops in communion with him teach the faithful the truth to
believe, the charity to practice, the beatitude to hope for.
2035 The supreme degree of participation in the authority of Christ is
ensured by the charism of infallibility. This infallibility extends as far as
does the deposit of divine Revelation; it also extends to all those
elements of doctrine, including morals, without which the saving truths
of the faith cannot be preserved, explained, or observed.77
2036 The authority of the Magisterium extends also to the specific
precepts of the natural law, because their observance, demanded by the
Creator, is necessary for salvation. In recalling the prescriptions of the
natural law, the Magisterium of the Church exercises an essential part
of its prophetic office of proclaiming to men what they truly are and
reminding them of what they should be before God.78
2037 The law of God entrusted to the Church is taught to the faithful
as the way of life and truth. the faithful therefore have the right to be
instructed in the divine saving precepts that purify judgment and, with
grace, heal wounded human reason.79 They have the duty of observing
the constitutions and decrees conveyed by the legitimate authority of
the Church. Even if they concern disciplinary matters, these
determinations call for docility in charity.
2038 In the work of teaching and applying Christian morality, the
Church needs the dedication of pastors, the knowledge of theologians,
and the contribution of all Christians and men of good will. Faith and
the practice of the Gospel provide each person with an experience of
life "in Christ," who enlightens him and makes him able to evaluate the
divine and human realities according to the Spirit of God.80 Thus the
Holy Spirit can use the humblest to enlighten the learned and those in
the highest positions.


2039 Ministries should be exercised in a spirit of fraternal service and
dedication to the Church, in the name of the Lord.81 At the same time
the conscience of each person should avoid confining itself to
individualistic considerations in its moral judgments of the person's
own acts. As far as possible conscience should take account of the good
of all, as expressed in the moral law, natural and revealed, and
consequently in the law of the Church and in the authoritative
teaching of the Magisterium on moral questions. Personal conscience
and reason should not be set in opposition to the moral law or the
Magisterium of the Church.
2040 Thus a true filial spirit toward the Church can develop among
Christians. It is the normal flowering of the baptismal grace which has
begotten us in the womb of the Church and made us members of the
Body of Christ. In her motherly care, the Church grants us the mercy
of God which prevails over all our sins and is especially at work in the
sacrament of reconciliation. With a mother's foresight, she also lavishes
on us day after day in her liturgy the nourishment of the Word and
Eucharist of the Lord.

II. The Precepts of the Church
2041 The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life
bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory character of
these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant to
guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of
prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor:
2042 The first precept (“You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on
holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor.") requires the
faithful to sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the
Lord as well as the principal feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord,
the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints; in the first place, by participate
in the Eucharistic celebration, in which the Christian community is
gathered, and by resting from those works and activities which could
impede such a sanctification of these days.82


The second precept (“You shall confess your sins at least once a year.")
ensures preparation for the Eucharist by the reception of the sacrament
of reconciliation, which continues Baptism's work of conversion and
forgiveness.83
The third precept (“You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at
least during the Easter season.") guarantees as a minimum the
reception of the Lord's Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal
feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy.84
2043 The fourth precept (“You shall observe the days of fasting and
abstinence established by the Church.") ensures the times of ascesis
and penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and help us
acquire mastery over our instincts and freedom of heart.85
The fifth precept (“You shall help to provide for the needs of the
Church.") ensures that the faithful are obliged to assist with the
material needs of the Church, each according to his own ability.86
The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of
the Church, each according to his abilities.87

III. Moral Life and Missionary Witness
2044 The fidelity of the baptized is a primordial condition for the
proclamation of the Gospel and for the Church's mission in the world.
In order that the message of salvation can show the power of its truth
and radiance before men, it must be authenticated by the witness of
the life of Christians. "The witness of a Christian life and good works
done in a supernatural spirit have great power to draw men to the faith
and to God."88
2045 Because they are members of the Body whose Head is Christ,89
Christians contribute to building up the Church by the constancy of
their convictions and their moral lives. the Church increases, grows,
and develops through the holiness of her faithful, until "we all attain to
the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to
mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ."90
2046 By living with the mind of Christ, Christians hasten the coming
of the Reign of God, "a kingdom of justice, love, and peace."91 They
do not, for all that, abandon their earthly tasks; faithful to their master,
they fulfill them with uprightness, patience, and love.

IN BRIEF
2047 The moral life is a spiritual worship. Christian activity finds its
nourishment in the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments.
2048 The precepts of the Church concern the moral and Christian life
united with the liturgy and nourished by it.
2049 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters
is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, on the basis of the
Decalogue which states the principles of moral life valid for every man.
2050 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops, as authentic teachers,
preach to the People of God the faith which is to be believed and
applied in moral life. It is also encumbent on them to pronounce on
moral questions that fall within the natural law and reason.
2051 The infallibility of the Magisterium of the Pastors extends to all
the elements of doctrine, including
moral doctrine, without which the saving truths of the faith cannot be
preserved, expounded, or observed.
The Ten Commandments
Exodus 20 2-17
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of bondage.
You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself
a graven image, or any likeness
of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
that is in the water under the
earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD
your God am a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and
the fourth generation of those
who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who
love me and keep my
commandments.
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless
who takes his name in vain.
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor,
and do all your work; but the
seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; in it you shall not do
any work, you, or your son, or
your daughter, your manservant or your maidservant or your cattle, or
the sojourner who is within your
gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that is in them, and rested the
seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed
it.
Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the
land which the LORD your God
gives you.
You shall not kill.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his manservant
or his maidservant or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your
neighbor's.
Deuteronomy 5:6-21
I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt
out of the house of bondage.
You shall have no other gods before me . . .
You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain . . .
Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy. . .
Honor your father and your mother . . .
You shall not kill.
Neither shall you commit adultery.
Neither shall you steal.
Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.
Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife .

PART THREE: LIFE IN CHRIST




SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
"Teacher, what must I do . . .?"
2052 "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" To the
young man who asked this question,
Jesus answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the
"One there is who is good," as the
supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: "If you
would enter life, keep the
commandments." and he cites for his questioner the precepts that
concern love of neighbor: "You shall not
kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not
bear false witness, Honor your father
and mother." Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively:
"You shall love your neighbor as
yourself."1
2053 To this first reply Jesus adds a second: "If you would be perfect,
go, sell what you possess and give to the
poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."2
This reply does not do away with the
first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. the
Law has not been abolished,3 but
rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is
its perfect fulfillment. In the three
synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in
the obedience of a disciple and in the
observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and
chastity.4 The evangelical counsels
are inseparable from the Commandments.
2054 Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed
the power of the Spirit at work in
their letter. He preached a "righteousness [which] exceeds that of the
scribes and Pharisees"5 as well as that
of the Gentiles.6 He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments.
"You have heard that it was said to
the men of old, 'You shall not kill.' . . . But I say to you that every one
who is angry with his brother shall be
liable to judgment."7
2055 When someone asks him, "Which commandment in the Law is
the greatest?"8 Jesus replies: "You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your mind. This is the
greatest and first commandment. and a second is like it: You shall love
your neighbor as yourself. On these
two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets."9 The
Decalogue must be interpreted in light of
this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law:


the commandments: "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill,
You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment,
are summed up in this sentence: "You shall love your neighbor as
yourself." Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law.10
The Decalogue in Sacred Scripture
2056 The word "Decalogue" means literally "ten words."11 God
revealed these "ten words" to his people
on the holy mountain. They were written "with the finger of God,"12
unlike the other commandments
written by Moses.13 They are pre-eminently the words of God. They
are handed on to us in the books of
Exodus 14 and Deuteronomy.15 Beginning with the Old Testament,
the sacred books refer to the "ten
words,"16 but it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their full
meaning will be revealed.
2057 The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the
Exodus, God's great liberating event at
the center of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative
commandments, prohibitions, or as
positive precepts such as: "Honor your father and mother," the "ten
words" point out the conditions of a life
freed from the slavery of sin. the Decalogue is a path of life:
If you love the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by
keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, then
you shall live andmultiply.17
This liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the
commandment about the
sabbath rest, directed also to foreigners and slaves:
You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and
the LORD your God brought you out thence with a mighty hand and
an outstretched arm.18
2058 The "ten words" sum up and proclaim God's law: "These words
the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst
of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he
added no more. and he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave
them to me."19 For this reason these two tables are called "the
Testimony." In fact, they contain the terms of the covenant concluded
between God and his people. These "tables of the Testimony" were to
be deposited in "the ark."20
2059 The "ten words" are pronounced by God in the midst of a
theophany (“The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain,
out of the midst of the fire."21). They belong to God's revelation of
himself and his glory. the gift of the Commandments is the gift of God
himself and his holy will. In making his will known, God reveals
himself to his people.
2060 The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of the
covenant God sealed with his own. In Exodus, the revelation of the
"ten words" is granted between the proposal of the covenant 22 and its
conclusion - after the people had committed themselves to "do" all that
the Lord had said, and to "obey" it.23 The Decalogue is never handed
on without first recalling the covenant (“The LORD our God made
a covenant with us in Horeb.").24
2061 The Commandments take on their full meaning within the
covenant. According to Scripture, man's
moral life has all its meaning in and through the covenant. the first of
the "ten words" recalls that God loved
his people first:
Since there was a passing from the paradise of freedom to the slavery
of this world, in punishment for sin, the first phrase of the Decalogue,
the first word of God's commandments, bears on freedom "I am the
LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of slavery."25
2062 The Commandments properly so-called come in the second
place: they express the implications of
belonging to God through the establishment of the covenant. Moral
existence is a response to the Lord's
loving initiative. It is the acknowledgement and homage given to God
and a worship of thanksgiving. It is
cooperation with the plan God pursues in history.
2063 The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also
attested to by the fact that all the obligations
are stated in the first person (“I am the Lord.") and addressed by God
to another personal subject (“you"). In
all God's commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates
the recipient. God makes his will known
to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes it known to
the whole people:
The Lord prescribed love towards God and taught justice towards
neighbor, so that man would be neither unjust, nor unworthy of God.
Thus, through the Decalogue, God prepared man to become his friend
and to live in harmony with his neighbor.... the words of the Decalogue
remain likewise for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they have
received amplification and development from the fact of the coming of
the Lord in the flesh.26
The Decalogue in the Church's Tradition


2064 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example of
Jesus, the tradition of the Church has
acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the
Decalogue.
2065 Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied
a predominant place in the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the
faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of expressing the
commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to
memorize and in positive form. They are still in use today. the
catechisms of the Church have often expounded Christian morality by
following the order of the Ten Commandments.
2066 The division and numbering of the Commandments have varied
in the course of history. the present catechism follows the division of
the Commandments established by St. Augustine, which has become
traditional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran
confessions. the Greek Fathers worked out a slightly different division,
which is found in the Orthodox Churches and Reformed communities.
2067 The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love of
God and love of neighbor. the first three concern love of God, and the
other seven love of neighbor.
As charity comprises the two commandments to which the Lord
related the whole Law and the prophets . . . so the Ten
Commandments were themselves given on two tablets. Three were
written on one tablet and seven on the other.27
2068 The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are
obligatory for Christians and that the
justified man is still bound to keep them;28 The Second Vatican
Council confirms: "The bishops, successors
of the apostles, receive from the Lord . . . the mission of teaching all
peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to
every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith,
Baptism and the observance of the
Commandments."29
The unity of the Decalogue
2069 The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each "word" refers to
each of the others and to all of them; they
reciprocally condition one another. the two tables shed light on one
another; they form an organic unity.
To transgress one commandment is to infringe all the others.30 One
cannot honor another person without
blessing God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all
men, his creatures. the Decalogue brings
man's religious and social life into unity.
The Decalogue ant the natural law
2070 The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same
time they teach us the true humanity
of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore,
indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent
in the nature of the human person. the Decalogue contains a privileged
expression of the natural law:
From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the
precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of
them. This was the Decalogue.31
2071 The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to
reason alone, have been revealed. To
attain a complete and certain understanding of the requirements of the
natural law, sinful humanity needed
this revelation:
A full explanation of the commandments of the Decalogue became
necessary in the state of sin because the light of reason was obscured
and the will had gone astray.32
We know God's commandments through the
divine revelation proposed to us in the Church, and through the voice
of moral conscience. the obligation
of the Decalogue
2072 Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and
towards his neighbor, the Ten
Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations.
They are fundamentally immutable,
and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from
them. the Ten Commandments are
engraved by God in the human heart.
2073 Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations in
matter which is, in itself, light. Thus
abusive language is forbidden by the fifth commandment, but would
be a grave offense only as a result of
circumstances or the offender's intention. "Apart from me you can do
nothing"
2074 Jesus says: "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in
me, and I in him, he it is that bears
much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."33 The fruit
referred to in this saying is the holiness of
a life made fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe in Jesus
Christ, partake of his mysteries, and keep
his commandments, the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father
and his brethren, our Father and our
brethren. His person becomes, through the Spirit, the living and
interior rule of our activity. "This is my
commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."34

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS




IN BRIEF
2075 "What good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" - "If you would
enter into life, keep the
commandments" (Mt 19:16-17).
2076 By his life and by his preaching Jesus attested to the permanent
validity of the Decalogue. 2077 The
gift of the Decalogue is bestowed from within the covenant concluded
by God with his people. God's
commandments take on their true meaning in and through this
covenant.
2078 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with Jesus' example, the
tradition of the Church has always
acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the
Decalogue.
2079 The Decalogue forms an organic unity in which each "word" or
"commandment" refers to all the others
taken together. To transgress one commandment is to infringe the
whole Law (cf Jas 2:10-11).
2080 The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural
law. It is made known to us by divine
revelation and by human reason.
2081 The Ten Commandments, in their fundamental content, state
grave obligations. However, obedience
to these precepts also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself,
light.
2082 What God commands he makes possible by his grace.

2083 Jesus summed up man's duties toward God in this saying: "You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your mind."1 This immediately echoes the solemn call:
"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD."2
God has loved us first. the love of the One God is recalled in the first
of the "ten words." the commandments then make explicit the
response of love that man is called to give to his God.

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT




I. "You Shall Worship the Lord Your God and Him Only Shall You
Serve"
2084 God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful loving,
and liberating action in the history of the one he addresses: "I brought
you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." the first
word contains the first commandment of the Law: "You shall fear the
LORD your God; you shall serve him.... You shall not go after other
gods."5 God's first call and just demand is that man accept him and
worship him.
2085 The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel.6 The
revelation of the vocation and truth of man is linked to the revelation
of God. Man's vocation is to make God manifest by acting in
conformity with his creation "in the image and likeness of God":
There will never be another God, Trypho, and there has been no other
since the world began . . . than he who made and ordered the universe.
We do not think that our God is different from yours. He is the same
who brought your fathers out of Egypt "by his powerful hand and his
outstretched arm." We do not place our hope in some other god, for
there is none, but in the same God as you do: the God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.7
2086 "The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity.
When we say 'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always
the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that we must
necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and
acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely
beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who could not love
him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has
poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at
the beginning and end of his commandments: 'I am the LORD.'"8
Faith
2087 Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love
to us. St. Paul speaks of the "obedience of faith"9 as our first
obligation. He shows that "ignorance of God" is the principle and
explanation of all moral deviations.10 Our duty toward God is to
believe in him and to bear witness to him.
2088 The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our
faith with prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is
opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against faith:
Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true
what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. Involuntary
doubt refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming
objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its
obscurity. If deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual
blindness.
2089 Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to
assent to it. "Heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some
truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or it is
likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same; apostasy is the total
repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission
to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with the members of the
Church subject to him."11
Hope
2090 When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully
respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that God
will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in
conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident
expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God; it is also
the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment.
2091 The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope,
namely, despair and presumption:
By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God,
for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is
contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to
his promises - and to his mercy.
2092 There are two kinds of presumption. Either man presumes upon
his own capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without help
from on high), or he presumes upon God's almighty power or his
mercy (hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion and glory
without merit).
Charity
2093 Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation to
respond with sincere love to divine charity. the first commandment
enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures for him and
because of him.12
2094 One can sin against God's love in various ways:
- indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to
consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power.
- ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to
return him love for love.
- lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love;
it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity.
- acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes
from God and to be repelled by divine goodness.
- hatred of God comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose
goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who
forbids sins and inflicts punishments.

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT




II. "Him Only Shall You Serve"
2095 The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity inform and
give life to the moral virtues. Thus charity leads us to render to God
what we as creatures owe him in all justice. the virtue of religion
disposes us to have this attitude.
Adoration
2096 Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore God is
to acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Savior, the Lord and
Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful Love. "You
shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve," says
Jesus, citing Deuteronomy.13
2097 To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute
submission, the "nothingness of the creature" who would not exist but
for God. To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble
oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude that
he has done great things and holy is his name.14 The worship of the
one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the slavery of
sin and the idolatry of the world.
Prayer
2098 The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first
commandment are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind toward
God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of praise and
thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable
condition for being able to obey God's commandments. " (We) ought
always to pray and not lose heart."15
Sacrifice
2099 It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and
gratitude, supplication and communion: "Every action done so as to
cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve blessedness,
is a true sacrifice."16
2100 Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of
spiritual sacrifice: "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken
spirit...."17 The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced
sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of
neighbor.18 Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: "I desire
mercy, and not sacrifice."19 The only perfect sacrifice is the one that
Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father's love and
for our salvation.20 By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we can make
our lives a sacrifice to God.
Promises and vows
2101 In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises
to God. Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders
always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may
also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that
pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of
the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God.
2102 "A vow is a deliberate and free promise made to God concerning
a possible and better good which must be fulfilled by reason of the
virtue of religion,"21 A vow is an act of devotion in which the
Christian dedicates himself to God or promises him some good work.
By fulfilling his vows he renders to God what has been promised and
consecrated to Him. the Acts of the Apostles shows us St. Paul
concerned to fulfill the vows he had made.22
2103 The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to
practice the evangelical counsels:23
Mother Church rejoices that she has within herself many men and
women who pursue the Savior's self-emptying more closely and show it
forth more clearly, by undertaking poverty with the freedom of the
children of God, and renouncing their own will: they submit
themselves to man for the sake of God, thus going beyond what is of
precept in the matter of perfection, so as to conform themselves more
fully to the obedient Christ.24
The Church can, in certain cases and for proportionate reasons,
dispense from vows and promises25
The social duty of religion and the right to religious freedom
2104 "All men are bound to seek the truth, especially in what concerns
God and his Church, and to embrace it and hold on to it as they come
to know it."26 This duty derives from "the very dignity of the human
person."27 It does not contradict a "sincere respect" for different
religions which frequently "reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens
all men,"28 nor the requirement of charity, which urges Christians "to
treat with love, prudence and patience those who are in error or
ignorance with regard to the faith."29
2105 The duty of offering God genuine worship concerns man both
individually and socially. This is "the traditional Catholic teaching on
the moral duty of individuals and societies toward the true religion and
the one Church of Christ."30 By constantly evangelizing men, the
Church works toward enabling them "to infuse the Christian spirit into
the mentality and mores, laws and structures of the communities in
which [they] live."31 The social duty of Christians is to respect and
awaken in each man the love of the true and the good. It requires them
to make known the worship of the one true religion which subsists in
the Catholic and apostolic Church.32 Christians are called to be the
light of the world. Thus, the Church shows forth the kingship of Christ
over all creation and in particular over human societies.33
2106 "Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor is
anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience
in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in association with
others, within due limits."34 This right is based on the very nature of
the human person, whose dignity enables him freely to assent to the
divine truth which transcends the temporal order. For this reason it
"continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation
of seeking the truth and adhering to it."35
2107 "If because of the circumstances of a particular people special
civil recognition is given to one religious community in the
constitutional organization of a state, the right of all citizens and
religious communities to religious freedom must be recognized and
respected as well."36
2108 The right to religious liberty is neither a moral license to adhere
to error, nor a supposed right to error,37 but rather a natural right of
the human person to civil liberty, i.e., immunity, within just limits,
from external constraint in religious matters by political authorities.
This natural right ought to be acknowledged in the juridical order of
society in such a way that it constitutes a civil right.38
2109 The right to religious liberty can of itself be neither unlimited nor
limited only by a "public order" conceived in a positivist or naturalist
manner.39 The "due limits" which are inherent in it must be
determined for each social situation by political prudence, according to
the requirements of the common good, and ratified by the civil
authority in accordance with "legal principles which are in conformity
with the objective moral order."40

SECTION TWO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS




CHAPTER ONE YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND
WITH ALL YOUR MIND




Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
III. "You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me"
2110 The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the
one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes
superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a
perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to
the virtue of religion.
Superstition
2111 Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the
practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer
the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way
magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute
the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external
performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is
to fall into superstition.41
Idolatry
2112 The first commandment condemns polytheism. It requires man
neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the one true
God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols, (of) silver and
gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak;
eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make their worshippers
empty: "Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in
them."42 God, however, is the "living God"43 who gives life and
intervenes in history.
2113 Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a
constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not
God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature
in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example,
satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus
says, "You cannot serve God and mammon."44 Many martyrs died for
not adoring "the Beast"45 refusing even to simulate such worship.
Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore
incompatible with communion with God.46
2114 Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God. the
commandment to worship the Lord alone integrates man and saves
him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion of man's
innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who "transfers his
indestructible notion of God to anything other than God."47
Divination and magic
2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still,
a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into
the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving
up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can
constitute a lack of responsibility.
2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or
demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to
"unveil" the future.48 Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading,
interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and
recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history,
and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to
conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and
loving fear that we owe to God alone.
2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame
occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a
supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of
restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion.
These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied
by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to
the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible.
Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for
her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional
cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the
exploitation of another's credulity.
Irreligion
2118 God's first commandment condemns the main sins of irreligion:
tempting God, in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony.
2119 Tempting God consists in putting his goodness and almighty
power to the test by word or deed. Thus Satan tried to induce Jesus to
throw himself down from the Temple and, by this gesture, force God to
act.49 Jesus opposed Satan with the word of God: "You shall not put
the LORD your God to the test." 50 The challenge contained in such
tempting of God wounds the respect and trust we owe our Creator and
Lord. It always harbors doubt about his love, his providence, and his
power.51
2120 Sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the
sacraments and other liturgical actions, as well as persons, things, or
places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially when
committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the true Body of
Christ is made substantially present for us.52
2121 Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things.53
To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw
at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: "Your silver perish with
you, because you thought you could obtain God's gift with money!"54
Peter thus held to the words of Jesus: "You received without pay, give
without pay."55 It is impossible to appropriate to oneself spiritual
goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they have
their source in God. One can receive them only from him, without
payment.
2122 The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the
sacraments beyond the offerings defined by the competent authority,
always being careful that the needy are not deprived of the help of the
sacraments because of their poverty."56 The competent authority
determines these "offerings" in accordance with the principle that the
Christian people ought to contribute to the support of the Church's
ministers. "The laborer deserves his food."57
Atheism
2123 "Many . . . of our contemporaries either do not at all perceive, or
explicitly reject, this intimate and vital bond of man to God. Atheism
must therefore be regarded as one of the most serious problems of our
time."58
2124 The name "atheism" covers many very different phenomena. One
common form is the practical materialism which restricts its needs and
aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism falsely considers
man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme
control, of his own history."59 Another form of contemporary atheism
looks for the liberation of man through economic and social liberation.
"It holds that religion, of its very nature, thwarts such emancipation by
raising man's hopes in a future life, thus both deceiving him and
discouraging him from working for a better form of life on earth."60
2125 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin
against the virtue of religion.61 The imputability of this offense can be
significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the
circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise
of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction
in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious,
moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal
the true nature of God and of religion."62
2126 Atheism is often based on a false conception of human
autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence on
God.63 Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity of
man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in
God...."64 "For the Church knows full well that her message is in
harmony with the most secret desires of the human heart."65
Agnosticism
2127 Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases the
agnostic refrains from denying God; instead he postulates the existence
of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing itself, and
about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the agnostic makes no
judgment about God's existence, declaring it impossible to prove, or
even to affirm or deny.
2128 Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for God, but
it can equally express indifferentism, a flight from the ultimate
question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience. Agnosticism is
all too often equivalent to practical atheism.

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT




IV. "You Shall Not Make For Yourself a Graven Image . . ."
2129 The divine injunction included the prohibition of every
representation of God by the hand of man. Deuteronomy explains:
"Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at
Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by
making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure...."66
It is the absolutely transcendent God who revealed himself to Israel.
"He is the all," but at the same time "he is greater than all his
works."67 He is "the author of beauty."68
2130 Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained or
permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically toward
salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze serpent, the
ark of the covenant, and the cherubim.69
2131 Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word, the seventh
ecumenical council at Nicaea (787) justified against the iconoclasts the
veneration of icons - of Christ, but also of the Mother of God, the
angels, and all the saints. By becoming incarnate, the Son of God
introduced a new "economy" of images.
2132 The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first
commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor rendered to
an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates an image
venerates the person portrayed in it."70 The honor paid to sacred
images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration due to God
alone:
Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves, considered
as mere things, but under their distinctive aspect as images leading us
on to God incarnate. the movement toward the image does not
terminate in it as image, but tends toward that whose image it is.71

Article 1 THE FIRST COMMANDMENT




IN BRIEF
2133 "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
all your soul and with all your strength" (Deut 6:5).
2134 The first commandment summons man to believe in God, to
hope in him, and to love him above all else.
2135 "You shall worship the Lord your God" (? Mt 4:10). Adoring
God, praying to him, offering him the worship that belongs to him,
fulfilling the promises and vows made to him are acts of the virtue of
religion which fall under obedience to the first commandment.
2136 The duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as
an individual and as a social being.
2137 "Men of the present day want to profess their religion freely in
private and in public" (DH 15).
2138 Superstition is a departure from the worship that we give to the
true God. It is manifested in idolatry, as well as in various forms of
divination and magic.
2139 Tempting God in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony are sins
of irreligion forbidden by the first commandment.
2140 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin
against the first commandment.
2141 The veneration of sacred images is based on the mystery of the
Incarnation of the Word of God. It is not contrary to the first
commandment.

I. The Name of the Lord is Holy
2142 The second commandment prescribes respect for the Lord's
name. Like the first commandment, it belongs to the virtue of religion
and more particularly it governs our use of speech in sacred matters.
2143 Among all the words of Revelation, there is one which is unique:
the revealed name of God. God confides his name to those who believe
in him; he reveals himself to them in his personal mystery. the gift of a
name belongs to the order of trust and intimacy. "The Lord's name is
holy." For this reason man must not abuse it. He must keep it in mind
in silent, loving adoration. He will not introduce it into his own speech
except to bless, praise, and glorify it.74
2144 Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the
mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes. the
sense of the sacred is part of the virtue of religion:
Are these feelings of fear and awe Christian feelings or not? . . . I say
this, then, which I think no one can reasonably dispute. They are the
class of feelings we should have - yes, have to an intense degree - if we
literally had the sight of Almighty God; therefore they are the class of
feelings which we shall have, if we realize His presence. In proportion
as we believe that He is present, we shall have them; and not to have
them, is not to realize, not to believe that He is present.75
2145 The faithful should bear witness to the Lord's name by
confessing the faith without giving way to fear.76 Preaching and
catechizing should be permeated with adoration and respect for the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2146 The second commandment forbids the abuse of God's name, i.e.,
every improper use of the names of God, Jesus Christ, but also of the
Virgin Mary and all the saints.
2147 Promises made to others in God's name engage the divine honor,
fidelity, truthfulness, and authority. They must be respected in justice.
To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God's name and in some way to
make God out to be a liar.77
2148 Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second commandment. It
consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly - words of
hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in failing in
respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's name. St. James
condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by
which you are called."78 The prohibition of blasphemy extends to
language against Christ's Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is
also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal
practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put
them to death. the misuse of God's name to commit a crime can
provoke others to repudiate religion.
Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name. It is
in itself a grave sin.79
2149 Oaths which misuse God's name, though without the intention of
blasphemy, show lack of respect for the Lord. the second
commandment also forbids magical use of the divine name.
[God's] name is great when spoken with respect for the greatness of his
majesty. God's name is holy when said with veneration and fear of
offending him.80

II. Taking the Name of the Lord in Vain
2150 The second commandment forbids false oaths. Taking an oath or
swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke
the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own truthfulness. An oath
engages the Lord's name. "You shall fear the LORD your God; you
shall serve him, and swear by his name."81
2151 Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and
Lord, God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord
with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful
and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of human speech
with God's truth. A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie.
2152 A person commits perjury when he makes a promise under oath
with no intention of keeping it, or when after promising on oath he
does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the Lord of all
speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed is contrary to
the holiness of the divine name.
2153 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second
commandment: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old,
'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you
have sworn.' But I say to you, Do not swear at all.... Let what you say
be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil
one."82 Jesus teaches that every oath involves a reference to God and
that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech.
Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of
his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.
2154 Following St. Paul,83 The tradition of the Church has
understood Jesus' words as not excluding oaths made for grave and
right reasons (for example, in court). "An oath, that is the invocation of
the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless in truth,
in judgment, and in justice."84
2155 The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither use it
for trivial matters, nor take an oath which on the basis of the
circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority unjustly
requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil authorities, it
may be refused. It must be refused when it is required for purposes
contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial communion.

III. The Christian Name
2156 The sacrament of Baptism is conferred "in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."85 In Baptism, the
Lord's name sanctifies man, and the Christian receives his name in the
Church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple who has
lived a life of exemplary fidelity to the Lord. the patron saint provides a
model of charity; we are assured of his intercession. the "baptismal
name" can also express a Christian mystery or Christian virtue.
"Parents, sponsors, and the pastor are to see that a name is not given
which is foreign to Christian sentiment."86
2157 The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with
the Sign of the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit. Amen." the baptized person dedicates the day to the
glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which lets him act in the
Spirit as a child of the Father. the sign of the cross strengthens us in
temptations and difficulties.
2158 God calls each one by name.87 Everyone's name is sacred. the
name is the icon of the person. It demands respect as a sign of the
dignity of the one who bears it.
2159 The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the kingdom, the
mysterious and unique character of each person marked with God's
name will shine forth in splendor. "To him who conquers . . . I will give
a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one
knows except him who receives it."88 "Then I looked, and Lo, on
Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a hundred and forty-four
thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their
foreheads."89

IN BRIEF
2160 "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth"
(Ps 8:1)!
2161 The second commandment enjoins respect for the Lord's name.
the name of the Lord is holy.
2162 The second commandment forbids every improper use of God's
name. Blasphemy is the use of the name of God, of Jesus Christ, of the
Virgin Mary, and of the saints in an offensive way.
2163 False oaths call on God to be witness to a lie. Perjury is a grave
offence against the Lord who is always faithful to his promises.
2164 "Do not swear whether by the Creator, or any creature, except
truthfully, of necessity, and with reverence" (St. Ignatius of Loyola,
Spiritual Exercises, 38).
2165 In Baptism, the Christian receives his name in the Church.
Parents, godparents, and the pastor are to see that he be given a
Christian name. the patron saint provides a model of charity and the
assurance of his prayer.
2166 The Christian begins his prayers and activities with the Sign of
the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit. Amen."
2167 God calls each one by name (cf Isa 43:1).

Article 3 THE THIRD COMMANDMENT
I. The Sabbath Day
2168 The third commandment of the Decalogue recalls the holiness of
the sabbath: "The seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the
LORD."92
2169 In speaking of the sabbath Scripture recalls creation: "For in six
days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in
them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the
sabbath day and hallowed it."93
2170 Scripture also reveals in the Lord's day a memorial of Israel's
liberation from bondage in Egypt: "You shall remember that you were a
servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out
thence with mighty hand and outstretched arm; therefore the LORD
your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day."94
2171 God entrusted the sabbath to Israel to keep as a sign of the
irrevocable covenant.95 The sabbath is for the Lord, holy and set apart
for the praise of God, his work of creation, and his saving actions on
behalf of Israel.
2172 God's action is the model for human action. If God "rested and
was refreshed" on the seventh day, man too ought to "rest" and should
let others, especially the poor, "be refreshed."96 The sabbath brings
everyday work to a halt and provides a respite. It is a day of protest
against the servitude of work and the worship of money.97
2173 The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of
violating the sabbath law. But Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of
this day.98 He gives this law its authentic and authoritative
interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the
sabbath."99 With compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing
good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.100 The
sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God.101
"The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath."102

II. The Lord's Day
This is the day which the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad
in it.103


The day of the Resurrection: the new creation
2174 Jesus rose from the dead "on the first day of the week."104
Because it is the "first day," the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the
first creation. Because it is the "eighth day" following the sabbath,105
it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For
Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the
Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday:
We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the
Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter
from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our
Savior rose from the dead.106
Sunday - fulfillment of the sabbath
2175 Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it
follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial
observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday
fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's
eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for the
mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some aspects of
Christ:107
Those who lived according to the old order of things have come to a
new hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but the Lord's Day, in which
our life is blessed by him and by his death.108
2176 The celebration of Sunday observes the moral commandment
inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward,
visible, public, and regular worship "as a sign of his universal
beneficence to all."109 Sunday worship fulfills the moral command of
the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly
celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people.
The Sunday Eucharist
2177 The Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at
the heart of the Church's life.
"Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light
of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy
day of obligation in the universal Church."110
"Also to be observed are the day of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus
Christ,
the Epiphany,
the Ascension of Christ,
the feast of the Body and Blood of Christi,
the feast of Mary the Mother of God,
her Immaculate Conception,
her Assumption,
the feast of Saint Joseph,
the feast of the Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All
Saints."111
2178 This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the beginnings
of the apostolic age.112 The Letter to the Hebrews reminds the
faithful "not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some, but to
encourage one another."113
Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhortation: Come
to Church early, approach the Lord, and confess your sins, repent in
prayer.... Be present at the sacred and divine liturgy, conclude its
prayer and do not leave before the dismissal.... We have often said:
"This day is given to you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the
Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it."114
2179 "A parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful
established on a stable basis within a particular church; the pastoral
care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under
the authority of the diocesan bishop."115 It is the place where all the
faithful can be gathered together for the Sunday celebration of the
Eucharist. the parish initiates the Christian people into the ordinary
expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together in this
celebration; it teaches Christ's saving doctrine; it practices the charity
of the Lord in good works and brotherly love:
You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great
multitude, where exclamations are cried out to God as from one great
heart, and where there is something more: the union of minds, the
accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayers of the priests.116
The Sunday obligation
2180 The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more
precisely: "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful
are bound to participate in the Mass."117 "The precept of
participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is
celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the
evening of the preceding day."118
2181 The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all
Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to
participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a
serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by
their own pastor.119 Those who deliberately fail in this obligation
commit a grave sin.
2182 Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday
Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ
and to his Church. the faithful give witness by this to their communion
in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness and their
hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the guidance of
the Holy Spirit.
2183 "If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause
participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is
specially recommended that the faithful take part in the Liturgy of the
Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place
according to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in
prayer for an appropriate amount of time personally or in a family or,
as occasion offers, in groups of families."120
A day of grace and rest from work
2184 Just as God "rested on the seventh day from all his work which
he had done,"121 human life has a rhythm of work and rest. the
institution of the Lord's Day helps everyone enjoy adequate rest and
leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.122
2185 On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to
refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship
owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, the performance of the
works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.123
Family needs or important social service can legitimately excuse from
the obligation of Sunday rest. the faithful should see to it that
legitimate excuses do not lead to habits prejudicial to religion, family
life, and health.
The charity of truth seeks holy leisure - the necessity of charity accepts
just work.124
2186 Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of their
brethren who have the same needs and the same rights, yet cannot rest
from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is traditionally
consecrated by Christian piety to good works and humble service of
the sick, the infirm, and the elderly. Christians will also sanctify
Sunday by devoting time and care to their families and relatives, often
difficult to do on other days of the week. Sunday is a time for
reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which
furthers the growth of the Christian interior life.
2187 Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort.
Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others
that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day. Traditional
activities (sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public
services, etc.), require some people to work on Sundays, but everyone
should still take care to set aside sufficient time for leisure. With
temperance and charity the faithful will see to it that they avoid the
excesses and violence sometimes associated with popular leisure
activities. In spite of economic constraints, public authorities should
ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine worship. Employers
have a similar obligation toward their employees.
2188 In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all,
Christians should seek recognition of Sundays and the Church's holy
days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public example of
prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as a precious
contribution to the spiritual life of society. If a country's legislation or
other reasons require work on Sunday, the day should nevertheless be
lived as the day of our deliverance which lets us share in this "festal
gathering," this "assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in
heaven."125

IN BRIEF
2189 "Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Deut 5:12). "The
seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord" (Ex 31:15).
2190 The sabbath, which represented the completion of the first
creation, has been replaced by Sunday which recalls the new creation
inaugurated by the Resurrection of Christ.
2191 The Church celebrates the day of Christ's Resurrection on the
"eighth day," Sunday, which is rightly called the Lord's Day (cf SC
106).
2192 "Sunday . . . is to be observed as the foremost holy day of
obligation in the universal Church" (CIC, can. 1246 # 1). "On
Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to
participate in the Mass" (CIC, can. 1247).
2193 "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are
bound . . . to abstain from those labors and business concerns which
impede the worship to be rendered to God, the joy which is proper to
the Lord's Day, or the proper relaxation of mind and body" (CIC, can.

2194 The institution of Sunday helps all "to be allowed sufficient rest
and leisure to cultivate their amilial, cultural, social, and religious lives"
(GS 67 # 3).

CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS
YOURSELF
Jesus said to his disciples: "Love one another even as I have loved
you."1
2196 In response to the question about the first of the
commandments, Jesus says: "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel: the Lord our
God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all
your strength.' the second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."2
The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: "He who loves his neighbor has
fulfilled the law. the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery,
You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other
commandment, are summed up in this sentence, 'You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love
is the fulfilling of the law."3

ARTICLE 4 THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the
land which the Lord your God gives you.4
He was obedient to them.5
The Lord Jesus himself recalled the force of this "commandment of
God."6 The Apostle teaches: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother,' (This is the first
commandment with a promise.) 'that it may be well with you and that
you may live long on the earth."'7
2197 The fourth commandment opens the second table of the
Decalogue. It shows us the order of charity. God has willed that, after
him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and who have
handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged to honor and
respect all those whom God, for our good, has vested with his
authority.
2198 This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be
fulfilled. It introduces the subsequent commandments which are
concerned with particular respect for life, marriage, earthly goods, and
speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of the social doctrine of
the Church.
2199 The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to children in
their relationship to their father and mother, because this relationship
is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of kinship between
members of the extended family. It requires honor, affection, and
gratitude toward elders and ancestors. Finally, it extends to the duties
of pupils to teachers, employees to employers, subordinates to leaders,
citizens to their country, and to those who administer or govern it. This
commandment includes and presupposes the duties of parents,
instructors, teachers, leaders, magistrates, those who govern, all who
exercise authority over others or over a community of persons.
2200 Observing the fourth commandment brings its reward: "Honor
your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land
which the LORD your God gives you."8 Respecting this
commandment provides, along with spiritual fruits, temporal fruits of
peace and prosperity. Conversely, failure to observe it brings great
harm to communities and to individuals.

I. The Family in God's Plan
The nature of the family
2201 The conjugal community is established upon the consent of the
spouses. Marriage and the family are ordered to the good of the
spouses and to the procreation and education of children. the love of
the spouses and the begetting of children create among members of
the same family personal relationships and primordial responsibilities.
2202 A man and a woman united in marriage, together with their
children, form a family. This institution is prior to any recognition by
public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It should be
considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of
family relationship are to be evaluated.
2203 In creating man and woman, God instituted the human family
and endowed it with its fundamental constitution. Its members are
persons equal in dignity. For the common good of its members and of
society, the family necessarily has manifold responsibilities, rights, and
duties.
The Christian family
2204 "The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and
realization of ecclesial communion, and for this reason it can and
should be called a domestic church."9 It is a community of faith, hope,
and charity; it assumes singular importance in the Church, as is
evident in the New Testament.10
2205 The Christian family is a communion of persons, a sign and
image of the communion of the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit.
In the procreation and education of children it reflects the Father's
work of creation. It is called to partake of the prayer and sacrifice of
Christ. Daily prayer and the reading of the Word of God strengthen it
in charity. the Christian family has an evangelizing and missionary
task.
2206 The relationships within the family bring an affinity of feelings,
affections and interests, arising above all from the members' respect for
one another. the family is a privileged community called to achieve a
"sharing of thought and common deliberation by the spouses as well as
their eager cooperation as parents in the children's upbringing."11

II. The Family and Society
2207 The family is the original cell of social life. It is the natural society
in which husband and wife are called to give themselves in love and in
the gift of life. Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the
family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity
within society. the family is the community in which, from childhood,
one can learn moral values, begin to honor God, and make good use of
freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society.
2208 The family should live in such a way that its members learn to
care and take responsibility for the young, the old, the sick, the
handicapped, and the poor. There are many families who are at times
incapable of providing this help. It devolves then on other persons,
other families, and, in a subsidiary way, society to provide for their
needs: "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father
is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep
oneself unstained from the world."12
2209 The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social
measures. Where families cannot fulfill their responsibilities, other
social bodies have the duty of helping them and of supporting the
institution of the family. Following the principle of subsidiarity, larger
communities should take care not to usurp the family's prerogatives or
interfere in its life.
2210 The importance of the family for the life and well-being of
society13 entails a particular responsibility for society to support and
strengthen marriage and the family. Civil authority should consider it a
grave duty "to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family,
to protect and foster them, to safeguard public morality, and promote
domestic prosperity."14
2211 The political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist
it, and to ensure especially:
- the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in
keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;
- the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution
of the family;
- the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on, and raise one's
children in it, with the necessary means and institutions;
- the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and
housing, and the right to emigrate;
- in keeping with the country's institutions, the right to medical care,
assistance for the aged, and family benefits;
- the protection of security and health, especially with respect to
dangers like drugs, pornography, alcoholism, etc.;
- the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have
representation before civil authority.15
2212 The fourth commandment illuminates other relationships in
society. In our brothers and sisters we see the children of our parents;
in our cousins, the descendants of our ancestors; in our fellow citizens,
the children of our country; in the baptized, the children of our mother
the Church; in every human person, a son or daughter of the One who
wants to be called "our Father." In this way our relationships with our
neighbors are recognized as personal in character. the neighbor is not a
"unit" in the human collective; he is "someone" who by his known
origins deserves particular attention and respect.
2213 Human communities are made up of persons. Governing them
well is not limited to guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties such as
honoring contracts. Right relations between employers and employees,
between those who govern and citizens, presuppose a natural good will
in keeping with the dignity of human persons concerned for justice and
fraternity.

III. The Duties of Family Members
The duties of children
2214 The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood;16 this
is the foundation of the honor owed to parents. the respect of children,
whether minors or adults, for their father and mother17 is nourished
by the natural affection born of the bond uniting them. It is required
by God's commandment.18
2215 Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward
those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought
their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature,
wisdom, and grace. "With all your heart honor your father, and do not
forget the birth pangs of your mother. Remember that through your
parents you were born; what can you give back to them that equals
their gift to you?"19
2216 Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. "My son,
keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's
teaching.... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they
will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you."20
"A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen
to rebuke."21
2217 As long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should
obey his parents in all that they ask of him when it is for his good or
that of the family. "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this
pleases the Lord."22 Children should also obey the reasonable
directions of their teachers and all to whom their parents have
entrusted them. But if a child is convinced in conscience that it would
be morally wrong to obey a particular order, he must not do so.
As they grow up, children should continue to respect their parents.
They should anticipate their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and
accept their just admonitions. Obedience toward parents ceases with
the emancipation of the children; not so respect, which is always owed
to them. This respect has its roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of
the Holy Spirit.
2218 The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their
responsibilities toward their parents. As much as they can, they must
give them material and moral support in old age and in times of illness,
loneliness, or distress. Jesus recalls this duty of gratitude.23
For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he confirmed
the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever honors his father atones
for sins, and whoever glorifies his mother is like one who lays up
treasure. Whoever honors his father will be gladdened by his own
children, and when he prays he will be heard. Whoever glorifies his
father will have long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his
mother.24
O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as long as
he lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; in all
your strength do not despise him.... Whoever forsakes his father is like
a blasphemer, and whoever angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.25
2219 Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also
concerns relationships between brothers and sisters. Respect toward
parents fills the home with light and warmth. "Grandchildren are the
crown of the aged."26 "With all humility and meekness, with patience,
[support] one another in charity."27
2220 For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom
they have received the gift of faith, the grace of Baptism, and life in the
Church. These may include parents, grandparents, other members of
the family, pastors, catechists, and other teachers or friends. "I am
reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your
grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells
in you."28
The duties of parents
2221 The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the
procreation of children, but must extend to their moral education and
their spiritual formation. "The role of parents in education is of such
importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate
substitute."29 The right and the duty of parents to educate their
children are primordial and inalienable.30
2222 Parents must regard their children as children of God and
respect them as human persons. Showing themselves obedient to the
will of the Father in heaven, they educate their children to fulfill God's
law.
2223 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their
children. They bear witness to this responsibility first by creating a
home where tenderness, forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and disinterested
service are the rule. the home is well suited for education in the virtues.
This requires an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and
self-mastery - the preconditions of all true freedom. Parents should
teach their children to subordinate the "material and instinctual
dimensions to interior and spiritual ones."31 Parents have a grave
responsibility to give good example to their children. By knowing how
to acknowledge their own failings to their children, parents will be
better able to guide and correct them:
He who loves his son will not spare the rod.... He who disciplines his
son will profit by him.32
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in
the discipline and instruction of the Lord.33
2224 The home is the natural environment for initiating a human
being into solidarity and communal responsibilities. Parents should
teach children to avoid the compromising and degrading influences
which threaten human societies.
2225 Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive
the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents
should initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the
faith of which they are the "first heralds" for their children. They
should associate them from their tenderest years with the life of the
Church.34 A wholesome family life can foster interior dispositions that
are a genuine preparation for a living faith and remain a support for it
throughout one's life.
2226 Education in the faith by the parents should begin in the child's
earliest years. This already happens when family members help one
another to grow in faith by the witness of a Christian life in keeping
with the Gospel. Family catechesis precedes, accompanies, and
enriches other forms of instruction in the faith. Parents have the
mission of teaching their children to pray and to discover their vocation
as children of God.35 The parish is the Eucharistic community and the
heart of the liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place
for the catechesis of children and parents.
2227 Children in turn contribute to the growth in holiness of their
parents.36 Each and everyone should be generous and tireless in
forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and neglect.
Mutual affection suggests this. the charity of Christ demands it.37
2228 Parents' respect and affection are expressed by the care and
attention they devote to bringing up their young children and
providing for their physical and spiritual needs. As the children grow
up, the same respect and devotion lead parents to educate them in the
right use of their reason and freedom.
2229 As those first responsible for the education of their children,
parents have the right to choose a school for them which corresponds
to their own convictions. This right is fundamental. As far as possible
parents have the duty of choosing schools that will best help them in
their task as Christian educators.38 Public authorities have the duty of
guaranteeing this parental right and of ensuring the concrete
conditions for its exercise.
2230 When they become adults, children have the right and duty to
choose their profession and state of life. They should assume their new
responsibilities within a trusting relationship with their parents,
willingly asking and receiving their advice and counsel. Parents should
be careful not to exert pressure on their children either in the choice of
a profession or in that of a spouse. This necessary restraint does not
prevent them - quite the contrary from giving their children judicious
advice, particularly when they are planning to start a family.
2231 Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or
brothers and sisters, to give themselves more completely to a
profession, or to serve other honorable ends. They can contribute
greatly to the good of the human family.

IV. The Family and the Kingdom
2232 Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child
grows to maturity and human and spiritual autonomy, so his unique
vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly and
forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their children
to follow it. They must be convinced that the first vocation of the
Christian is to follow Jesus: "He who loves father or mother more than
me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than
me is not worthy of me."39
2233 Becoming a disciple of Jesus means accepting the invitation to
belong to God's family, to live in conformity with His way of life: "For
whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister,
and mother."40
Parents should welcome and respect with joy and thanksgiving the
Lord's call to one of their children to follow him in virginity for the
sake of the Kingdom in the consecrated life or in priestly ministry.

V. The Authorities In Civil Society
2234 God's fourth commandment also enjoins us to honor all who for
our good have received authority in society from God. It clarifies the
duties of those who exercise authority as well as those who benefit
from it.
Duties of civil authorities
2235 Those who exercise authority should do so as a service. "Whoever
would be great among you must be your servant."41 The exercise of
authority is measured morally in terms of its divine origin, its
reasonable nature and its specific object. No one can command or
establish what is contrary to the dignity of persons and the natural law.
2236 The exercise of authority is meant to give outward expression to a
just hierarchy of values in order to facilitate the exercise of freedom
and responsibility by all. Those in authority should practice distributive
justice wisely, taking account of the needs and contribution of each,
with a view to harmony and peace. They should take care that the
regulations and measures they adopt are not a source of temptation by
setting personal interest against that of the community.42
2237 Political authorities are obliged to respect the fundamental rights
of the human person. They will dispense justice humanely by
respecting the rights of everyone, especially of families and the
disadvantaged.
The political rights attached to citizenship can and should be granted
according to the requirements of the common good. They cannot be
suspended by public authorities without legitimate and proportionate
reasons. Political rights are meant to be exercised for the common
good of the nation and the human community.
The duties of citizens
2238 Those subject to authority should regard those in authority as
representatives of God, who has made them stewards of his gifts:43
"Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution.... Live as
free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live
as servants of God."44 Their loyal collaboration includes the right, and
at times the duty, to voice their just criticisms of that which seems
harmful to the dignity of persons and to the good of the community.
2239 It is the duty of citizens to contribute along with the civil
authorities to the good of society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidarity,
and freedom. the love and service of one's country follow from the
duty of gratitude and belong to the order of charity. Submission to
legitimate authorities and service of the common good require citizens
to fulfill their roles in the life of the political community.
2240 Submission to authority and co-responsibility for the common
good make it morally obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the right to
vote, and to defend one's country:
Pay to all of them their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to
whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom
honor is due.45


[Christians] reside in their own nations, but as resident aliens. They
participate in all things as citizens and endure all things as foreigners....
They obey the established laws and their way of life surpasses the
laws.... So noble is the position to which God has assigned them that
they are not allowed to desert it.46
The Apostle exhorts us to offer prayers and thanksgiving for kings and
all who exercise authority, "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life,
godly and respectful in every way."47
2241 The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are
able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means
of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. Public
authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that
places a guest under the protection of those who receive him.
Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they
are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate
subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the
immigrants' duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are
obliged to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of
the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying
civic burdens.
2242 The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of
civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral
order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the
Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their demands
are contrary to those of an upright conscience, finds its justification in
the distinction between serving God and serving the political
community. "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and to God the things that are God's."48 "We must obey God rather
than men":49
When citizens are under the oppression of a public authority which
oversteps its competence, they should still not refuse to give or to do
what is objectively demanded of them by the common good; but it is
legitimate for them to defend their own rights and those of their fellow
citizens against the abuse of this authority within the limits of the
natural law and the Law of the Gospel.50
2243 Armed resistance to oppression by political authority is not
legitimate, unless all the following conditions are met: 1) there is
certain, grave, and prolonged violation of fundamental rights; 2) all
other means of redress have been exhausted; 3) such resistance will not
provoke worse disorders; 4) there is well-founded hope of success; and
5) it is impossible reasonably to foresee any better solution.
The political community and the Church
2244 Every institution is inspired, at least implicitly, by a vision of man
and his destiny, from which it derives the point of reference for its
judgment, its hierarchy of values, its line of conduct. Most societies
have formed their institutions in the recognition of a certain
preeminence of man over things. Only the divinely revealed religion
has clearly recognized man's origin and destiny in God, the Creator
and Redeemer. the Church invites political authorities to measure their
judgments and decisions against this inspired truth about God and
man:
Societies not recognizing this vision or rejecting it in the name of their
independence from God are brought to seek their criteria and goal in
themselves or to borrow them from some ideology. Since they do not
admit that one can defend an objective criterion of good and evil, they
arrogate to themselves an explicit or implicit totalitarian power over
man and his destiny, as history shows.51
2245 The Church, because of her commission and competence, is not
to be confused in any way with the political community. She is both
the sign and the safeguard of the transcendent character of the human
person. "The Church respects and encourages the political freedom
and responsibility of the citizen."52
2246 It is a part of the Church's mission "to pass moral judgments
even in matters related to politics, whenever the fundamental rights of
man or the salvation of souls requires it. the means, the only means,
she may use are those which are in accord with the Gospel and the
welfare of all men according to the diversity of times and
circumstances."53

IN BRIEF
2247 "Honor your father and your mother" (Deut 5:16; Mk 7:10).
2248 According to the fourth commandment, God has willed that,
after him, we should honor our parents and those whom he has vested
with authority for our good.
2249 The conjugal community is established upon the covenant and
consent of the spouses. Marriage and family are ordered to the good of
the spouses, to the procreation and the education of children.
2250 "The well-being of the individual person and of both human and
Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal
and family life" (GS 47 # 1).
2251 Children owe their parents respect, gratitude, just obedience, and
assistance. Filial respect fosters harmony in all of family life.
2252 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their
children in the faith, prayer, and all the virtues. They have the duty to
provide as far as possible for the physical and spiritual needs of their
children.
2253 Parents should respect and encourage their children's vocations.
They should remember and teach that the first calling of the Christian
is to follow Jesus.
2254 Public authority is obliged to respect the fundamental rights of
the human person and the conditions for the exercise of his freedom.
2255 It is the duty of citizens to work with civil authority for building
up society in a spirit of truth, justice, solidarity, and freedom.
2256 Citizens are obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of
civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral
order. "We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).
2257 Every society's judgments and conduct reflect a vision of man
and his destiny. Without the light the Gospel sheds on God and man,
societies easily become totalitarian.

Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT




I. Respect for Human Life
The witness of sacred history
2259 In the account of Abel's murder by his brother Cain,57 Scripture
reveals the presence of anger and envy in man, consequences of
original sin, from the beginning of human history. Man has become
the enemy of his fellow man. God declares the wickedness of this
fratricide: "What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood is
crying to me from the ground. and now you are cursed from the
ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood
from your hand."58
2260 The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with
reminders of God's gift of human life and man's murderous violence:
For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning.... Whoever sheds
the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man
in his own image.59
The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign of life.60
This teaching remains necessary for all time.
2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth
commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous."61 The
deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the
dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of
the Creator. the law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each
and everyone, always and everywhere.
2262 In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the
commandment, "You shall not kill,"62 and adds to it the proscription
of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his
disciples to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies.63 He did not
defend himself and told Peter to leave his sword in its sheath.64
Legitimate defense
2263 The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an
exception to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that
constitutes intentional killing. "The act of self-defense can have a
double effect: the preservation of one's own life; and the killing of the
aggressor.... the one is intended, the other is not."65
2264 Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality.
Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one's own right to life.
Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is
forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow:
If a man in self-defense uses more than necessary violence, it will be
unlawful: whereas if he repels force with moderation, his defense will
be lawful.... Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of
moderate self-defense to avoid killing the other man, since one is
bound to take more care of one's own life than of another's.
2265 Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for
one who is responsible for the lives of others life. The defense of the
common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to
cause harm. For this reason , those who legitimately hold authority
also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil
community entrusted to their responsibility.66
Capital Punishment
2266 The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to
people's rights and to the basic rules of civil society correspond to the
requirement of safeguarding the common good. Legitimate public
authority has the right and the duty to inflict punishment
proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Punishment has the
primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense.
When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of
expiation. Punishment then, in addition to defending public order and
protecting people's safety, has a medicinal purpose: it must contribute
to the correction of the guilty party.67
2267 Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have
been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does nor
exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of
effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.
If, however non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect
people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such
means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of
the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the
human person.
Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has
for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed
an offence incapable of doing harm - without definitively taking away
from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the
execution of the offender is an absolute necessity 'are very rare, if not
practically non-existent.' party.67B
Intentional homicide
2268 The fifth commandment forbids direct and intentional killing as
gravely sinful. the murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in
murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance.68
Infanticide,69 fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse are
especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they
break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any
murder, even if commanded by public authority.
2269 The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the
intention of indirectly bringing about a person's death. the moral law
prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave reason, as
well as refusing assistance to a person in danger.
The acceptance by human society of murderous famines, without
efforts to remedy them, is a scandalous injustice and a grave offense.
Those whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the hunger and
death of their brethren in the human family indirectly commit
homicide, which is imputable to them.70
Unintentional killing is not morally imputable. But one is not
exonerated from grave offense if, without proportionate reasons, he has
acted in a way that brings about someone's death, even without the
intention to do so.
Abortion
2270 Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the
moment of conception.
From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be
recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the
inviolable right of every innocent being to life.71
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were
born I consecrated you.72
My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret,
intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.73
2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of
every procured abortion.
This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.
Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a
means, is gravely contrary to the moral law:
You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the
newborn to perish.74
God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of
safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of
themselves.
Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of
conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.75
2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense.
The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this
crime against human life.
"A person who procures a completed abortion incurs
excommunication latae sententiae,"76 "by the very commission of the
offense,"77 and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law.78
The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy.
Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the
irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as
to the parents and the whole of society.
2273 The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is
a constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation:
"The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected
by civil society and the political authority.
These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on
parents; nor do they represent a concession made by society and the
state; they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by
virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin.
Among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard
every human being's right to life and physical integrity from the
moment of conception until death."79


"The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of
the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them, the state is
denying the equality of all before the law.
When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of
each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very
foundations of a state based on law are undermined....
As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be ensured
for the unborn child from the moment of conception, the law must
provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the
child's rights."80
2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo
must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as
possible, like any other human being.
Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of
the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe
guarding or healing as an individual....
It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the
thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results:
a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."81
2275 "One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human
embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not
involve disproportionate risks for it, but are directed toward its healing
the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual
survival."82
"It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as
disposable biological material."83
"Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are
not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected
according to sex or other predetermined qualities.
Such manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human
being and his integrity and identity"84 which are unique and
unrepeatable.
Euthanasia
2276 Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special
respect. Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to lead lives as
normal as possible.
2277 Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia consists in
putting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying persons.
It is morally unacceptable.
Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death
in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to
the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living
God, his Creator.
The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not
change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be
forbidden and excluded.
2278 Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome,
dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome
can be legitimate; it is the refusal of "over-zealous" treatment.
Here one does not will to cause death; one's inability to impede it is
merely accepted.
The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and
able or, if not, by those legally entitled to act for the patient, whose
reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be respected.
2279 Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a
sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted.
The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at
the risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with
human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means, but
only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable
Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity.
As such it should be encouraged.
Suicide
2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to
him.
It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life.
We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor
and the salvation of our souls.
We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us.
It is not ours to dispose of.
2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to
preserve and perpetuate his life.
It is gravely contrary to the just love of self.
It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties
of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which
we continue to have obligations.
Suicide is contrary to love for the living God.
2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example,
especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal.
Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law.
Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship,
suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one
committing suicide.
2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who
have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can
provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. the Church prays for
persons who have taken their own lives.

CHAPTER TWO YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS
YOURSELF
Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT




II. Respect for the Dignity of Persons
Respect for the souls of others: scandal
2284 Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil.
the person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He
damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into
spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission
another is deliberately led into a grave offense.
2285 Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of
those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It
prompted our Lord to utter this curse: "Whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a
great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the
depth of the sea."85 Scandal is grave when given by those who by
nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus
reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to
wolves in sheep's clothing.86
2286 Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or
opinion.


Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social
structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of
religious practice, or to "social conditions that, intentionally or not,
make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments
difficult and practically impossible."87 This is also true of business
leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their
children to anger,88 or manipulators of public opinion who turn it
away from moral values.
2287 Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it
leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for
the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. "Temptations to
sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come!"89
Respect for health
2288 Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by
God.
We must take reasonable care of them, taking into account the needs of
others and the common good.
Concern for the health of its citizens requires that society help in the
attainment of living-conditions that allow them to grow and reach
maturity: food and clothing, housing, health care, basic education,
employment, and social assistance.
2289 If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not
make it an absolute value.
It rejects a neo-pagan notion that tends to promote the cult of the
body, to sacrifice everything for it's sake, to idolize physical perfection
and success at sports.
By its selective preference of the strong over the weak, such a
conception can lead to the perversion of human relationships.
2290 The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of
excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur
grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own
and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air.
2291 The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human health and
life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave
offense. Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs are
scandalous practices. They constitute direct co-operation in evil, since
they encourage people to practices gravely contrary to the moral law.
Respect for the person and scientific research
2292 Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human
individuals or groups can contribute to healing the sick and the
advancement of public health.
2293 Basic cientific research, as well as applied research, is a
significant expression of man's dominion over creation. Science and
technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man
and promote his integral development for the benefit of all. By
themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and
of human progress. Science and technology are ordered to man, from
whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the
person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and
awareness of their limits.
2294 It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research
and its applications. On the other hand, guiding principles cannot be
inferred from simple technical efficiency, or from the usefulness
accruing to some at the expense of others or, even worse, from
prevailing ideologies. Science and technology by their very nature
require unconditional respect for fundamental moral criteria. They
must be at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, of
his true and integral good, in conformity with the plan and the will of
God.
2295 Research or experimentation on the human being cannot
legitimate acts that are in themselves contrary to the dignity of persons
and to the moral law. the subjects' potential consent does not justify
such acts. Experimentation on human beings is not morally legitimate
if it exposes the subject's life or physical and psychological integrity to
disproportionate or avoidable risks. Experimentation on human beings
does not conform to the dignity of the person if it takes place without
the informed consent of the subject or those who legitimately speak for
him.
2296 Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the
physical and psychological dangers and risks to the donor are
proportionate to the good sought for the recipient. Organs donation
after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as an
expression of generous solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the
donor or his proxy has have not given explicit consent.
Moreover, it is not morally admissible directly to bring about the
disabling mutilation or death of a human being, even in order to delay
the death of other persons.
Respect for bodily integrity
2297 Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror; by
means of threats they subject their victims to intolerable pressures.
They are morally wrong. Terrorism threatens, wounds, and kills
indiscriminately; it is gravely against justice and charity. Torture which
uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the
guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for
the person and for human dignity. Except when performed for strictly
therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations,
mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons are
against the moral law.90
2298 In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate
governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the
Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals
the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as
these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and
mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become
evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public
order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human
person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more
degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for
the victims and their tormentors.
Respect for the dead
2299 The dying should be given attention and care to help them live
their last moments in dignity and peace. They will be helped by the
prayer of their relatives, who must see to it that the sick receive at the
proper time the sacraments that prepare them to meet the living God.
2300 The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity,
in faith and hope of the Resurrection. the burial of the dead is a
corporal work of mercy;91 it honors the children of God, who are
temples of the Holy Spirit.
2301 Autopsies can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific
research. the free gift of organs after death is legitimate and can be
meritorious.
The Church permits cremation, provided that it does not demonstrate
a denial of faith in the resurrection of the body.92

Article 5 THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT
III. Safeguarding Peace
Peace
2302 By recalling the commandment, "You shall not kill,"93 our Lord
asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and hatred
as immoral.
Anger is a desire for revenge. "To desire vengeance in order to do evil
to someone who should be punished is illicit," but it is praiseworthy to
impose restitution "to correct vices and maintain justice."94 If anger
reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a
neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin. the Lord says,
"Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to
judgment."95
2303 Deliberate hatred is contrary to charity. Hatred of the neighbor is
a sin when one deliberately wishes him evil. Hatred of the neighbor is a
grave sin when one deliberately desires him grave harm. "But I say to
you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that
you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven."96
2304 Respect for and development of human life require peace. Peace
is not merely the absence of war, and it is not limited to maintaining a
balance of powers between adversaries. Peace cannot be attained on
earth without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication
among men, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the
assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is "the tranquillity of order."97
Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity.98
2305 Earthly peace is the image and fruit of the peace of Christ, the
messianic "Prince of Peace."99 By the blood of his Cross, "in his wn
person he killed the hostility,"100 he reconciled men with God and
made his Church the sacrament of the unity of the human race and of
its union with God. "He is our peace."101 He has declared: "Blessed
are the peacemakers."102
2306 Those who renounce violence and bloodshed and, in order to
safeguard human rights, make use of those means of defense available
to the weakest, bear witness to evangelical charity, provided they do so
without harming the rights and obligations of other men and societies.
They bear legitimate witness to the gravity of the physical and moral
risks of recourse to violence, with all its destruction and death.103
Avoiding war
2307 The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of
human life. Because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war,
the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that
the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war.104
2308 All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the
avoidance of war.
However, "as long as the danger of war persists and there is no
international authority with the necessary competence and power,
governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, once all
peace efforts have failed."105
2309 The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force
require rigorous consideration. the gravity of such a decision makes it
subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same
time:
- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of
nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be
impractical or ineffective;
- there must be serious prospects of success;
- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the
evil to be eliminated. the power of modem means of destruction weighs
very heavily in evaluating this condition.
These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the
"just war" doctrine.
The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the
prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common
good.
2310 Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose
on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense.
Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are
servants of the security and freedom of nations. If they carry out their
duty honorably, they truly contribute to the common good of the
nation and the maintenance of peace.106
2311 Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who
for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms; these are nonetheless
obliged to serve the human community in some other way.107
2312 The Church and human reason both assert the permanent
validity of the moral law during armed conflict. "The mere fact that
war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything becomes
licit between the warring parties."108
2313 Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be
respected and treated humanely.
Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal
principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions.
Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out.
Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be
condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that
command genocide.
2314 "Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of
whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God
and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation."109 A
danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those
who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic, biological, or
chemical weapons - to commit such crimes.
2315 The accumulation of arms strikes many as a paradoxically
suitable way of deterring potential adversaries from war. They see it as
the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations. This
method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations. the arms
race does not ensure peace. Far from eliminating the causes of war, it
risks aggravating them. Spending enormous sums to produce ever new
types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy populations;110 it
thwarts the development of peoples. Over-armament multiplies
reasons for conflict and increases the danger of escalation.
2316 The production and the sale of arms affect the common good of
nations and of the international community. Hence public authorities
have the right and duty to regulate them. the short-term pursuit of
private or collective interests cannot legitimate undertakings that
promote violence and conflict among nations and compromise the
international juridical order.
2317 Injustice, excessive economic or social inequalities, envy, distrust,
and pride raging among men and nations constantly threaten peace
and cause wars. Everything done to overcome these disorders
contributes to building up peace and avoiding war:
Insofar as men are sinners, the threat of war hangs over them and will
so continue until Christ comes again; but insofar as they can vanquish
sin by coming together in charity, violence itself will be vanquished and
these words will be fulfilled: "they shall beat their swords into
plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."111

IN BRIEF
2318 "In [God's] hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of
all mankind" (Job 12:10).
2319 Every human life, from the moment of conception until death, is
sacred because the human person has been willed for its own sake in
the image and likeness of the living and holy God.
2320 The murder of a human being is gravely contrary to the dignity
of the person and the holiness of the Creator.
2321 The prohibition of murder does not abrogate the right to render
an unjust aggressor unable to inflict harm. Legitimate defense is a
grave duty for whoever is responsible for the lives of others or the
common good.
2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct
abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a
"criminal" practice (GS 27 # 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. the
Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this
crime against human life.
2323 Because it should be treated as a person from conception, the
embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed like
every other human being.
2324 Intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder.
It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the
respect due to the living God, his Creator.
2325 Suicide is seriously contrary to justice, hope, and charity. It is
forbidden by the fifth commandment.
2326 Scandal is a grave offense when by deed or omission it
deliberately leads others to sin gravely.
2327 Because of the evils and injustices that all war brings with it, we
must do everything reasonably possible to avoid it. the Church prays:
"From famine, pestilence, and war, O Lord, deliver us."
2328 The Church and human reason assert the permanent validity of
the moral law during armed conflicts. Practices deliberately contrary to
the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes.
2329 "The arms race is one of the greatest curses on the human race
and the harm it inflicts on the poor is more than can be endured" (GS
81 # 3).
2330 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of
God" (Mt 5:9).

I. "Male and Female He Created Them . . ."
2331 "God is love and in himself he lives a mystery of personal loving
communion. Creating the human race in his own image . . .. God
inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the vocation, and thus
the capacity and responsibility, of love and communion."114
"God created man in his own image . . . male and female he created
them";115 He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply";116
"When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male
and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them
Man when they were created."117
2332 Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of
his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love
and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming
bonds of communion with others.
2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his
sexual identity. Physical, moral, and spiritual difference and
complementarity are oriented toward the goods of marriage and the
flourishing of family life. the harmony of the couple and of society
depends in part on the way in which the complementarity, needs, and
mutual support between the sexes are lived out.
2334 "In creating men 'male and female,' God gives man and woman
an equal personal dignity."118 "Man is a person, man and woman
equally so, since both were created in the image and likeness of the
personal God."119
2335 Each of the two sexes is an image of the power and tenderness of
God, with equal dignity though in a different way. the union of man
and woman in marriage is a way of imitating in the flesh the Creator's
generosity and fecundity: "Therefore a man leaves his father and his
mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh."120 All
human generations proceed from this union.121
2336 Jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins. In the
Sermon on the Mount, he interprets God's plan strictly: "You have
heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you
that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed
adultery with her in his heart."122 What God has joined together, let
not man put asunder.123
The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment
as encompassing the whole of human sexuality.

II. The Vocation to Chastity
2337 Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the
person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual
being. Sexuality, in which man's belonging to the bodily and biological
world is expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is
integrated into the relationship of one person to another, in the
complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a woman.
The virtue of chastity therefore involves the integrity of the person and
the integrality of the gift.
The integrity of the person
2338 The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life
and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the person;
it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It tolerates neither a
double life nor duplicity in speech.124


2339 Chastity includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery which is a
training in human freedom. the alternative is clear: either man governs
his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be dominated by them
and becomes unhappy.125 "Man's dignity therefore requires him to act
out of conscious and free choice, as moved and drawn in a personal
way from within, and not by blind impulses in himself or by mere
external constraint. Man gains such dignity when, ridding himself of all
slavery to the passions, he presses forward to his goal by freely
choosing what is good and, by his diligence and skill, effectively secures
for himself the means suited to this end."126
2340 Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal promises and
resist temptations will want to adopt the means for doing so: self-
knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations that
confront him, obedience to God's commandments, exercise of the
moral virtues, and fidelity to prayer. "Indeed it is through chastity that
we are gathered together and led back to the unity from which we were
fragmented into multiplicity."127
2341 The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of
temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the
senses with reason.
2342 Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never consider
it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all stages
of life.128 The effort required can be more intense in certain periods,
such as when the personality is being formed during childhood and
adolescence.
2343 Chastity has laws of growth which progress through stages
marked by imperfection and too often by sin. "Man . . . day by day
builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows,
loves, and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth."129
2344 Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also involves a
cultural effort, for there is "an interdependence between personal
betterment and the improvement of society."130 Chastity presupposes
respect for the rights of the person, in particular the right to receive
information and an education that respect the moral and spiritual
dimensions of human life.
2345 Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, a grace, a
fruit of spiritual effort.131 The Holy Spirit enables one whom the
water of Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of Christ.132
The integrality of the gift of self
2346 Charity is the form of all the virtues. Under its influence, chastity
appears as a school of the gift of the person. Self-mastery is ordered to
the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to become a witness
to his neighbor of God's fidelity and loving kindness.
2347 The virtue of chastity blossoms in friendship. It shows the
disciple how to follow and imitate him who has chosen us as his
friends,133 who has given himself totally to us and allows us to
participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality.
Chastity is expressed notably in friendship with one's neighbor.
Whether it develops between persons of the same or opposite sex,
friendship represents a great good for all. It leads to spiritual
communion.
The various forms of chastity
2348 All the baptized are called to chastity. the Christian has "put on
Christ,"134 The model for all chastity. All Christ's faithful are called to
lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states of life. At the
moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to lead his affective
life in chastity.
2349 "People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited to
their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy which
enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart
in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the
moral law, whether they are married or single."135 Married people are
called to live conjugal chastity; others practice chastity in continence:
There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is that of
spouses, the second that of widows, and the third that of virgins. We do
not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others.... This is
what makes for the richness of the discipline of the Church.136
2350 Those who are engaged to marry are called to live chastity in
continence. They should see in this time of testing a discovery of
mutual respect, an apprenticeship in fidelity, and the hope of receiving
one another from God. They should reserve for marriage the
expressions of affection that belong to married love. They will help
each other grow in chastity.
Offenses against chastity
2351 Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual
pleasure. Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself,
isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes.
2352 By masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of
the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. "Both the
Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and
the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly
maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered
action."137 "The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever
reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose." For
here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which
is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of
mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is
achieved."138
To form an equitable judgment about the subjects' moral responsibility
and to guide pastoral action, one must take into account the affective
immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety, or other
psychological or social factors that lessen if not even reduce to a
minimum, moral culpability.
2353 Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an
unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and
of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses
and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave
scandal when there is corruption of the young.
2354 Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts
from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately
to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the
conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave
injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public),
since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for
others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy
world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the
production and distribution of pornographic materials.
2355 Prostitution does injury to the dignity of the person who engages
in it, reducing the person to an instrument of sexual pleasure. the one
who pays sins gravely against himself: he violates the chastity to which
his Baptism pledged him and defiles his body, the temple of the Holy
Spirit.139 Prostitution is a social scourge. It usually involves women,
but also men, children, and adolescents (The latter two cases involve
the added sin of scandal.). While it is always gravely sinful to engage in
prostitution, the imputability of the offense can be attenuated by
destitution, blackmail, or social pressure.
2356 Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another
person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the
respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which every
person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for
life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of
children committed by parents (incest) or those responsible for the
education of the children entrusted to them.
Chastity and homosexuality
2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between
women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction
toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms
through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological
genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture,
which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,140 tradition
has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically
disordered."141 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the
sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine
affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can
they be approved.
2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated
homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is
objectively disordered, constitutes for must of them a trial. They must
be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of
unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons
are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to
unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may
encounter from their condition.
2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-
mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of
disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and
should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.

III. The Love of Husband and Wife
2360 Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In
marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and
pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized
persons are sanctified by the sacrament.
2361 "Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves
to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to
spouses, is not something simply biological, but concerns the
innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly
human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and
woman commit themselves totally to one another until death."142
Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, "Sister, get up, and let us pray
and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety." So she got
up, and they began to pray and implore that they might be kept safe.
Tobias began by saying, "Blessed are you, O God of our fathers.... You
made Adam, and for him you made his wife Eve as a helper and
support. From the two of them the race of mankind has sprung. You
said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make a helper
for him like himself.' I now am taking this kinswoman of mine, not
because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that she and I may find mercy
and that we may grow old together." and they both said, "Amen,
Amen." Then they went to sleep for the night.143
2362 "The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste union of
the spouses takes place are noble and honorable; the truly human
performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and
enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude."144 Sexuality is a source of
joy and pleasure:
The Creator himself . . . established that in the [generative] function,
spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit.
Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and
enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At
the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the
limits of just moderation.145
2363 The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the
good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two
meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering
the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and
the future of the family.
The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold
obligation of fidelity and fecundity.
Conjugal fidelity
2364 The married couple forms "the intimate partnership of life and
love established by the Creator and governed by his laws; it is rooted in
the conjugal covenant, that is, in their irrevocable personal
consent."146 Both give themselves definitively and totally to one
another. They are no longer two; from now on they form one flesh. the
covenant they freely contracted imposes on the spouses the obligation
to preserve it as unique and indissoluble.147 "What therefore God has
joined together, let not man put asunder."148
2365 Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one's given word. God is
faithful. the Sacrament of Matrimony enables man and woman to
enter into Christ's fidelity for his Church. Through conjugal chastity,
they bear witness to this mystery before the world.


St. John Chrysostom suggests that young husbands should say to their
wives: I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to
my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent
dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of
not being separated in the life reserved for us.... I place your love above
all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to
be of a different mind than you.149
The fecundity of marriage
2366 Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally
tends to be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something
added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very
heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church,
which "is on the side of life"150 teaches that "it is necessary that each
and every marriage act must remain open 'per se' to the procreation of
human life."151 "This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous
occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseparable connection,
established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break,
between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which
are both inherent to the marriage act."152
2367 Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and
fatherhood of God.153 "Married couples should regard it as their
proper mission to transmit human life and to educate their children;
they should realize that they are thereby cooperating with the love of
God the Creator and are, in a certain sense, its interpreters. They will
fulfill this duty with a sense of human and Christian responsibility."154
2368 A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the regulation
of procreation. For just reasons, spouses may wish to space the births
of their children. It is their duty to make certain that their desire is not
motivated by selfishness but is in conformity with the generosity
appropriate to responsible parenthood. Moreover, they should conform
their behavior to the objective criteria of morality:
When it is a question of harmonizing married love with the responsible
transmission of life, the morality of the behavior does not depend on
sincere intention and evaluation of motives alone; but it must be
determined by objective criteria, criteria drawn from the nature of the
person and his acts, criteria that respect the total meaning of mutual
self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love; this is
possible only if the virtue of married chastity is practiced with sincerity
of heart.155
2369 "By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the
procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true
mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted vocation to
parenthood."156
2370 Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation
based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in
conformity with the objective criteria of morality.157 These methods
respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them,
and favor the education of an authentic freedom. In contrast, "every
action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its
accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences,
proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation
impossible" is intrinsically evil:158
Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving
of husband and wife is overlaid, through contraception, by an
objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not giving oneself
totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive refusal to be open
to life but also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love,
which is called upon to give itself in personal totality.... the difference,
both anthropological and moral, between contraception and recourse
to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in the final analysis two
irreconcilable concepts of the human person and of human
sexuality.159
2371 "Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of
transmitting it are not limited by the horizons of this life only: their
true evaluation and full significance can be understood only in
reference to man's eternal destiny."160
2372 The state has a responsibility for its citizens' well-being. In this
capacity it is legitimate for it to intervene to orient the demography of
the population. This can be done by means of objective and respectful
information, but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. The
state may not legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the
primary responsibility for the procreation and education of their
children.161 In this area, it is not authorized to employ means
contrary to the moral law.
The gift of a child
2373 acred Scripture and the Church's traditional practice see in large
families a sign of God's blessing and the parents' generosity.162
2374 Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly. "What
will you give me," asks Abraham of God, "for I continue childless?"163
and Rachel cries to her husband Jacob, "Give me children, or I shall
die!"164
2375 Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged,
on condition that it is placed "at the service of the human person, of
his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good according to the
design and will of God."165
2376 Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by
the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or
ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These techniques
(heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the
child's right to be born of a father and mother known to him and
bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses' "right to
become a father and a mother only through each other."166
2377 Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous
artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible,
yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from
the procreative act. the act which brings the child into existence is no
longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but
one that "entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of
doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology
over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of
domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be
common to parents and children."167 "Under the moral aspect
procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as
the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the
spouses' union .... Only respect for the link between the meanings of
the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make
possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person."168
2378 A child is not something owed to one, but is a gift. the "supreme
gift of marriage" is a human person. A child may not be considered a
piece of property, an idea to which an alleged "right to a child" would
lead. In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right "to
be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents," and
"the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his
conception."169
2379 The Gospel shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil.
Spouses who still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate
medical procedures should unite themselves with the Lord's Cross, the
source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their
generosity by adopting abandoned children or performing demanding
services for others.

IV. Offenses Against the Dignity of Marriage
Adultery
2380 Adultery refers to marital infidelity. When two partners, of whom
at least one is married to another party, have sexual relations - even
transient ones - they commit adultery. Christ condemns even adultery
of mere desire.170 The sixth commandment and the New Testament
forbid adultery absolutely.171 The prophets denounce the gravity of
adultery; they see it as an image of the sin of idolatry.172
2381 Adultery is an injustice. He who commits adultery fails in his
commitment. He does injury to the sign of the covenant which the
marriage bond is, transgresses the rights of the other spouse, and
undermines the institution of marriage by breaking the contract on
which it is based. He compromises the good of human generation and
the welfare of children who need their parents' stable union.
Divorce
2382 The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the Creator
who willed that marriage be indissoluble.173 He abrogates the
accommodations that had slipped into the old Law.174
Between the baptized, "a ratified and consummated marriage cannot
be dissolved by any human power or for any reason other than
death."175
2383 The separation of spouses while maintaining the marriage bond
can be legitimate in certain cases provided for by canon law.176
If civil divorce remains the only possible way of ensuring certain legal
rights, the care of the children, or the protection of inheritance, it can
be tolerated and does not constitute a moral offense.
2384 Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to
break the contract, to which the spouses freely consented, to live with
each other till death. Divorce does injury to the covenant of salvation,
of which sacramental marriage is the sign. Contracting a new union,
even if it is recognized by civil law, adds to the gravity of the rupture:
the remarried spouse is then in a situation of public and permanent
adultery:
If a husband, separated from his wife, approaches another woman, he
is an adulterer because he makes that woman commit adultery, and the
woman who lives with him is an adulteress, because she has drawn
another's husband to herself.177
2385 Divorce is immoral also because it introduces disorder into the
family and into society. This disorder brings grave harm to the deserted
spouse, to children traumatized by the separation of their parents and
often torn between them, and because of its contagious effect which
makes it truly a plague on society.
2386 It can happen that one of the spouses is the innocent victim of a
divorce decreed by civil law; this spouse therefore has not contravened
the moral law. There is a considerable difference between a spouse who
has sincerely tried to be faithful to the sacrament of marriage and is
unjustly abandoned, and one who through his own grave fault destroys
a canonically valid marriage.178
Other offenses against the dignity of marriage
2387 The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the
Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he has
shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However polygamy is
not in accord with the moral law." [Conjugal] communion is radically
contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of
God which was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to
the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give
themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and
exclusive."179 The Christian who has previously lived in polygamy has
a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in regard to
his former wives and his children.
2388 Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws
within a degree that prohibits marriage between them.180 St. Paul
stigmatizes this especially grave offense: "It is actually reported that
there is immorality among you . . . for a man is living with his father's
wife.... In the name of the Lord Jesus ... you are to deliver this man to
Satan for the destruction of the flesh...."181 Incest corrupts family
relationships and marks a regression toward animality.
2389 Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on
children or adolescents entrusted to their care. the offense is
compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and moral
integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and
the violation of responsibility for their upbringing.
2390 In a so-called free union, a man and a woman refuse to give
juridical and public form to a liaison involving sexual intimacy.
The expression "free union" is fallacious: what can "union" mean when
the partners make no commitment to one another, each exhibiting a
lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future?
The expression covers a number of different situations: concubinage,
rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term
commitments.182 All these situations offend against the dignity of
marriage; they destroy the very idea of the family; they weaken the
sense of fidelity. They are contrary to the moral law. the sexual act
must take place exclusively within marriage. Outside of marriage it
always constitutes a grave sin and excludes one from sacramental
communion.
2391 Some today claim a "right to a trial marriage" where there is an
intention of getting married later. However firm the purpose of those
who engage in premature sexual relations may be, "the fact is that such
liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and fidelity in a
relationship between a man and a woman, nor, especially, can they
protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim."183 Carnal union is
morally legitimate only when a definitive community of life between a
man and woman has been established. Human love does not tolerate
"trial marriages." It demands a total and definitive gift of persons to
one another.184

IN BRIEF
2392 "Love is the fundamental and innate vocation of every human
being" (FC 11).
2393 By creating the human being man and woman, God gives
personal dignity equally to the one and the other. Each of them, man
and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity.
2394 Christ is the model of chastity. Every baptized person is called to
lead a chaste life, each according to his particular state of life.
2395 Chastity means the integration of sexuality within the person. It
includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery.
2396 Among the sins gravely contrary to chastity are masturbation,
fornication, pornography, and homosexual practices.
2397 The covenant which spouses have freely entered into entails
faithful love. It imposes on them the obligation to keep their marriage
indissoluble.
2398 Fecundity is a good, a gift and an end of marriage. By giving life,
spouses participate in God's fatherhood.
2399 The regulation of births represents one of the aspects of
responsible fatherhood and motherhood. Legitimate intentions on the
part of the spouses do not justify recourse to morally unacceptable
means (for example, direct sterilization or contraception).
2400 Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave offenses
against the dignity of marriage.

THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT
You shall not steal.185
2401 The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping
the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way with respect
to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care of earthly
goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good,
it requires respect for the universal destination of goods and respect for
the right to private property. Christian life strives to order this world's
goods to God and to fraternal charity.

I. The Universal Destination and the Private Ownership of Goods
2402 In the beginning God entrusted the earth and its resources to the
common stewardship of mankind to take care of them, master them by
labor, and enjoy their fruits.186 The goods of creation are destined for
the whole human race. However, the earth is divided up among men to
assure the security of their lives, endangered by poverty and threatened
by violence. the appropriation of property is legitimate for
guaranteeing the freedom and dignity of persons and for helping each
of them to meet his basic needs and the needs of those in his charge. It
should allow for a natural solidarity to develop between men.
2403 The right to private property, acquired or received in a just way,
does not do away with the original gift of the earth to the whole of
mankind. The universal destination of goods remains primordial, even
if the promotion of the common good requires respect for the right to
private property and its exercise.
2404 "In his use of things man should regard the external goods he
legitimately owns not merely as exclusive to himself but common to
others also, in the sense that they can benefit others as well as
himself."187 The ownership of any property makes its holder a steward
of Providence, with the task of making it fruitful and communicating
its benefits to others, first of all his family.
2405 Goods of production - material or immaterial - such as land,
factories, practical or artistic skills, oblige their possessors to employ
them in ways that will benefit the greatest number. Those who hold
goods for use and consumption should use them with moderation,
reserving the better part for guests, for the sick and the poor.
2406 Political authority has the right and duty to regulate the
legitimate exercise of the right to ownership for the sake of the
common good.188

II. Respect for Persons and Their Goods
2407 In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires the
practice of the virtue of temperance, so as to moderate attachment to
this world's goods; the practice of the virtue of justice, to preserve our
neighbor's rights and render him what is his due; and the practice of
solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule and in keeping with the
generosity of the Lord, who "though he was rich, yet for your sake . . .
became poor so that by his poverty, you might become rich."189
Respect for the goods of others
2408 The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping
another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There is no
theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to reason and
the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and
urgent necessity when the only way to provide for immediate, essential
needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at one's disposal and use
the property of others.190
2409 Even if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law, any form
of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the
seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of
objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by
taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another.191
The following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one
contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain
an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one
influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according
to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common
goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of
checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging
private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires
reparation.
2410 Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed to the
extent that the commitments made in them are morally just. A
significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of
contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of
purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed
to and executed in good faith.
2411 Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates
exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance
with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges
strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and
fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no
other form of justice is possible.
One distinguishes commutative justice from legal justice which
concerns what the citizen owes in fairness to the community, and from
distributive justice which regulates what the community owes its
citizens in proportion to their contributions and needs.
2412 In virtue of commutative justice, reparation for injustice
committed requires the restitution of stolen goods to their owner:
Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: "If I have defrauded anyone of
anything, I restore it fourfold."192 Those who, directly or indirectly,
have taken possession of the goods of another, are obliged to make
restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money, if
the goods have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their
owner would have legitimately obtained from them. Likewise, all who
in some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly
benefited from it - for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or
received the stolen goods - are obliged to make restitution in
proportion to their responsibility and to their share of what was stolen.
2413 Games of chance (card games, etc.) or wagers are not in
themselves contrary to justice. They become morally unacceptable
when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his
needs and those of others. the passion for gambling risks becoming an
enslavement. Unfair wagers and cheating at games constitute grave
matter, unless the damage inflicted is so slight that the one who suffers
it cannot reasonably consider it significant.
2414 The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that for
any reason - selfish or ideological, commercial, or totalitarian - lead to
the enslavement of human beings, to their being bought, sold and
exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal dignity. It
is a sin against the dignity of persons and their fundamental rights to
reduce them by violence to their productive value or to a source of
profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat his Christian slave
"no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, . . .
both in the flesh and in the Lord."193
Respect for the integrity of creation
2415 The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of
creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature
destined for the common good of past, present, and future
humanity.194 Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of
the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives.
Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the
Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of
his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious
respect for the integrity of creation.195
2416 Animals are God's creatures. He surrounds them with his
providential care. By their mere existence they bless him and give him
glory.196 Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the
gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri
treated animals.
2417 God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom he
created in his own image.197 Hence it is legitimate to use animals for
food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man in his work
and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on animals is a
morally acceptable practice, if it remains within reasonable limits and
contributes to caring for or saving human lives.
2418 It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die
needlessly. It is likewise unworthy to spend money on them that should
as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can love animals;
one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons.

III. The Social Doctrine of the Church
2419 "Christian revelation . . . promotes deeper understanding of the
laws of social living."198 The Church receives from the Gospel the full
revelation of the truth about man. When she fulfills her mission of
proclaiming the Gospel, she bears witness to man, in the name of
Christ, to his dignity and his vocation to the communion of persons.
She teaches him the demands of justice and peace in conformity with
divine wisdom.
2420 The Church makes a moral judgment about economic and social
matters, "when the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of
souls requires it."199 In the moral order she bears a mission distinct
from that of political authorities: the Church is concerned with the
temporal aspects of the common good because they are ordered to the
sovereign Good, our ultimate end. She strives to inspire right attitudes
with respect to earthly goods and in socio-economic relationships.
2421 The social doctrine of the Church developed in the nineteenth
century when the Gospel encountered modern industrial society with
its new structures for the production of consumer goods, its new
concept of society, the state and authority, and its new forms of labor
and ownership. the development of the doctrine of the Church on
economic and social matters attests the permanent value of the
Church's teaching at the same time as it attests the true meaning of her
Tradition, always living and active.200
2422 The Church's social teaching comprises a body of doctrine,
which is articulated as the Church interprets events in the course of
history, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the whole
of what has been revealed by Jesus Christ.201 This teaching can be
more easily accepted by men of good will, the more the faithful let
themselves be guided by it.
2423 The Church's social teaching proposes principles for reflection; it
provides criteria for judgment; it gives guidelines for action:
Any system in which social relationships are determined entirely by
economic factors is contrary to the nature of the human person and his
acts.202
2424 A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end
of economic activity is morally unacceptable. the disordered desire for
money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is one of the causes of
the many conflicts which disturb the social order.203
A system that "subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of
groups to the collective organization of production" is contrary to
human dignity.204 Every practice that reduces persons to nothing
more than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money,
and contributes to the spread of atheism. "You cannot serve God and
mammon."205
2425 The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies
associated in modem times with "communism" or "socialism." She has
likewise refused to accept, in the practice of "capitalism," individualism
and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human
labor.206 Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning
perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the
marketplace fails social justice, for "there are many human needs which
cannot be satisfied by the market."207 Reasonable regulation of the
marketplace and economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy
of values and a view to the common good, is to be commended.

IV. Economic Activity and Social Justice
2426 The development of economic activity and growth in production
are meant to provide for the needs of human beings. Economic life is
not meant solely to ultiply goods produced and increase profit or
power; it is ordered first of all to the service of persons, of the whole
man, and of the entire human community. Economic activity,
conducted according to its own proper methods, is to be exercised
within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social justice so as
to correspond to God's plan for man.208
2427 Human work proceeds directly from persons created in the
image of God and called to prolong the work of creation by subduing
the earth, both with and for one another.209 Hence work is a duty: "If
any one will not work, let him not eat."210 Work honors the Creator's
gifts and the talents received from him. It can also be redemptive. By
enduring the hardship of work211 in union with Jesus, the carpenter of
Nazareth and the one crucified on Calvary, man collaborates in a
certain fashion with the Son of God in his redemptive work. He shows
himself to be a disciple of Christ by carrying the cross, daily, in the
work he is called to accomplish.212 Work can be a means of
sanctification and a way of animating earthly realities with the Spirit of
Christ.
2428 In work, the person exercises and fulfills in part the potential
inscribed in his nature. the primordial value of labor stems from man
himself, its author and its beneficiary. Work is for man, not man for
work.213
Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of providing for
his life and that of his family, and of serving the human community.
2429 Everyone has the right of economic initiative; everyone should
make legitimate use of his talents to contribute to the abundance that
will benefit all and to harvest the just fruits of his labor. He should seek
to observe regulations issued by legitimate authority for the sake of the
common good.214
2430 Economic life brings into play different interests, often opposed
to one another. This explains why the conflicts that characterize it
arise.215 Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts by
negotiation that respects the rights and duties of each social partner:
those responsible for business enterprises, representatives of wage -
earners (for example, trade unions), and public authorities when
appropriate.
2431 The responsibility of the state. "Economic activity, especially the
activity of a market economy, cannot be conducted in an institutional,
juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it presupposes sure
guarantees of individual freedom and private property, as well as a
stable currency and efficient public services. Hence the principal task
of the state is to guarantee this security, so that those who work and
produce can enjoy the fruits of their labors and thus feel encouraged to
work efficiently and honestly.... Another task of the state is that of
overseeing and directing the exercise of human rights in the economic
sector. However, primary responsibility in this area belongs not to the
state but to individuals and to the various groups and associations
which make up society."216
2432 Those responsible for business enterprises are responsible to
society for the economic and ecological effects of their operations.217
They have an obligation to consider the good of persons and not only
the increase of profits. Profits are necessary, however. They make
possible the investments that ensure the future of a business and they
guarantee employment.
2433 Access to employment and to professions must be open to all
without unjust discrimination: men and women, healthy and disabled,
natives and immigrants.218 For its part society should, according to
circumstances, help citizens find work and employment.219
2434 A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold
it can be a grave injustice.220 In determining fair pay both the needs
and the contributions of each person must be taken into account.
"Remuneration for work should guarantee man the opportunity to
provide a dignified livelihood for himself and his family on the
material, social, cultural and spiritual level, taking into account the role
and the productivity of each, the state of the business, and the
common good."221 Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to
justify morally the amount to be received in wages.
2435 Recourse to a strike is morally legitimate when it cannot be
avoided, or at least when it is necessary to obtain a proportionate
benefit. It becomes morally unacceptable when accompanied by
violence, or when objectives are included that are not directly linked to
working conditions or are contrary to the common good.
2436 Unemployment almost always wounds its victim's dignity and
threatens the equilibrium of his life. Besides the harm done to him
personally, it entails many risks for his family.222

V. Justice and Solidarity Among Nations
2437 On the international level, inequality of resources and economic
capability is such that it creates a real "gap" between nations.223 On
the one side there are those nations possessing and developing the
means of growth and, on the other, those accumulating debts.
2438 Various causes of a religious, political, economic, and financial
nature today give "the social question a worldwide dimension."224
There must be solidarity among nations which are already politically
interdependent. It is even more essential when it is a question of
dismantling the "perverse mechanisms" that impede the development
of the less advanced countries.225 In place of abusive if not usurious
financial systems, iniquitous commercial relations among nations, and
the arms race, there must be substituted a common effort to mobilize
resources toward objectives of moral, cultural, and economic
development, "redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values."226
2439 Rich nations have a grave moral responsibility toward those
which are unable to ensure the means of their development by
themselves or have been prevented from doing so by tragic historical
events. It is a duty in solidarity and charity; it is also an obligation in
justice if the prosperity of the rich nations has come from resources
that have not been paid for fairly.
2440 Direct aid is an appropriate response to immediate, extraordinary
needs caused by natural catastrophes, epidemics, and the like. But it
does not suffice to repair the grave damage resulting from destitution
or to provide a lasting solution to a country's needs. It is also necessary
to reform international economic and financial institutions so that they
will better promote equitable relationships with less advanced
countries.227 The efforts of poor countries working for growth and
liberation must be supported.228 This doctrine must be applied
especially in the area of agricultural labor. Peasants, especially in the
Third World, form the overwhelming majority of the poor.
2441 An increased sense of God and increased self-awareness are
fundamental to any full development of human society. This
development multiplies material goods and puts them at the service of
the person and his freedom. It reduces dire poverty and economic
exploitation. It makes for growth in respect for cultural identities and
openness to the transcendent.229
2442 It is not the role of the Pastors of the Church to intervene
directly in the political structuring and organization of social life. This
task is part of the vocation of the lay faithful, acting on their own
initiative with their fellow citizens. Social action can assume various
concrete forms. It should always have the common good in view and
be in conformity with the message of the Gospel and the teaching of
the Church. It is the role of the laity "to animate temporal realities with
Christian commitment, by which they show that they are witnesses and
agents of peace and justice."230

VI. Love For the Poor
2443 God blesses those who come to the aid of the poor and rebukes
those who turn away from them: "Give to him who begs from you, do
not refuse him who would borrow from you"; "you received without
pay, give without pay."231 It is by what they have done for the poor
that Jesus Christ will recognize his chosen ones.232 When "the poor
have the good news preached to them," it is the sign of Christ's
presence.233
2444 "The Church's love for the poor . . . is a part of her constant
tradition." This love is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of the
poverty of Jesus, and of his concern for the poor.234 Love for the poor
is even one of the motives for the duty of working so as to "be able to
give to those in need."235 It extends not only to material poverty but
also to the many forms of cultural and religious poverty.236
2445 Love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of riches
or their selfish use:
Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming
upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against
you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the
last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields,
which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters
have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth
in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of
slaughter. You have condemned, you have killed the righteous man; he
does not resist you.237
2446 St. John Chrysostom vigorously recalls this: "Not to enable the
poor to share in our goods is to steal from them and deprive them of
life. the goods we possess are not ours, but theirs."238 "The demands
of justice must be satisfied first of all; that which is already due in
justice is not to be offered as a gift of charity":239
When we attend to the needs of those in want, we give them what is
theirs, not ours. More than performing works of mercy, we are paying a
debt of justice.240
2447 The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to
the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities.241
Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of
mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. the corporal
works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the
homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and
burying the dead.242 Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one
of the chief witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice
pleasing to God:243
He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none and he
who has food must do likewise.244 But give for alms those things
which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you.245 If a
brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says
to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the
things needed for the body, what does it profit?246
2448 "In its various forms - material deprivation, unjust oppression,
physical and psychological illness and death - human misery is the
obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for salvation
in which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This
misery elicited the compassion of Christ the Savior, who willingly took
it upon himself and identified himself with the least of his brethren.
Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a
preferential love on the part of the Church which, since her origin and
in spite of the failings of many of her members, has not ceased to work
for their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works of
charity which remain indispensable always and everywhere."247
2449 Beginning with the Old Testament, all kinds of juridical measures
(the jubilee year of forgiveness of debts, prohibition of loans at interest
and the keeping of collateral, the obligation to tithe, the daily payment
of the day-laborer, the right to glean vines and fields) answer the
exhortation of Deuteronomy: "For the poor will never cease out of the
land; therefore I command you, 'You shall open wide your hand to
your brother, to the needy and to the poor in the land.'"248 Jesus
makes these words his own: "The poor you always have with you, but
you do not always have me."249 In so doing he does not soften the
vehemence of former oracles against "buying the poor for silver and the
needy for a pair of sandals . . .," but invites us to recognize his own
presence in the poor who are his brethren:250
When her mother reproached her for caring for the poor and the sick
at home, St. Rose of Lima said to her: "When we serve the poor and
the sick, we serve Jesus. We must not fail to help our neighbors,
because in them we serve Jesus.251

Article 7 THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT
IN BRIEF
2450 "You shall not steal" (Ex 20:15; Deut 5:19). "Neither thieves, nor
the greedy, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor 6:10).
2451 The seventh commandment enjoins the practice of justice and
charity in the administration of earthly goods and the fruits of men's
labor.
2452 The goods of creation are destined for the entire human race. the
right to private property does not abolish the universal destination of
goods.
2453 The seventh commandment forbids theft. Theft is the usurpation
of another's goods against the reasonable will of the owner.
2454 Every manner of taking and using another's property unjustly is
contrary to the seventh commandment. the injustice committed
requires reparation. Commutative justice requires the restitution of
stolen goods.
2455 The moral law forbids acts which, for commercial or totalitarian
purposes, lead to the enslavement of human beings, or to their being
bought, sold or exchanged like merchandise.
2456 The dominion granted by the Creator over the mineral,
vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be separated
from respect for moral obligations, including those toward generations
to come.
2457 Animals are entrusted to man's stewardship; he must show them
kindness. They may be used to serve the just satisfaction of man's
needs.
2458 The Church makes a judgment about economic and social
matters when the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of
souls requires *. She is concerned with the temporal common good of
men because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, their ultimate
end.
2459 Man is himself the author, center, and goal of all economic and
social life. the decisive point of the social question is that goods created
by God for everyone should in fact reach everyone in accordance with
justice and with the help of charity.
2460 The primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author
and beneficiary. By means of his labor man participates in the work of
creation. Work united to Christ can be redemptive.
2461 True development concerns the whole man. It is concerned with
increasing each person's ability to respond to his vocation and hence to
God's call (cf CA 29).
2462 Giving alms to the poor is a witness to fraternal charity: it is also
a work of justice pleasing to God.
2463 How can we not recognize Lazarus, the hungry beggar in the
parable (cf Lk 17:19-31), in the multitude of human beings without
bread, a roof or a place to stay? How can we fail to hear Jesus: "As you
did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me" (Mt 25:45)?

Article 8 THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.252


It was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall
perform to the Lord what you have sworn."253
2464 The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in
our relations with others. This moral prescription flows from the
vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God who is the
truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth express by word or
deed a refusal to commit oneself to moral uprightness: they are
fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they undermine the
foundations of the covenant.

I. Living in the Truth
2465 The Old Testament attests that God is the source of all truth. His
Word is truth. His Law is truth. His "faithfulness endures to all
generations."254 Since God is "true," the members of his people are
called to live in the truth.255
2466 In Jesus Christ, the whole of God's truth has been made
manifest. "Full of grace and truth," he came as the "light of the world,"
he is the Truth.256 "Whoever believes in me may not remain in
darkness."257 The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know
"the truth [that] will make you free" and that sanctifies.258 To follow
Jesus is to live in "the Spirit of truth," whom the Father sends in his
name and who leads "into all the truth."259 To his disciples Jesus
teaches the unconditional love of truth: "Let what you say be simply
'Yes or No.'"260
2467 Man tends by nature toward the truth. He is obliged to honor
and bear witness to it: "It is in accordance with their dignity that all
men, because they are persons . . . are both impelled by their nature
and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious
truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they come to
know it and direct their whole lives in accordance with the demands of
truth."261
2468 Truth as uprightness in human action and speech is called
truthfulness, sincerity, or candor. Truth or truthfulness is the virtue
which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words,
and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy.
2469 "Men could not live with one another if there were not mutual
confidence that they were being truthful to one another."262 The
virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps to the just
mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept
secret: it entails honesty and discretion. In justice, "as a matter of
honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth."263
2470 The disciple of Christ consents to "live in the truth," that is, in
the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding
in his truth. "If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in
darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth."264

II. To Bear Witness to the Truth
2471 Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he "has come into the world,
to bear witness to the truth."265 The Christian is not to "be ashamed
then of testifying to our Lord."266 In situations that require witness to
the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation, after the
example of St. Paul before his judges. We must keep "a clear conscience
toward God and toward men."267
2472 The duty of Christians to take part in the life of the Church
impels them to act as witnesses of the Gospel and of the obligations
that flow from it. This witness is a transmission of the faith in words
and deeds. Witness is an act of justice that establishes the truth or
makes it known.268
All Christians by the example of their lives and the witness of their
word, wherever they live, have an obligation to manifest the new man
which they have put on in Baptism and to reveal the power of the Holy
Spirit by whom they were strengthened at Confirmation.
2473 Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith:
it means bearing witness even unto death. the martyr bears witness to
Christ who died and rose, to whom he is united by charity. He bears
witness to the truth of the faith and of Christian doctrine. He endures
death through an act of fortitude. "Let me become the food of the
beasts, through whom it will be given me to reach God."270
2474 The Church has painstakingly collected the records of those who
persevered to the end in witnessing to their faith. These are the acts of
the Martyrs. They form the archives of truth written in letters of blood:
Neither the pleasures of the world nor the kingdoms of this age will be
of any use to me.
It is better for me to die [in order to unite myself] to Christ Jesus than
to reign over the ends of the earth. I seek him who died for us; I desire
him who rose for us. My birth is approaching. . .271 I bless you for
having judged me worthy from this day and this hour to be counted
among your martyrs.... You have kept your promise, God of
faithfulness and truth. For this reason and for everything, I praise you,
I bless you, I glorify you through the eternal and heavenly High Priest,
Jesus Christ, your beloved Son. Through him, who is with you and the
Holy Spirit, may glory be given to you, now and in the ages to come.
Amen.272

III. Offenses Against Truth
2475 Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the
likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."273 By "putting
away falsehood," they are to "put away all malice and all guile and
insincerity and envy and all slander."274
2476 False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement
contrary to the truth takes on a particular gravity. In court it becomes
false witness.275 When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts such as these
contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty,
or the increased punishment of the accused.276 They gravely
compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of judicial
decisions.
2477 Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and
word likely to cause them unjust injury.277 He becomes guilty:
- of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient
foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor;
- of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses
another's faults and failings to persons who did not know them;278
- of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the
reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning
them.
2478 To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to interpret
insofar as possible his neighbor's thoughts, words, and deeds in a
favorable way:
Every good Christian ought to be more ready to give a favorable
interpretation to another's statement than to condemn it. But if he
cannot do so, let him ask how the other understands it. and if the latter
understands it badly, let the former correct him with love. If that does
not suffice, let the Christian try all suitable ways to bring the other to a
correct interpretation so that he may be saved.279
2479 Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of
one's neighbor. Honor is the social witness given to human dignity, and
everyone enjoys a natural right to the honor of his name and
reputation and to respect. Thus, detraction and calumny offend against
the virtues of justice and charity.
2480 Every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation,
or complaisance encourages and confirms another in malicious acts
and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an
accomplice in another's vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of
service nor friendship justifies duplicitous speech. Adulation is a venial
sin when it only seeks to be agreeable, to avoid evil, to meet a need, or
to obtain legitimate advantages.
2481 Boasting or bragging is an offense against truth. So is irony
aimed at disparaging someone by maliciously caricaturing some aspect
of his behavior.
2482 "A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of
deceiving."280 The Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil:
"You are of your father the devil, . . . there is no truth in him. When he
lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the
father of lies."281
2483 Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to
speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By
injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends
against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord.
2484 The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it
deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the
harm suffered by its victims. If a lie in itself only constitutes a venial
sin, it becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of
justice and charity.
2485 By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of
speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth
to others. the deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by
saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and
charity. the culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails
the risk of deadly consequences for those who are led astray.
2486 Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence
to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every
judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all
consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust
among men and tears apart the fabric of social relationships.
2487 Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the
duty of reparation, even if its author has been forgiven. When it is
impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be made
secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be directly
compensated, he must be given moral satisfaction in the name of
charity. This duty of reparation also concerns offenses against another's
reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes material, must be
evaluated in terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It obliges in
conscience.

IV. Respect for the Truth
2488 The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional.
Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love.
This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether or not it is
appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it.
2489 Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to
every request for information or communication. the good and safety
of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are sufficient
reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making
use of a discreet language. the duty to avoid scandal often commands
strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal the truth to someone who
does not have the right to know it.282
2490 The secret of the sacrament of reconciliation is sacred, and
cannot be violated under any pretext. "The sacramental seal is
inviolable; therefore, it is a crime for a confessor in any way to betray a
penitent by word or in any other manner or for any reason."283
2491 Professional secrets - for example, those of political office
holders, soldiers, physicians, and lawyers - or confidential information
given under the seal of secrecy must be kept, save in exceptional cases
where keeping the secret is bound to cause very grave harm to the one
who confided it, to the one who received it or to a third party, and
where the very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.
Even if not confided under the seal of secrecy, private information
prejudicial to another is not to be divulged without a grave and
proportionate reason.
2492 Everyone should observe an appropriate reserve concerning
persons' private lives. Those in charge of communications should
maintain a fair balance between the requirements of the common good
and respect for individual rights. Interference by the media in the
private lives of persons engaged in political or public activity is to be
condemned to the extent that it infringes upon heir privacy and
freedom.

V. The Use of the Social Communications Media
2493 Within modern society the communications media play a major
role in information, cultural promotion, and formation. This role is
increasing, as a result of technological progress, the extent and
diversity of the news transmitted, and the influence exercised on public
opinion.
2494 The information provided by the media is at the service of the
common good.284 Society has a right to information based on truth,
freedom, justice, and solidarity:
The proper exercise of this right demands that the content of the
communication be true and - within the limits set by justice and
charity - complete. Further, it should be communicated honestly and
properly. This means that in the gathering and in the publication of
news, the moral law and the legitimate rights and dignity of man
should be upheld.285
2495 "It is necessary that all members of society meet the demands of
justice and charity in this domain. They should help, through the
means of social communication, in the formation and diffusion of
sound public opinion."286 Solidarity is a consequence of genuine and
right communication and the free circulation of ideas that further
knowledge and respect for others.
2496 The means of social communication (especially the mass media)
can give rise to a certain passivity among users, making them less than
vigilant consumers of what is said or shown. Users should practice
moderation and discipline in their approach to the mass media. They
will want to form enlightened and correct consciences the more easily
to resist unwholesome influences.
2497 By the very nature of their profession, journalists have an
obligation to serve the truth and not offend against charity in
disseminating information. They should strive to respect, with equal
care, the nature of the facts and the limits of critical judgment
concerning individuals. They should not stoop to defamation.
2498 "Civil authorities have particular responsibilities in this field
because of the common good.... It is for the civil authority ... to defend
and safeguard a true and just freedom of information."287 By
promulgating laws and overseeing their application, public authorities
should ensure that "public morality and social progress are not gravely
endangered" through misuse of the media.288 Civil authorities should
punish any violation of the rights of individuals to their reputation and
privacy. They should give timely and reliable reports concerning the
general good or respond to the well-founded concerns of the people.
Nothing can justify recourse to disinformation for manipulating public
opinion through the media. Interventions by public authority should
avoid injuring the freedom of individuals or groups.
2499 Moral judgment must condemn the plague of totalitarian states
which systematically falsify the truth, exercise political control of
opinion through the media, manipulate defendants and witnesses at
public trials, and imagine that they secure their tyranny by strangling
and repressing everything they consider "thought crimes."

VI. Truth, Beauty, and Sacred Art
2500 The practice of goodness is accompanied by spontaneous
spiritual joy and moral beauty. Likewise, truth carries with it the joy
and splendor of spiritual beauty. Truth is beautiful in itself. Truth in
words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created and
uncreated reality, is necessary to man, who is endowed with intellect.
But truth can also find other complementary forms of human
expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond
words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the
mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of
truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of
creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony
of the cosmos - which both the child and the scientist discover - "from
the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding
perception of their Creator," "for the author of beauty created
them."289
[Wisdom] is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of
the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into
her. For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the
working of God, and an image of his goodness.290 For [wisdom] is
more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars.
Compared with the light she is found to be superior, for it is succeeded
by the night, but against wisdom evil does not prevail.291 I became
enamored of her beauty.292
2501 Created "in the image of God,"293 man also expresses the truth
of his relationship with God the Creator by the beauty of his artistic
works. Indeed, art is a distinctively human form of expression; beyond
the search for the necessities of life which is common to all living
creatures, art is a freely given superabundance of the human being's
inner riches. Arising from talent given by the Creator and from man's
own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom, uniting knowledge and
skill,294 to give form to the truth of reality in a language accessible to
sight or hearing. To the extent that it is inspired by truth and love of
beings, art bears a certain likeness to God's activity in what he has
created. Like any other human activity, art is not an absolute end in
itself, but is ordered to and ennobled by the ultimate end of man.295
2502 Sacred art is true and beautiful when its form corresponds to its
particular vocation: evoking and glorifying, in faith and adoration, the
transcendent mystery of God - the surpassing invisible beauty of truth
and love visible in Christ, who "reflects the glory of God and bears the
very stamp of his nature," in whom "the whole fullness of deity dwells
bodily."296 This spiritual beauty of God is reflected in the most holy
Virgin Mother of God, the angels, and saints. Genuine sacred art
draws man to adoration, to prayer, and to the love of God, Creator and
Savior, the Holy One and Sanctifier.
2503 For this reason bishops, personally or through delegates, should
see to the promotion of sacred art, old and new, in all its forms and,
with the same religious care, remove from the liturgy and from places
of worship everything which is not in conformity with the truth of faith
and the authentic beauty of sacred art.297

IN BRIEF
2504 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (Ex
20:16). Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the
likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness" (Eph 4:24).
2505 Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing
oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and guarding against
duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy.
2506 The Christian is not to "be ashamed of testifying to our Lord" (2
Tim 1:8) in deed and word. Martyrdom is the supreme witness given
to the truth of the faith.
2507 Respect for the reputation and honor of persons forbids all
detraction and calumny in word or attitude.
2508 Lying consists in saying what is false with the intention of
deceiving one's neighbor.
2509 An offense committed against the truth requires reparation.
2510 The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations,
whether or not it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone
who asks for it.
2511 "The sacramental seal is inviolable" (CIC, can. 983 # 1).
Professional secrets must be kept. Confidences prejudicial to another
are not to be divulged.
2512 Society has a right to information based on truth, freedom, and
justice. One should practice moderation and discipline in the use of the
social communications media.
2513 The fine arts, but above all sacred art, "of their nature are
directed toward expressing in some way the infinite beauty of God in
works made by human hands. Their dedication to the increase of God's
praise and of his glory is more complete, the more exclusively they are
devoted to turning men's minds devoutly toward God" (SC 122).

Article 9
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT
You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his
ass, or anything that is your neighbor's.298


Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed
adultery with her in his heart.299
2514 St. John distinguishes three kinds of covetousness or
concupiscence: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.300
In the Catholic catechetical tradition, the ninth commandment forbids
carnal concupiscence; the tenth forbids coveting another's goods.
2515 Etymologically, "concupiscence" can refer to any intense form of
human desire. Christian theology has given it a particular meaning: the
movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the operation of the
human reason. the apostle St. Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the
"flesh" against the "spirit."301 Concupiscence stems from the
disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's moral faculties and,
without being in itself an offense, inclines man to commit sins.302
2516 Because man is a composite being, spirit and body, there already
exists a certain tension in him; a certain struggle of tendencies between
"spirit" and "flesh" develops. But in fact this struggle belongs to the
heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin and at the same time a
confirmation of it. It is part of the daily experience of the spiritual
battle:
For the Apostle it is not a matter of despising and condemning the
body which with the spiritual soul constitutes man's nature and
personal subjectivity. Rather, he is concerned with the morally good or
bad works, or better, the permanent dispositions - virtues and vices -
which are the fruit of submission (in the first case) or of resistance (in
the second case) to the saving action of the Holy Spirit. For this reason
the Apostle writes: "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the
Spirit."303

I. Purification of the Heart
2517 The heart is the seat of moral personality: "Out of the heart come
evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication...."304 The struggle against
carnal covetousness entails purifying the heart and practicing
temperance:
Remain simple and innocent, and you will be like little children who
do not know the evil that destroys man's life.305
2518 The sixth beatitude proclaims, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God."306 "Pure in heart" refers to those who have
attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness,
chiefly in three areas: charity;307 chastity or sexual rectitude;308 love
of truth and orthodoxy of faith.309 There is a connection between
purity of heart, of body, and of faith:
The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed "so that by believing
they may obey God, by obeying may live well, by living well may purify
their hearts, and with pure hearts may understand what they
believe."310
2519 The "pure in heart" are promised that they will see God face to
face and be like him.311 Purity of heart is the precondition of the
vision of God. Even now it enables us to see according to God, to
accept others as "neighbors"; it lets us perceive the human body - ours
and our neighbor's - as a temple of the Holy Spirit, a manifestation of
divine beauty.

II. The Battle for Purity
2520 Baptism confers on its recipient the grace of purification from all
sins. But the baptized must continue to struggle against concupiscence
of the flesh and disordered desires. With God's grace he will prevail
- by the virtue and gift of chastity, for chastity lets us love with upright
and undivided heart;
- by purity of intention which consists in seeking the true end of man:
with simplicity of vision, the baptized person seeks to find and to fulfill
God's will in everything;312
- by purity of vision, external and internal; by discipline of feelings and
imagination; by refusing all complicity in impure thoughts that incline
us to turn aside from the path of God's commandments: "Appearance
arouses yearning in fools";313
- by prayer:
I thought that continence arose from one's own powers, which I did
not recognize in myself. I was foolish enough not to know . . . that no
one can be continent unless you grant it. For you would surely have
granted it if my inner groaning had reached your ears and I with firm
faith had cast my cares on you.314
2521 Purity requires modesty, an integral part of temperance. Modesty
protects the intimate center of the person. It means refusing to unveil
what should remain hidden. It is ordered to chastity to whose
sensitivity it bears witness. It guides how one looks at others and
behaves toward them in conformity with the dignity of persons and
their solidarity.
2522 Modesty protects the mystery of persons and their love. It
encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships; it requires
that the conditions for the definitive giving and commitment of man
and woman to one another be fulfilled. Modesty is decency. It inspires
one's choice of clothing. It keeps silence or reserve where there is
evident risk of unhealthy curiosity. It is discreet.
2523 There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It
protests, for example, against the voyeuristic explorations of the human
body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of certain
media that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty
inspires a way of life which makes it possible to resist the allurements
of fashion and the pressures of prevailing ideologies.
2524 The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another.
Everywhere, however, modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual
dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening consciousness of
being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means
awakening in them respect for the human person.
2525 Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate. It
requires of the communications media that their presentations show
concern for respect and restraint. Purity of heart brings freedom from
widespread eroticism and avoids entertainment inclined to voyeurism
and illusion.
2526 So called moral permissiveness rests on an erroneous conception
of human freedom; the necessary precondition for the development of
true freedom is to let oneself be educated in the moral law. Those in
charge of education can reasonably be expected to give young people
instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the
moral and spiritual dignity of man.
2527 "The Good News of Christ continually renews the life and
culture of fallen man; it combats and removes the error and evil which
flow from the ever-present attraction of sin. It never ceases to purify
and elevate the morality of peoples. It takes the spiritual qualities and
endowments of every age and nation, and with supernatural riches it
causes them to blossom, as it were, from within; it fortifies, completes,
and restores them in Christ."315

which is concerned with concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids coveting
the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, and fraud, which the
seventh commandment forbids. "Lust of the eyes" leads to the violence
and injustice forbidden by the fifth commandment.318 Avarice, like
fornication, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three
prescriptions of the Law.319 The tenth commandment concerns the
intentions of the heart; with the ninth, it summarizes all the precepts of
the Law.

I. The Disorder of Covetous Desires
2535 The sensitive appetite leads us to desire pleasant things we do not
have, e.g., the desire to eat when we are hungry or to warm ourselves
when we are cold. These desires are good in themselves; but often they
exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not
ours and belongs to another or is owed to him.
2536 The tenth commandment forbids greed and the desire to amass
earthly goods without limit. It forbids avarice arising from a passion for
riches and their attendant power. It also forbids the desire to commit
injustice by harming our neighbor in his temporal goods:
When the Law says, "You shall not covet," these words mean that we
should banish our desires for whatever does not belong to us. Our
thirst for another's goods is immense, infinite, never quenched. Thus it
is written: "He who loves money never has money enough."320
2537 It is not a violation of this commandment to desire to obtain
things that belong to one's neighbor, provided this is done by just
means. Traditional catechesis realistically mentions "those who have a
harder struggle against their criminal desires" and so who "must be
urged the more to keep this commandment":
. . . merchants who desire scarcity and rising prices, who cannot bear
not to be the only ones buying and selling so that they themselves can
sell more dearly and buy more cheaply; those who hope that their peers
will be impoverished, in order to realize a profit either by selling to
them or buying from them . . . physicians who wish disease to spread;
lawyers who are eager for many important cases and trials.321
2538 The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from
the human heart. When the prophet Nathan wanted to spur King
David to repentance, he told him the story about the poor man who
had only one ewe lamb that he treated like his own daughter and the
rich man who, despite the great number of his flocks, envied the poor
man and ended by stealing his lamb.322 Envy can lead to the worst
crimes.323 "Through the devil's envy death entered the world":324
We fight one another, and envy arms us against one another.... If
everyone strives to unsettle the Body of Christ, where shall we end up?
We are engaged in making Christ's Body a corpse.... We declare
ourselves members of one and the same organism, yet we devour one
another like beasts.325
2539 Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of
another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself,
even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a neighbor it is a mortal
sin:
St. Augustine saw envy as "the diabolical sin."326 "From envy are born
hatred, detraction, calumny, joy caused by the misfortune of a
neighbor, and displeasure caused by his prosperity."327
2540 Envy represents a form of sadness and therefore a refusal of
charity; the baptized person should struggle against it by exercising
good will. Envy often comes from pride; the baptized person should
train himself to live in humility:
Would you like to see God glorified by you? Then rejoice in your
brother's progress and you will immediately give glory to God. Because
his servant could conquer envy by rejoicing in the merits of others,
God will be praised.328

II. The Desires of the Spirit
2541 The economy of law and grace turns men's hearts away from
avarice and envy. It initiates them into desire for the Sovereign Good; it
instructs them in the desires of the Holy Spirit who satisfies man's
heart.
The God of the promises always warned man against seduction by
what from the beginning has seemed "good for food . . . a delight to the
eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise."329
2542 The Law entrusted to Israel never sufficed to justify those subject
to it; it even became the instrument of "lust."330 The gap between
wanting and doing points to the conflict between God's Law which is
the "law of my mind," and another law "making me captive to the law
of sin which dwells in my members."331
2543 "But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart
from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who
believe."332 Henceforth, Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with
its passions and desires"; they are led by the Spirit and follow the
desires of the Spirit.333

III. Poverty of Heart
2544 Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and
everyone, and bids them "renounce all that [they have]" for his sake
and that of the Gospel.334 Shortly before his passion he gave them the
example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her poverty, gave
all that she had to live on.335 The precept of detachment from riches
is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven.
2545 All Christ's faithful are to "direct their affections rightly, lest they
be hindered in their pursuit of perfect charity by the use of worldly
things and by an adherence to riches which is contrary to the spirit of
evangelical poverty."336
2546 "Blessed are the poor in spirit."337 The Beatitudes reveal an
order of happiness and grace, of beauty and peace. Jesus celebrates the
joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already belongs:338
The Word speaks of voluntary humility as "poverty in spirit"; the
Apostle gives an example of God's poverty when he says: "For your
sakes he became poor."339
2547 The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their
consolation in the abundance of goods.340 "Let the proud seek and
love earthly kingdoms, but blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the
Kingdom of heaven."341 Abandonment to the providence of the
Father in heaven frees us from anxiety about tomorrow.342 Trust in
God is a preparation for the blessedness of the poor. They shall see
God.

IV. "I Want to See God"
2548 Desire for true happiness frees man from his immoderate
attachment to the goods of this world so that he can find his fulfillment
in the vision and beatitude of God. "The promise [of seeing God]
surpasses all beatitude.... In Scripture, to see is to possess.... Whoever
sees God has obtained all the goods of which he can conceive."343
2549 It remains for the holy people to struggle, with grace from on
high, to obtain the good things God promises. In order to possess and
contemplate God, Christ's faithful mortify their cravings and, with the
grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power.
2550 On this way of perfection, the Spirit and the Bride call whoever
hears them344 to perfect communion with God:
There will true glory be, where no one will be praised by mistake or
flattery; true honor will not be refused to the worthy, nor granted to
the unworthy; likewise, no one unworthy will pretend to be worthy,
where only those who are worthy will be admitted. There true peace
will reign, where no one will experience opposition either from self or
others. God himself will be virtue's reward; he gives virtue and has
promised to give himself as the best and greatest reward that could
exist.... "I shall be their God and they will be my people...." This is also
the meaning of the Apostle's words: "So that God may be all in all."
God himself will be the goal of our desires; we shall contemplate him
without end, love him without surfeit, praise him without weariness.
This gift, this state, this act, like eternal life itself, will assuredly be
common to all.345

2554 The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility,
and abandonment to the providence of God.
2555 Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with its passions and
desires" Gal 5:24); they are led by the Spirit and follow his desires.
2556 Detachment from riches is necessary for entering the Kingdom
of heaven. "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
2557 "I want to see God" expresses the true desire of man. Thirst for
God is quenched by the water of eternal life (cf In 4:14).




PART FOUR: CHRISTIAN PRAYER
SECTION ONEPRAYER IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
2558 "Great is the mystery of the faith!"
The Church professes this mystery in the Apostles' Creed (Part One)
and celebrates it in the sacramental liturgy (Part Two), so that the life
of the faithful may be conformed to Christ in the Holy Spirit to the
glory of God the Father (Part Three).
This mystery, then, requires that the faithful believe in it, that they
celebrate it, and that they live from it in a vital and personal
relationship with the living and true God. This relationship is prayer.
WHAT IS PRAYER?
For me, prayer is a surge of the heart;
it is a simple look turned toward heaven,
it is a cry of recognition and of love,
embracing both trial and joy.1
Prayer as God's gift
2559 "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the
requesting of good things from God."2
But when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will,
or "out of the depths" of a humble and contrite heart?3
He who humbles himself will be exalted;4 humility is the foundation of
prayer,
Only when we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray
as we ought,"5 are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer.
"Man is a beggar before God."6
2560 "If you knew the gift of God!"7
The wonder of prayer is revealed beside the well where we come
seeking water: there, Christ comes to meet every human being.
It is he who first seeks us and asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his
asking arises from the depths of God's desire for us.
Whether we realize it or not, prayer is the encounter of God's thirst
with ours. God thirsts that we may thirst for him.8
2561 "You would have asked him, and he would have given you living
water."9
Paradoxically our prayer of petition is a response to the plea of the
living God:
"They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn out
cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water!"10
Prayer is the response of faith to the free promise of salvation and also
a response of love to the thirst of the only Son of God.11
Prayer as covenant
2562 Where does prayer come from?
Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man
who prays.
But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the
soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand
times).
According to Scripture, it is the heart that prays.
If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain.
2563 The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live;
according to the Semitic or Biblical expression, the heart is the place
"to which I withdraw."
The heart is our hidden center, beyond the grasp of our reason and of
others;
only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it fully.
The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives.
It is the place of truth, where we choose life or death.
It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in
relation:
it is the place of covenant.
2564 Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and
man in Christ.
It is the action of God and of man, springing forth from both the Holy
Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to the Father, in union with the
human will of the Son of God made man.
Prayer as communion
2565 In the New Covenant, prayer is the living relationship of the
children of God with their Father who is good beyond measure, with
his Son Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit.
The grace of the Kingdom is "the union of the entire holy and royal
Trinity . . . with the whole human spirit."12
Thus, the life of prayer is the habit of being in the presence of the
thrice-holy God and in communion with him.
This communion of life is always possible because, through Baptism,
we have already been united with Christ.13
Prayer is Christian insofar as it is communion with Christ and extends
throughout the Church, which is his Body.
Its dimensions are those of Christ's love.14

CHAPTER ONE
THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE UNIVERSAL CALL TO
PRAYER
2566 Man is in search of God. In the act of creation, God calls every
being from nothingness into existence. "Crowned with glory and
honor," man is, after the angels, capable of acknowledging "how
majestic is the name of the Lord in all the earth."1 Even after losing
through his sin his likeness to God, man remains an image of his
Creator, and retains the desire for the one who calls him into existence.
All religions bear witness to men's essential search for God.2
2567 God calls man first. Man may forget his Creator or hide far from
his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having
abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each person
to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful
God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first step is always a
response. As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself,
prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words
and actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the
whole history of salvation.

CHAPTER ONE THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE
UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER




Article 1 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
2568 In the Old Testament, the revelation of prayer comes between the
fall and the restoration of man, that is, between God's sorrowful call to
his first children: "Where are you? . . . What is this that you have one?"3
and the response of God's only Son on coming into the world: "Lo, I
have come to do your will, O God."4 Prayer is bound up with human
history, for it is the relationship with God in historical events.
Creation - source of prayer
2569 Prayer is lived in the first place beginning with the realities of
creation. the first nine chapters of Genesis describe this relationship
with God as an offering of the first-born of Abel's flock, as the
invocation of the divine name at the time of Enosh, and as "walking
with God.5 Noah's offering is pleasing to God, who blesses him and
through him all creation, because his heart was upright and undivided;
Noah, like Enoch before him, "walks with God."6 This kind of prayer is
lived by many righteous people in all religions.
In his indefectible covenant with every living creature,7 God has
always called people to prayer. But it is above all beginning with our
father Abraham that prayer is revealed in the Old Testament.
God's promise and the prayer of Faith
2570 When God calls him, Abraham goes forth "as the Lord had told
him";8 Abraham's heart is entirely submissive to the Word and so he
obeys. Such attentiveness of the heart, whose decisions are made
according to God's will, is essential to prayer, while the words used
count only in relation to it. Abraham's prayer is expressed first by
deeds: a man of silence, he constructs an altar to the Lord at each stage
of his journey. Only later does Abraham's first prayer in words appear:
a veiled complaint reminding God of his promises which seem
unfulfilled.9 Thus one aspect of the drama of prayer appears from the
beginning: the test of faith in the fidelity of God.
2571 Because Abraham believed in God and walked in his presence
and in covenant with him,10 The patriarch is ready to welcome a
mysterious Guest into his tent. Abraham's remarkable hospitality at
Mamre foreshadows the annunciation of the true Son of the
promise.11 After that, once God had confided his plan, Abraham's
heart is attuned to his Lord's compassion for men and he dares to
intercede for them with bold confidence.12
2572 As a final stage in the purification of his faith, Abraham, "who
had received the promises,"13 is asked to sacrifice the son God had
given him. Abraham's faith does not weaken (“God himself will
provide the lamb for a burnt offering."), for he "considered that God
was able to raise men even from the dead."14 and so the father of
believers is conformed to the likeness of the Father who will not spare
his own Son but wiLl deliver him up for us all.15 Prayer restores man
to God's likeness and enables him to share in the power of God's love
that saves the multitude.16
2573 God renews his promise to Jacob, the ancestor of the twelve
tribes of Israel.17 Before confronting his elder brother Esau, Jacob
wrestles all night with a mysterious figure who refuses to reveal his
name, but he blesses him before leaving him at dawn. From this
account, the spiritual tradition of the Church has retained the symbol
of prayer as a battle of faith and as the triumph of perseverance.18
Moses and the prayer of the mediator
2574 Once the promise begins to be fulfilled (Passover, the Exodus,
the gift of the Law, and the ratification of the covenant), the prayer of
Moses becomes the most striking example of intercessory prayer,
which will be fulfilled in "the one mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus."19
2575 Here again the initiative is God's. From the midst of the burning
bush he calls Moses.20 This event will remain one of the primordial
images of prayer in the spiritual tradition of Jews and Christians alike.
When "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob" calls Moses to be
his servant, it is because he is the living God who wants men to live.
God reveals himself in order to save them, though he does not do this
alone or despite them: he caLls Moses to be his messenger, an
associate in his compassion, his work of salvation. There is something
of a divine plea in this mission, and only after long debate does Moses
attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But in the dialogue in
which God confides in him, Moses also learns how to pray: he balks,
makes excuses, above all questions: and it is in response to his question
that the Lord confides his ineffable name, which will be revealed
through his mighty deeds.
2576 "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man
speaks to his friend."21 Moses' prayer is characteristic of contemplative
prayer by which God's servant remains faithful to his mission. Moses
converses with God often and at length, climbing the mountain to hear
and entreat him and coming down to the people to repeat the words of
his God for their guidance. Moses "is entrusted with all my house.
With him I speak face to face, clearly, not in riddles," for "Moses was
very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth."22
2577 From this intimacy with the faithful God, slow to anger and
abounding in steadfast love,23 Moses drew strength and determination
for his intercession. He does not pray for himself but for the people
whom God made his own. Moses already intercedes for them during
the battle with the Amalekites and prays to obtain healing for
Miriam.24 But it is chiefly after their apostasy that Moses "stands in
the breach" before God in order to save the people.25 The arguments
of his prayer - for intercession is also a mysterious battle - will inspire
the boldness of the great intercessors among the Jewish people and in
the Church: God is love; he is therefore righteous and faithful; he
cannot contradict himself; he must remember his marvellous deeds,
since his glory is at stake, and he cannot forsake this people that bears
his name.
David and the prayer of the king
2578 The prayer of the People of God flourishes in the shadow of
God's dwelling place, first the ark of the covenant and later the Temple.
At first the leaders of the people - the shepherds and the prophets -
teach them to pray. the infant Samuel must have learned from his
mother Hannah how "to stand before the LORD" and from the priest
Eli how to listen to his word: "Speak, LORD, for your servant is
listening."26 Later, he will also know the cost and consequence of
intercession: "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin
against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; and I will instruct you in
the good and the right way."27
2579 David is par excellence the king "after God's own heart," the
shepherd who prays for his people and prays in their name. His
submission to the will of God, his praise, and his repentance, will be a
model for the prayer of the people. His prayer, the prayer of God's
Anointed, is a faithful adherence to the divine promise and expresses a
loving and joyful trust in God, the only King and Lord.28 In the
Psalms David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the first prophet of Jewish
and Christian prayer. the prayer of Christ, the true Messiah and Son of
David, will reveal and fulfill the meaning of this prayer.
2580 The Temple of Jerusalem, the house of prayer that David wanted
to build, will be the work of his son, Solomon. the prayer at the
dedication of the Temple relies on God's promise and covenant, on the
active presence of his name among his People, recalling his mighty
deeds at the Exodus.29 The king lifts his hands toward heaven and
begs the Lord, on his own behalf, on behalf of the entire people, and of
the generations yet to come, for the forgiveness of their sins and for
their daily needs, so that the nations may know that He is the only God
and that the heart of his people may belong wholly and entirely to him.
Elijah, the prophets and conversion of heart
2581 For the People of God, the Temple was to be the place of their
education in prayer: pilgrimages, feasts and sacrifices, the evening
offering, the incense, and the bread of the Presence (“shewbread") - all
these signs of the holiness and glory of God Most High and Most Near
were appeals to and ways of prayer. But ritualism often encouraged an
excessively external worship. the people needed education in faith and
conversion of heart; this was the mission of the prophets, both before
and after the Exile.


2582 Elijah is the "father" of the prophets, "the generation of those
who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob."30 Elijah's name,
"The Lord is my God," foretells the people's cry in response to his
prayer on Mount Carmel.31 St. James refers to Elijah in order to
encourage us to pray: "The prayer of the righteous is powerful and
effective."32
2583 After Elijah had learned mercy during his retreat at the Wadi
Cherith, he teaches the widow of Zarephath to believe in the Word of
God and confirms her faith by his urgent prayer: God brings the
widow's child back to life.33 The sacrifice on Mount Carmel is a
decisive test for the faith of the People of God. In response to Elijah's
plea, "Answer me, O LORD, answer me," the Lord's fire consumes the
holocaust, at the time of the evening oblation. the Eastern liturgies
repeat Elijah's plea in the Eucharistic epiclesis.
Finally, taking the desert road that leads to the place where the living
and true God reveals himself to his people, Elijah, like Moses before
him, hides "in a cleft of he rock" until the mysterious presence of God
has passed by.34 But only on the mountain of the Transfiguration will
Moses and Elijah behold the unveiled face of him whom they sought;
"the light of the knowledge of the glory of God [shines] in the face of
Christ," crucified and risen.35
2584 In their "one to one" encounters with God, the prophets draw
light and strength for their mission. Their prayer is not flight from this
unfaithful world, but rather attentiveness to the Word of God. At times
their prayer is an argument or a complaint, but it is always an
intercession that awaits and prepares for the intervention of the Savior
God, the Lord of history.36
The Psalms, the prayer of the assembly
2585 From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts
appearing in these sacred books show a deepening in prayer for oneself
and in prayer for others.37 Thus the psalms were gradually collected
into the five books of the Psalter (or "Praises"), the masterwork of
prayer in the Old Testament.
2586 The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of the
People of God gathered during the great feasts at Jerusalem and each
Sabbath in the synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably personal and
communal; it concerns both those who are praying and all men. the
Psalms arose from the communities of the Holy Land and the
Diaspora, but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the saving
events of the past, yet extends into the future, even to the end of
history; it commemorates the promises God has already kept, and
awaits the Messiah who will fulfill them definitively. Prayed by Christ
and fulfilled in him, the Psalms remain essential to the prayer of the
Church.38
2587 The Psalter is the book in which the Word of God becomes man's
prayer. In other books of the Old Testament, "the words proclaim
[God's] works and bring to light the mystery they contain."39 The
words of the Psalmist, sung for God, both express and acclaim the
Lord's saving works; the same Spirit inspires both God's work and
man's response. Christ will unite the two. In him, the psalms continue
to teach us how to pray.
2588 The Psalter's many forms of prayer take shape both in the liturgy
of the Temple and in the human heart. Whether hymns or prayers of
lamentation or thanksgiving, whether individual or communal, whether
royal chants, songs of pilgrimage or wisdom meditations, the Psalms
are a mirror of God's marvelous deeds in the history of his people, as
well as reflections of the human experiences of the Psalmist. Though a
given psalm may reflect an event of the past, it still possesses such
direct simplicity that it can be prayed in truth by men of all times and
conditions.
2589 Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the Psalms:
simplicity and spontaneity of prayer; the desire for God himself
through and with all that is good in his creation; the distraught
situation of the believer who, in his preferential love for the Lord, is
exposed to a host of enemies and temptations, but who waits upon
what the faithful God will do, in the certitude of his love and in
submission to his will. the prayer of the psalms is always sustained by
praise; that is why the title of this collection as handed down to us is so
fitting: "The Praises." Collected for the assembly's worship, the Psalter
both sounds the call to prayer and sings the response to that call:
Hallelu-Yah! (“Alleluia"), "Praise the Lord!"
What is more pleasing than a psalm? David expresses it well: "Praise
the Lord, for a psalm is good: let there be praise of our God with
gladness and grace!" Yes, a psalm is a blessing on the lips of the people,
praise of God, the assembly's homage, a general acclamation, a word
that speaks for all, the voice of the Church, a confession of faith in
song.40

UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER




Article 1 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT




IN BRIEF
2590 "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the
requesting of good things from God" (St. John Damascene, Defide
orth. 3, 24: PG 94, 1089C).
2591 God tirelessly calls each person to this mysterious encounter with
Himself. Prayer unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation as a
reciprocal call between God and man.
2592 The prayer of Abraham and Jacob is presented as a battle of faith
marked by trust in God's faithfulness and by certitude in the victory
promised to perseverance.
2593 The prayer of Moses responds to the living God's initiative for the
salvation of his people. It foreshadows the prayer of intercession of the
unique mediator, Christ Jesus.
2594 The prayer of the People of God flourished in the shadow of the
dwelling place of God's presence on earth, the ark of the covenant and
the Temple, under the guidance of their shepherds, especially King
David, and of the prophets.
2595 The prophets summoned the people to conversion of heart and,
while zealously seeking the face of God, like Elijah, they interceded for
the people.
2596 The Psalms constitute the masterwork of prayer in the Old
Testament. They present two inseparable qualities: the personal, and
the communal. They extend to all dimensions of history, recalling
God's promises already fulfilled and looking for the coming of the
Messiah.
2597 Prayed and fulfilled in Christ, the Psalms are an essential and
permanent element of the prayer of the Church. They are suitable for
men of every condition and time.

CHAPTER ONE THE REVELATION OF PRAYER - THE
UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER




Article 2 IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME
2598 The drama of prayer is fully revealed to us in the Word who
became flesh and dwells among us. To seek to understand his prayer
through what his witnesses proclaim to us in the Gospel is to approach
the holy Lord Jesus as Moses approached the burning bush: first to
contemplate him in prayer, then to hear how he teaches us to pray, in
order to know how he hears our prayer.
Jesus prays
2599 The Son of God who became Son of the Virgin learned to pray
according to his human heart. He learns the formulas of prayer from
his mother, who kept in her heart and meditated upon all the "great
things" done by the Almighty.41 He learns to pray in the words and
rhythms of the prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and
the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer springs from an otherwise
secret source, as he intimates at the age of twelve: "I must be in my
Father's house."42 Here the newness of prayer in the fullness of time
begins to be revealed: his filial prayer, which the Father awaits from his
children, is finally going to be lived out by the only Son in his
humanity, with and for men.
2600 The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of the
Holy Spirit and the meaning of prayer in Christ's ministry. Jesus prays
before the decisive moments of his mission: before his Father's witness
to him during his baptism and Transfiguration, and before his own
fulfillment of the Father's plan of love by his Passion.43 He also prays
before the decisive moments involving the mission of his apostles: at
his election and call of the Twelve, before Peter's confession of him as
"the Christ of God," and again that the faith of the chief of the
Apostles may not fail when tempted.44 Jesus' prayer before the events
of salvation that the Father has asked him to fulfill is a humble and
trusting commitment of his human will to the loving will of the Father.
2601 "He was praying in a certain place and when he had ceased, one
of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray."'45 In seeing the
Master at prayer the disciple of Christ also wants to pray. By
contemplating and hearing the Son, the master of prayer, the children
learn to pray to the Father.
2602 Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude, on a mountain,
preferably at night.46 He includes all men in his prayer, for he has
taken on humanity in his incarnation, and he offers them to the Father
when he offers himself. Jesus, the Word who has become flesh, shares
by his human prayer in all that "his brethren" experience; he
sympathizes with their weaknesses in order to free them.47 It was for
this that the Father sent him. His words and works are the visible
manifestation of his prayer in secret.


2603 The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered
by Christ during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In
the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him
because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who
think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of
the Beatitudes.48 His exclamation, "Yes, Father!" expresses the depth
of his heart, his adherence to the Father's "good pleasure," echoing his
mother's Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will
say to the Father in his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in
this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of
the Father.49
2604 The second prayer, before the raising of Lazarus, is recorded by
St. John.50 Thanksgiving precedes the event: "Father, I thank you for
having heard me," which implies that the Father always hears his
petitions. Jesus immediately adds: "I know that you always hear me,"
which implies that Jesus, on his part, constantly made such petitions.
Jesus' prayer, characterized by thanksgiving, reveals to us how to ask:
before the gift is given, Jesus commits himself to the One who in giving
gives himself. the Giver is more precious than the gift; he is the
"treasure"; in him abides his Son's heart; the gift is given "as well."51
The priestly prayer of Jesus holds a unique place in the economy of
salvation.52 A meditation on it will conclude Section One. It reveals
the ever present prayer of our High Priest and, at the same time,
contains what he teaches us about our prayer to our Father, which will
be developed in Section Two.
2605 When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father's plan of
love, Jesus allows a glimpse of the boundless depth of his filial prayer,
not only before he freely delivered himself up (“Abba . . . not my will,
but yours."),53 but even in his last words on the Cross, where prayer
and the gift of self are but one: "Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do",54 "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in
Paradise",55 "Woman, behold your son" - "Behold your mother",56 "I
thirst.";57 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"58 "It is
finished";59 "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!"60 until the
"loud cry" as he expires, giving up his spirit.61
2606 All the troubles, for all time, of humanity enslaved by sin and
death, all the petitions and intercessions of salvation history are
summed up in this cry of the incarnate Word. Here the Father accepts
them and, beyond all hope, answers them by raising his Son. Thus is
fulfilled and brought to completion the drama of prayer in the
economy of creation and salvation. the Psalter gives us the key to
prayer in Christ. In the "today" of the Resurrection the Father says:
"You are my Son, today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will
make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your
possession."62
The Letter to the Hebrews expresses in dramatic terms how the prayer
of Jesus accomplished the victory of salvation: "In the days of his flesh,
Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to
him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his
godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what
he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the source of eternal
salvation to all who obey him."63


Jesus teaches us how to pray
2607 When Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray. His
prayer to his Father is the theological path (the path of faith, hope, and
charity) of our prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives us Jesus'
explicit teaching on prayer. Like a wise teacher he takes hold of us
where we are and leads us progressively toward the Father. Addressing
the crowds following him, Jesus builds on what they already know of
prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to them the newness of the
coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this newness to them in parables.
Finally, he will speak openly of the Father and the Holy Spirit to his
disciples who will be the teachers of prayer in his Church.
2608 From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on
conversion of heart: reconciliation with one's brother before presenting
an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors,
prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful
forgiveness from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking
the Kingdom before all else.64 This filial conversion is entirely directed
to the Father.
2609 Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith.
Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand.
It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He
can ask us to "seek" and to "knock," since he himself is the door and
the way.65
2610 Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before receiving
his gifts, so he teaches us filial boldness: "Whatever you ask in prayer,
believe that you receive it, and you will."66 Such is the power of prayer
and of faith that does not doubt: "all things are possible to him who
believes."67 Jesus is as saddened by the "lack of faith" of his own
neighbors and the "little faith" of his own disciples68 as he is struck
with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the
Canaanite woman.69
2611 The prayer of faith consists not only in saying "Lord, Lord," but
in disposing the heart to do the will of the Father.70 Jesus calls his
disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for cooperating with
the divine plan.71
2612 In Jesus "the Kingdom of God is at hand."72 He calls his hearers
to conversion and faith, but also to watchfulness. In prayer the disciple
keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who Comes, in
memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the
hope of his second coming in glory.73 In communion with their
Master, the disciples' prayer is a battle; only by keeping watch in prayer
can one avoid falling into temptation.74
2613 Three principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St.
Luke:
- the first, "the importunate friend,"75 invites us to urgent prayer:
"Knock, and it will be opened to you." To the one who prays like this,
the heavenly Father will "give whatever he needs," and above all the
Holy Spirit who contains all gifts.
- the second, "the importunate widow,"76 is centered on one of the
qualities of prayer: it is necessary to pray always without ceasing and
with the patience of faith. "and yet, when the Son of Man comes, will
he find faith on earth?"
- the third parable, "the Pharisee and the tax collector,"77 concerns the
humility of the heart that prays. "God, be merciful to me a sinner!" the
Church continues to make this prayer its own: Kyrie eleison!
2614 When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer
to the Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be,
once he has returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is
new is to "ask in his name."78 Faith in the Son introduces the disciples
into the knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is "the way, and the
truth, and the life."79 Faith bears its fruit in love: it means keeping the
word and the commandments of Jesus, it means abiding with him in
the Father who, in him, so loves us that he abides with us. In this new
covenant the certitude that our petitions will be heard is founded on
the prayer of Jesus.80
2615 Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is united
with that of Jesus is "another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even
the Spirit of truth."81 This new dimension of prayer and of its
circumstances is displayed throughout the farewell discourse.82 In the
Holy Spirit, Christian prayer is a communion of love with the Father,
not only through Christ but also in him: "Hitherto you have asked
nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be
full."83
Jesus hears our prayer
2616 Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry,
through signs that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection:
Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the
Canaanite woman, the good thief)84 or in silence (the bearers of the
paralytic, the woman with a hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the
tears and ointment of the sinful woman).85 The urgent request of the
blind men, "Have mercy on us, Son of David" or "Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!" has-been renewed in the traditional prayer to Jesus
known as the Jesus Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy
on me, a sinner!"86 Healing infirmities or forgiving sins, Jesus always
responds to a prayer offered in faith: "Your faith has made you well; go
in peace."
St. Augustine wonderfully summarizes the three dimensions of Jesus'
prayer: "He prays for us as our priest, prays in us as our Head, and is
prayed to by us as our God. Therefore let us acknowledge our voice in
him and his in us."87
The prayer of the Virgin Mary
2617 Mary's prayer is revealed to us at the dawning of the fullness of
time. Before the incarnation of the Son of God, and before the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, her prayer cooperates in a unique way
with the Father's plan of loving kindness: at the Annunciation, for
Christ's conception; at Pentecost, for the formation of the Church, his
Body.88 In the faith of his humble handmaid, the Gift of God found
the acceptance he had awaited from the beginning of time. She whom
the Almighty made "full of grace" responds by offering her whole
being: "Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be [done] to me
according to your word." "Fiat": this is Christian prayer: to be wholly
God's, because he is wholly ours.
2618 The Gospel reveals to us how Mary prays and intercedes in faith.
At Cana,89 The mother of Jesus asks her son for the needs of a
wedding feast; this is the sign of another feast - that of the wedding of
the Lamb where he gives his body and blood at the request of the
Church, his Bride. It is at the hour of the New Covenant, at the foot of
the cross,90 that Mary is heard as the Woman, the new Eve, the true
"Mother of all the living."
2619 That is why the Canticle of Mary,91 The Magnificat (Latin) or
Megalynei (byzantine) is the song both of the Mother of God and of
the Church; the song of the Daughter of Zion and of the new People of
God; the song of thanksgiving for the fullness of graces poured out in
the economy of salvation and the song of the "poor" whose hope is met
by the fulfillment of the promises made to our ancestors, "to Abraham
and to his posterity for ever."

IN BRIEF
2620 Jesus' filial prayer is the perfect model of prayer in the New
Testament. Often done in solitude and in secret, the prayer of Jesus
involves a loving adherence to the will of the Father even to the Cross
and an absolute confidence in being heard.
2621 In his teaching, Jesus teaches his disciples to pray with a purified
heart, with lively and persevering faith, with filial boldness. He calls
them to vigilance and invites them to present their petitions to God in
his name. Jesus Christ himself answers prayers addressed to him.
2622 The prayers of the Virgin Mary, in her Fiat and Magnificat, are
characterized by the generous offering of her whole being in faith.

Article 3 IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH
2623 On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit of the Promise was poured
out on the disciples, gathered "together in one place."92 While awaiting
the Spirit, "all these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer."93
The Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls for her everything that
Jesus said94 was also to form her in the life of prayer.
2624 In the first community of Jerusalem, believers "devoted
themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of
bread, and the prayers."95 This sequence is characteristic of the
Church's prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated by
charity; nourished in the Eucharist.
2625 In the first place these are prayers that the faithful hear and read
in the Scriptures, but also that they make their own - especially those
of the Psalms, in view of their fulfillment in Christ.96 The Holy Spirit,
who thus keeps the memory of Christ alive in his Church at prayer,
also leads her toward the fullness of truth and inspires new
formulations expressing the unfathomable mystery of Christ at work in
his Church's life, sacraments, and mission. These formulations are
developed in the great liturgical and spiritual traditions. the forms of
prayer revealed in the apostolic and canonical Scriptures remain
normative for Christian prayer.

I. Blessing and Adoration
2626 Blessing expresses the basic movement of Christian prayer: it is
an encounter between God and man. In blessing, God's gift and man's
acceptance of it are united in dialogue with each other. the prayer of
blessing is man's response to God's gifts: because God blesses, the
human heart can in return bless the One who is the source of every
blessing.
2627 TWO fundamental forms express this movement: our prayer
ascends in the Holy Spirit through Christ to the Father - we bless him
for having blessed us;97 it implores the grace of the Holy Spirit that
descends through Christ from the Father - he blesses us.98
2628 Adoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that he is a
creature before his Creator. It exalts the greatness of the Lord who
made us99 and the almighty power of the Savior who sets us free from
evil. Adoration is homage of the spirit to the "King of Glory,"100
respectful silence in the presence of the "ever greater" God.101
Adoration of the thrice-holy and sovereign God of love blends with
humility and gives assurance to our supplications.

II. Prayer of Petition
2629 The vocabulary of supplication in the New Testament is rich in
shades of meaning: ask, beseech, plead, invoke, entreat, cry out, even
"struggle in prayer."102 Its most usual form, because the most
spontaneous, is petition: by prayer of petition we express awareness of
our relationship with God. We are creatures who are not our own
beginning, not the masters of adversity, not our own last end. We are
sinners who as Christians know that we have turned away from our
Father. Our petition is already a turning back to him.
2630 The New Testament contains scarcely any prayers of lamentation,
so frequent in the Old Testament. In the risen Christ the Church's
petition is buoyed by hope, even if we still wait in a state of expectation
and must be converted anew every day. Christian petition, what St.
Paul calls {"groaning," arises from another depth, that of creation "in
labor pains" and that of ourselves "as we wait for the redemption of our
bodies.
For in this hope we were saved."103 In the end, however, "with sighs
too deep for words" the Holy Spirit "helps us in our weakness; for we
do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes
for us with sighs too deep for words."104
2631 The first movement of the prayer of petition is asking forgiveness,
like the tax collector in the parable: "God, be merciful to me a
sinner!"105 It is a prerequisite for righteous and pure prayer. A trusting
humility brings us back into the light of communion between the
Father and his Son Jesus Christ and with one another, so that "we
receive from him whatever we ask."106 Asking forgiveness is the
prerequisite for both the Eucharistic liturgy and personal prayer.
2632 Christian petition is centered on the desire and search for the
Kingdom to come, in keeping with the teaching of Christ.107 There is
a hierarchy in these petitions: we pray first for the Kingdom, then for
what is necessary to welcome it and cooperate with its coming. This
collaboration with the mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit, which is
now that of the Church, is the object of the prayer of the apostolic
community.108 It is the prayer of Paul, the apostle par excellence,
which reveals to us how the divine solicitude for all the churches ought
to inspire Christian prayer.109 By prayer every baptized person works
for the coming of the Kingdom.
2633 When we share in God's saving love, we understand that every
need can become the object of petition. Christ, who assumed all things
in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask the Father in
his name.110 It is with this confidence that St. James and St. Paul
exhort us to pray at all times.111

III. Prayer of Intercession
2634 Intercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray as Jesus
did. He is the one intercessor with the Father on behalf of all men,
especially sinners.112 He is "able for all time to save those who draw
near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for
them."113 The Holy Spirit "himself intercedes for us . . . and
intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."114
2635 Since Abraham, intercession - asking on behalf of another has
been characteristic of a heart attuned to God's mercy. In the age of the
Church, Christian intercession participates in Christ's, as an expression
of the communion of saints. In intercession, he who prays looks "not
only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others," even to
the point of praying for those who do him harm.115
2636 The first Christian communities lived this form of fellowship
intensely.116 Thus the Apostle Paul gives them a share in his ministry
of preaching the Gospel117 but also intercedes for them.118 The
intercession of Christians recognizes no boundaries: "for all men, for
kings and all who are in high positions," for persecutors, for the
salvation of those who reject the Gospel.119

IV. Prayer of Thanksgiving
2637 Thanksgiving characterizes the prayer of the Church which, in
celebrating the Eucharist, reveals and becomes more fully what she is.
Indeed, in the work of salvation, Christ sets creation free from sin and
death to consecrate it anew and make it return to the Father, for his
glory. the thanksgiving of the members of the Body participates in that
of their Head.
2638 As in the prayer of petition, every event and need can become an
offering of thanksgiving. the letters of St. Paul often begin and end
with thanksgiving, and the Lord Jesus is always present in it: "Give
thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
for you"; "Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with
thanksgiving."120

V. Prayer of Praise
2639 Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately
that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory,
quite beyond what he does, but simply because HE IS. It shares in the
blessed happiness of the pure of heart who love God in faith before
seeing him in glory. By praise, the Spirit is joined to our spirits to bear
witness that we are children of God,121 testifying to the only Son in
whom we are adopted and by whom we glorify the Father. Praise
embraces the other forms of prayer and carries them toward him who
is its source and goal: the "one God, the Father, from whom are all
things and for whom we exist."122
2640 St. Luke in his gospel often expresses wonder and praise at the
marvels of Christ and in his Acts of the Apostles stresses them as
actions of the Holy Spirit: the community of Jerusalem, the invalid
healed by Peter and John, the crowd that gives glory to God for that,
and the pagans of Pisidia who "were glad and glorified the word of
God."123
2641 "[Address] one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart."124 Like
the inspired writers of the New Testament, the first Christian
communities read the Book of Psalms in a new way, singing in it the
mystery of Christ. In the newness of the Spirit, they also composed
hymns and canticles in the light of the unheard - of event that God
accomplished in his Son: his Incarnation, his death which conquered
death, his Resurrection, and Ascension to the right hand of the
Father.125 Doxology, the praise of God, arises from this "marvelous
work" of the whole economy of salvation.126
2642 The Revelation of "what must soon take place," the Apocalypse,
is borne along by the songs of the heavenly liturgy127 but also by the
intercession of the "witnesses" (martyrs).128 The prophets and the
saints, all those who were slain on earth for their witness to Jesus, the
vast throng of those who, having come through the great tribulation,
have gone before us into the Kingdom, all sing the praise and glory of
him who sits on the throne, and of the Lamb.129 In communion with
them, the Church on earth also sings these songs with faith in the
midst of trial. By means of petition and intercession, faith hopes
against all hope and gives thanks to the "Father of lights," from whom
"every perfect gift" comes down.130 Thus faith is pure praise.
2643 The Eucharist contains and expresses all forms of prayer: it is
"the pure offering" of the whole Body of Christ to the glory of God's
name131 and, according to the traditions of East and West, it is the
"sacrifice of praise."

UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER
Article 3 IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH




IN BRIEF
2644 The Holy Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls to her all
that Jesus said also instructs her in the life of prayer, inspiring new
expressions of the same basic forms of rayer: blessing, petition,
intercession, thanksgiving, and praise.
2645 Because God blesses the human heart, it can in return bless him
who is the source of every blessing.
2646 Forgiveness, the quest for the Kingdom, and every true need are
objects of the prayer of petition.
2647 Prayer of intercession consists in asking on behalf of another. It
knows no boundaries and extends to one's enemies.
2648 Every joy and suffering, every event and need can become the
matter for thanksgiving which, sharing in that of Christ, should fill
one's whole life: "Give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thess 5:18).
2649 Prayer of praise is entirely disinterested and rises to God, lauds
him, and gives him glory for his own sake, quite beyond what he has
done, but simply because HE IS.

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER
2650 Prayer cannot be reduced to the spontaneous outpouring of
interior impulse: in order to pray, one must have the will to pray. Nor is
it enough to know what the Scriptures reveal about prayer: one must
also learn how to pray. Through a living transmission (Sacred
Tradition) within "the believing and praying Church,"1 The Holy
Spirit teaches the children of God how to pray.
2651 The tradition of Christian prayer is one of the ways in which the
tradition of faith takes shape and grows, especially through the
contemplation and study of believers who treasure in their hearts the
events and words of the economy of salvation, and through their
profound grasp of the spiritual realities they experience.2

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER




Article 1 AT THE WELLSPRINGS OF PRAYER
2652 The Holy Spirit is the living water "welling up to eternal life"3 in
the heart that prays. It is he who teaches us to accept it at its source:
Christ. Indeed in the Christian life there are several wellsprings where
Christ awaits us to enable us to drink of the Holy Spirit.
The Word of God
2653 The Church "forcefully and specially exhorts all the Christian
faithful . . . to learn 'the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ' (? Phil
3:8) by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures.... Let them
remember, however, that prayer should accompany the reading of
Sacred Scripture, so that a dialogue takes place between God and man.
For 'we speak to him when we pray; we listen to him when we read the
divine oracles."'4
2654 The spiritual writers, paraphrasing Matthew 7:7, summarize in
this way the dispositions of the heart nourished by the word of God in
prayer "Seek in reading and you will find in meditating; knock in
mental prayer and it will be opened to you by contemplation."5
The Liturgy of the Church
2655 In the sacramental liturgy of the Church, the mission of Christ
and of the Holy Spirit proclaims, makes present, and communicates
the mystery of salvation, which is continued in the heart that prays. the
spiritual writers sometimes compare the heart to an altar. Prayer
internalizes and assimilates the liturgy during and after its celebration.
Even when it is lived out "in secret,"6 prayer is always prayer of the
Church; it is a communion with the Holy Trinity.7
The theological virtues
2656 One enters into prayer as one enters into liturgy: by the narrow
gate of faith. Through the signs of his presence, it is the Face of the
Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to hear and
keep.
2657 The Holy Spirit, who instructs us to celebrate the liturgy in
expectation of Christ's return, teaches us - to pray in hope. Conversely,
the prayer of the Church and personal prayer nourish hope in us. the
psalms especially, with their concrete and varied language, teach us to
fix our hope in God: "I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to
me and heard my cry."8 As St. Paul prayed: "May the God of hope fill
you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the
Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."9
2658 "Hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been
poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."10
Prayer, formed by the liturgical life, draws everything into the love by
which we are loved in Christ and which enables us to respond to him
by loving as he has loved us. Love is the source of prayer; whoever
draws from it reaches the summit of prayer. In the words of the Cure
of Ars:
I love you, O my God, and my only desire is to love you until the last
breath of my life. I love you, O my infinitely lovable God, and I would
rather die loving you, than live without loving you. I love you, Lord,
and the only grace I ask is to love you eternally.... My God, if my
tongue cannot say in every moment that I love you, I want my heart to
repeat it to you as often as I draw breath.11
"Today"
2659 We learn to pray at certain moments by hearing the Word of the
Lord and sharing in his Paschal mystery, but his Spirit is offered us at
all times, in the events of each day, to make prayer spring up from us.
Jesus' teaching about praying to our Father is in the same vein as his
teaching about providence:12 time is in the Father's hands; it is in the
present that we encounter him, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today:
"O that today you would hearken to his voice! Harden not your
hearts."13
2660 Prayer in the events of each day and each moment is one of the
secrets of the kingdom revealed to "little children," to the servants of
Christ, to the poor of the Beatitudes. It is right and good to pray so
that the coming of the kingdom of justice and peace may influence the
march of history, but it is just as important to bring the help of prayer
into humble, everyday situations; all forms of prayer can be the leaven
to which the Lord compares the kingdom.14

Article 2 THE WAY OF PRAYER
2663 In the living tradition of prayer, each Church proposes to its
faithful, according to its historic, social, and cultural context, a
language for prayer: words, melodies, gestures, iconography. the
Magisterium of the Church15 has the task of discerning the fidelity of
these ways of praying to the tradition of apostolic faith; it is for pastors
and catechists to explain their meaning, always in relation to Jesus
Christ.
Prayer to the Father
2664 There is no other way of Christian prayer than Christ. Whether
our prayer is communal or personal, vocal or interior, it has access to
the Father only if we pray "in the name" of Jesus. the sacred humanity
of Jesus is therefore the way by which the Holy Spirit teaches us to
pray to God our Father.
Prayer to Jesus
2665 The prayer of the Church, nourished by the Word of God and the
celebration of the liturgy, teaches us to pray to the Lord Jesus. Even
though her prayer is addressed above all to the Father, it includes in all
the liturgical traditions forms of prayer addressed to Christ. Certain
psalms, given their use in the Prayer of the Church, and the New
Testament place on our lips and engrave in our hearts prayer to Christ
in the form of invocations: Son of God, Word of God, Lord, Savior,
Lamb of God, King, Beloved Son, Son of the Virgin, Good Shepherd,
our Life, our Light, our Hope, our Resurrection, Friend of mankind....
2666 But the one name that contains everything is the one that the
Son of God received in his incarnation: JESUS. the divine name may
not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our humanity the Word
of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: "Jesus," "YHWH
saves."16 The name "Jesus" contains all: God and man and the whole
economy of creation and salvation. To pray "Jesus" is to invoke him and
to call him within us. His name is the only one that contains the
presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the
name of Jesus is welcoming the Son of God who loved him and who
gave himself up for him.17
2667 This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of
prayer under many forms in East and West. the most usual
formulation, transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and
Mt. Athos, is the invocation, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have
mercy on us sinners." It combines the Christological hymn of
Philippians 2:6-11 with the cry of the publican and the blind men
begging for light.18 By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness
and the Savior's mercy.
2668 The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of
praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly
attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases,19
but holds fast to the word and "brings forth fruit with patience."20
This prayer is possible "at all times" because it is not one occupation
among others but the only occupation: that of loving God, which
animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus.
2669 The prayer of the Church venerates and honors the Heart of
Jesus just as it invokes his most holy name. It adores the incarnate
Word and his Heart which, out of love for men, he allowed to be
pierced by our sins. Christian prayer loves to follow the way of the
cross in the Savior's steps. the stations from the Praetorium to
Golgotha and the tomb trace the way of Jesus, who by his holy Cross
has redeemed the world.
"Come, Holy Spirit"
2670 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit."21
Every time we begin to pray to Jesus it is the Holy Spirit who draws us
on the way of prayer by his prevenient grace. Since he teaches us to
pray by recalling Christ, how could we not pray to the Spirit too? That
is why the Church invites us to call upon the Holy Spirit every day,
especially at the beginning and the end of every important action.
If the Spirit should not be worshiped, how can he divinize me through
Baptism? If he should be worshiped, should he not be the object of
adoration?22
2671 The traditional form of petition to the Holy Spirit is to invoke the
Father through Christ our Lord to give us the Consoler Spirit.23 Jesus
insists on this petition to be made in his name at the very moment
when he promises the gift of the Spirit of Truth.24 But the simplest
and most direct prayer is also traditional, "Come, Holy Spirit," and
every liturgical tradition has developed it in antiphons and hymns.
Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them
the fire of your love.25
Heavenly King, Consoler Spirit, Spirit of Truth, present everywhere
and filling all things, treasure of all good and source of all life, come
dwell in us, cleanse and save us, you who are All Good.26
2672 The Holy Spirit, whose anointing permeates our whole being, is
the interior Master of Christian prayer. He is the artisan of the living
tradition of prayer. To be sure, there are as many paths of prayer as
there are persons who pray, but it is the same Spirit acting in all and
with all. It is in the communion of the Holy Spirit that Christian prayer
is prayer in the Church.
In communion with the holy Mother of God
2673 In prayer the Holy Spirit unites us to the person of the only Son,
in his glorified humanity, through which and in which our filial prayer
unites us in the Church with the Mother of Jesus.27
2674 Mary gave her consent in faith at the Annunciation and
maintained it without hesitation at the foot of the Cross. Ever since,
her motherhood has extended to the brothers and sisters of her Son
"who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties."28
Jesus, the only mediator, is the way of our prayer; Mary, his mother
and ours, is wholly transparent to him: she "shows the way"
(hodigitria), and is herself "the Sign" of the way, according to the
traditional iconography of East and West.
2675 Beginning with Mary's unique cooperation with the working of
the Holy Spirit, the Churches developed their prayer to the holy
Mother of God, centering it on the person of Christ manifested in his
mysteries. In countless hymns and antiphons expressing this prayer,
two movements usually alternate with one another: the first
"magnifies" the Lord for the "great things" he did for his lowly servant
and through her for all human beings29 The second entrusts the
supplications and praises of the children of God to the Mother of
Jesus, because she now knows the humanity which, in her, the Son of
God espoused.
2676 This twofold movement of prayer to Mary has found a privileged
expression in the Ave Maria:
Hail Mary [or Rejoice, Mary]: the greeting of the angel Gabriel opens
this prayer. It is God himself who, through his angel as intermediary,
greets Mary. Our prayer dares to take up this greeting to Mary with the
regard God had for the lowliness of his humble servant and to exult in
the joy he finds in her.30
Full of grace, the Lord is with thee: These two phrases of the angel's
greeting shed light on one another. Mary is full of grace because the
Lord is with her. the grace with which she is filled is the presence of
him who is the source of all grace. "Rejoice . . . O Daughter of
Jerusalem . . . the Lord your God is in your midst."31 Mary, in whom
the Lord himself has just made his dwelling, is the daughter of Zion in
person, the ark of the covenant, the place where the glory of the Lord
dwells. She is "the dwelling of God . . . with men."32 Full of grace,
Mary is wholly given over to him who has come to dwell in her and
whom she is about to give to the world.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus. After the angel's greeting, we make Elizabeth's greeting our own.
"Filled with the Holy Spirit," Elizabeth is the first in the long
succession of generations who have called Mary "blessed."33 "Blessed
is she who believed...."34 Mary is "blessed among women" because she
believed in the fulfillment of the Lord's word. Abraham. because of his
faith, became a blessing for all the nations of the earth.35 Mary,
because of her faith, became the mother of believers, through whom all
nations of the earth receive him who is God's own blessing: Jesus, the
"fruit of thy womb."
2677 Holy Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, "and why
is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"36
Because she gives us Jesus, her son, Mary is Mother of God and our
mother; we can entrust all our cares and petitions to her: she prays for
us as she prayed for herself: "Let it be to me according to your
word."37 By entrusting ourselves to her prayer, we abandon ourselves
to the will of God together with her: "Thy will be done."
Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death: By asking Mary
to pray for us, we acknowledge ourselves to be poor sinners and we
address ourselves to the "Mother of Mercy," the All-Holy One. We give
ourselves over to her now, in the Today of our lives. and our trust
broadens further, already at the present moment, to surrender "the
hour of our death" wholly to her care. May she be there as she was at
her son's death on the cross. May she welcome us as our mother at the
hour of our passing38 to lead us to her son, Jesus, in paradise.
2678 Medieval piety in the West developed the prayer of the rosary as a
popular substitute for the Liturgy of the Hours. In the East, the litany
called the Akathistos and the Paraclesis remained closer to the choral
office in the Byzantine churches, while the Armenian, Coptic, and
Syriac traditions preferred popular hymns and songs to the Mother of
God. But in the Ave Maria, the theotokia, the hymns of St. Ephrem or
St. Gregory of Narek, the tradition of prayer is basically the same.
2679 Mary is the perfect Orans (prayer), a figure of the Church. When
we pray to her, we are adhering with her to the plan of the Father, who
sends his Son to save all men. Like the beloved disciple we welcome
Jesus' mother into our homes,39 for she has become the mother of all
the living. We can pray with and to her. the prayer of the Church is
sustained by the prayer of Mary and united with it in hope.40

Article 2 THE WAY OF PRAYER




IN BRIEF
2680 Prayer is primarily addressed to the Father; it can also be
directed toward Jesus, particularly by the invocation of his holy name:
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners."
2681 "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor
12:3). the Church invites us to invoke the Holy Spirit as the interior
Teacher of Christian prayer.
2682 Because of Mary's singular cooperation with the action of the
Holy Spirit, the Church loves to pray in communion with the Virgin
Mary, to magnify with her the great things the Lord has done for her,
and to entrust supplications and praises to her.

CHAPTER TWO THE TRADITION OF PRAYER
Article 3 GUIDES FOR PRAYER
A cloud of witnesses
2683 The witnesses who have preceded us into the kingdom,41
especially those whom the Church recognizes as saints, share in the
living tradition of prayer by the example of their lives, the transmission
of their writings, and their prayer today. They contemplate God, praise
him and constantly care for those whom they have left on earth. When
they entered into the joy of their Master, they were "put in charge of
many things."42 Their intercession is their most exalted service to
God's plan. We can and should ask them to intercede for us and for the
whole world.
2684 In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities have
been developed throughout the history of the churches. the personal
charism of some witnesses to God's love for men has been handed on,
like "the spirit" of Elijah to Elisha and John the Baptist, so that their
followers may have a share in this spirit.43 A distinct spirituality can
also arise at the point of convergence of liturgical and theological
currents, bearing witness to the integration of the faith into a particular
human environment and its history. the different schools of Christian
spirituality share in the living tradition of prayer and are essential
guides for the faithful. In their rich diversity they are refractions of the
one pure light of the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit is truly the dwelling of the saints and the saints are for the
Spirit a place where he dwells as in his own home since they offer
themselves as a dwelling place for God and are called his temple.44
Servants of prayer
2685 The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer.
Based on the sacrament of marriage, the family is the "domestic
church" where God's children learn to pray "as the Church" and to
persevere in prayer. For young children in particular, daily family
prayer is the first witness of the Church's living memory as awakened
patiently by the Holy Spirit.
2686 Ordained ministers are also responsible for the formation in
prayer of their brothers and sisters in Christ. Servants of the Good
Shepherd, they are ordained to lead the People of God to the living
waters of prayer: the Word of God, the liturgy, the theological life (the
life of faith, hope, and charity), and the Today of God in concrete
situations.45
2687 Many religious have consecrated their whole lives to prayer.
Hermits, monks, and nuns since the time of the desert fathers have
devoted their time to praising God and interceding for his people. the
consecrated life cannot be sustained or spread without prayer; it is one
of the living sources of contemplation and the spiritual life of the
Church.
2688 The catechesis of children, young people, and adults aims at
teaching them to meditate on the Word of God in personal prayer,
practicing it in liturgical prayer, and internalizing it at all times in order
to bear fruit in a new life. Catechesis is also a time for the discernment
and education of popular piety.46 The memorization of basic prayers
offers an essential support to the life of prayer, but it is important to
help learners savor their meaning.
2689 Prayer groups, indeed "schools of prayer," are today one of the
signs and one of the driving forces of renewal of prayer in the Church,
provided they drink from authentic wellsprings of Christian prayer.
Concern for ecclesial communion is a sign of true prayer in the
Church.
2690 The Holy Spirit gives to certain of the faithful the gifts of
wisdom, faith and discernment for the sake of this common good
which is prayer (spiritual direction). Men and women so endowed are
true servants of the living tradition of prayer.
According to St. John of the Cross, the person wishing to advance
toward perfection should "take care into whose hands he entrusts
himself, for as the master is, so will the disciple be, and as the father is
so will be the son." and further: "In addition to being learned and
discreet a director should be experienced.... If the spiritual director has
no experience of the spiritual life, he will be incapable of leading into it
the souls whom God is calling to it, and he will not even understand
them."47
Places favorable for prayer
2691 The church, the house of God, is the proper place for the
liturgical prayer of the parish community. It is also the privileged place
for adoration of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.
the choice of a favorable place is not a matter of indifference for true
prayer.
- For personal prayer, this can be a "prayer corner" with the Sacred
Scriptures and icons, in order to be there, in secret, before our
Father.48 In a Christian family, this kind of little oratory fosters prayer
in common.
- In regions where monasteries exist, the vocation of these
communities is to further the participation of the faithful in the Liturgy
of the Hours and to provide necessary solitude for more intense
personal prayer.49
- Pilgrimages evoke our earthly journey toward heaven and are
traditionally very special occasions for renewal in prayer. For pilgrims
seeking living water, shrines are special places for living the forms of
Christian prayer "in Church."

Article 3 GUIDES FOR PRAYER




IN BRIEF
2692 In prayer, the pilgrim Church is associated with that of the saints,
whose intercession she asks.
2693 The different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living
tradition of prayer and are precious guides for the spiritual life.
2694 The Christian family is the first place for education in prayer.
2695 Ordained ministers, the consecrated life, catechesis, prayer
groups, and "spiritual direction" ensure assistance within the Church
in the practice of prayer.
2696 The most appropriate places for prayer are personal or family
oratories, monasteries, places of pilgrimage, and above all the church,
which is the proper place for liturgical prayer for the parish community
and the privileged place for Eucharistic adoration.

CHAPTER THREE THE LIFE OF PRAYER
2697 Prayer is the life of the new heart. It ought to animate us at every
moment. But we tend to forget him who is our life and our all. This is
why the Fathers of the spiritual life in the Deuteronomic and prophetic
traditions insist that prayer is a remembrance of God often awakened
by the memory of the heart "We must remember God more often than
we draw breath."1 But we cannot pray "at all times" if we do not pray
at specific times, consciously willing it These are the special times of
Christian prayer, both in intensity and duration.
2698 The Tradition of the Church proposes to the faithful certain
rhythms of praying intended to nourish continual prayer. Some are
daily, such as morning and evening prayer, grace before and after
meals, the Liturgy of the Hours. Sundays, centered on the Eucharist,
are kept holy primarily by prayer. the cycle of the liturgical year and its
great feasts are also basic rhythms of the Christian's life of prayer.
2699 The Lord leads all persons by paths and in ways pleasing to him,
and each believer responds according to his heart's resolve and the
personal expressions of his prayer. However, Christian Tradition has
retained three major expressions of prayer: vocal meditative, and
contemplative. They have one basic trait in common: composure of
heart. This vigilance in keeping the Word and dwelling in the presence
of God makes these three expressions intense times in the life of
prayer.

Article 1 EXPRESSIONS OF PRAYER
I. Vocal prayer
2700 Through his Word, God speaks to man. By words, mental or
vocal, our prayer takes flesh. Yet it is most important that the heart
should be present to him to whom we are speaking in prayer: "Whether
or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number of words, but on
the fervor of our souls."2
2701 Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his
disciples, drawn by their Master's silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal
prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the liturgical prayers
of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to
express his personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the
agony of Gesthemani.3
2702 The need to involve the senses in interior prayer corresponds to a
requirement of our human nature. We are body and spirit, and we
experience the need to translate our feelings externally. We must pray
with our whole being to give all power possible to our supplication.
2703 This need also corresponds to a divine requirement. God seeks
worshippers in Spirit and in Truth, and consequently living prayer that
rises from the depths of the soul. He also wants the external expression
that associates the body with interior prayer, for it renders him that
perfect homage which is his due.
2704 Because it is external and so thoroughly human, vocal prayer is
the form of prayer most readily accessible to groups. Even interior
prayer, however, cannot neglect vocal prayer. Prayer is internalized to
the extent that we become aware of him "to whom we speak;"4 Thus
vocal prayer becomes an initial form of contemplative prayer.

II. Meditation
2705 Meditation is above all a quest. the mind seeks to understand the
why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to
what the Lord is asking. the required attentiveness is difficult to
sustain. We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want for
them: the Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons,
liturgical texts of the day or season, writings of the spiritual fathers,
works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history the
page on which the "today" of God is written.
2706 To meditate on what we read helps us to make it our own by
confronting it with ourselves. Here, another book is opened: the book
of life. We pass from thoughts to reality. To the extent that we are
humble and faithful, we discover in meditation the movements that stir
the heart and we are able to discern them. It is a question of acting
truthfully in order to come into the light: "Lord, what do you want me
to do?"
2707 There are as many and varied methods of meditation as there are
spiritual masters. Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire
to meditate regularly, lest they come to resemble the three first kinds of
soil in the parable of the sower.5 But a method is only a guide; the
important thing is to advance, with the Holy Spirit, along the one way
of prayer: Christ Jesus.
2708 Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire.
This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our
convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and
strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to
meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary.
This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer
should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to
union with him.

III. Contemplative Prayer
2709 What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: "Contemplative
prayer [oracion mental] in my opinion is nothing else than a close
sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone
with him who we know loves us."6
Contemplative prayer seeks him "whom my soul loves."7 It is Jesus,
and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always
the beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes
us to be born of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still
meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself.
2710 The choice of the time and duration of the prayer arises from a
determined will, revealing the secrets of the heart. One does not
undertake contemplative prayer only when one has the time: one
makes time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give up,
no matter what trials and dryness one may encounter. One cannot
always meditate, but one can always enter into inner prayer,
independently of the conditions of health, work, or emotional state. the
heart is the place of this quest and encounter, in poverty ant in faith.
2711 Entering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the
Eucharistic liturgy: we "gather up:" the heart, recollect our whole being
under the prompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the dwelling place of
the Lord which we are, awaken our faith in order to enter into the
presence of him who awaits us. We let our masks fall and turn our
hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as to hand ourselves over to
him as an offering to be purified and transformed.
2712 Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the
forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved
and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.8 But he knows
that the love he is returning is poured out by the Spirit in his heart, for
everything is grace from God. Contemplative prayer is the poor and
humble surrender to the loving will of the Father in ever deeper union
with his beloved Son.
2713 Contemplative prayer is the simplest expression of the mystery of
prayer. It is a gift, a grace; it can be accepted only in humility and
poverty. Contemplative prayer is a covenant relationship established by
God within our hearts.9 Contemplative prayer is a communion in
which the Holy Trinity conforms man, the image of God, "to his
likeness."
2714 Contemplative prayer is also the pre-eminently intense time of
prayer. In it the Father strengthens our inner being with power through
his Spirit "that Christ may dwell in (our) hearts through faith" and we
may be "grounded in love."10
2715 Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. "I look at him
and he looks at me": this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of
his holy curé used to say while praying before the tabernacle. This
focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the
light of the countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and
teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth and his compassion
for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the
life of Christ. Thus it learns the "interior knowledge of our Lord," the
more to love him and follow him.11
2716 Contemplative prayer is hearing the Word of God. Far from being
passive, such attentiveness is the obedience of faith, the unconditional
acceptance of a servant, and the loving commitment of a child. It
participates in the "Yes" of the Son become servant and the Fiat of
God's lowly handmaid.
2717 Contemplative prayer is silence, the "symbol of the world to
come"12 or "silent love."13 Words in this kind of prayer are not
speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love. In this
silence, unbearable to the "outer" man, the Father speaks to us his
incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit
of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus.
2718 Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ insofar
as it makes us participate in his mystery. the mystery of Christ is
celebrated by the Church in the Eucharist, and the Holy Spirit makes
it come alive in contemplative prayer so that our charity will manifest it
in our acts.
2719 Contemplative prayer is a communion of love bearing Life for
the multitude, to the extent that it consents to abide in the night of
faith. the Paschal night of the Resurrection passes through the night of
the agony and the tomb - the three intense moments of the Hour of
Jesus which his Spirit (and not "the flesh [which] is weak") brings to
life in prayer. We must be willing to "keep watch with (him) one
hour."14

Article 1 EXPRESSIONS OF PRAYER
IN BRIEF
2720 The Church invites the faithful to regular prayer: daily prayers,
the Liturgy of the Hours, Sunday Eucharist, the feasts of the liturgical
year.
2721 The Christian tradition comprises three major expressions of the
life of prayer: vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplative prayer. They
have in common the recollection of the heart.
2722 Vocal prayer, founded on the union of body and soul in human
nature, associates the body with the interior prayer of the heart,
following Christ's example of praying to his Father and teaching the
Our Father to his disciples.
2723 Meditation is a prayerful quest engaging thought, imagination,
emotion, and desire. Its goal is to make our own in faith the subject
considered, by confronting it with the reality of our own life.
2724 Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of
prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus, an attentiveness to the Word
of God, a silent love. It achieves real union with the prayer of Christ to
the extent that it makes us share in his mystery.

Article 2 THE BATTLE OF PRAYER
2725 Prayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our
part. It always presupposes effort. the great figures of prayer of the Old
Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, the saints, and
he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against
ourselves and against the wiles of the tempter who does all he can to
turn man away from prayer, away from union with God. We pray as we
live, because we live as we pray. If we do not want to act habitually
according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray habitually in his
name. the "spiritual battle" of the Christian's new life is inseparable
from the battle of prayer.

Article 2 THE BATTLE OF PRAYER




I. Objections to Prayer
2726 In the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and around us
erroneous notions of prayer. Some people view prayer as a simple
psychological activity, others as an effort of concentration to reach a
mental void. Still others reduce prayer to ritual words and postures.
Many Christians unconsciously regard prayer as an occupation that is
incompatible with all the other things they have to do: they "don't have
the time." Those who seek God by prayer are quickly discouraged
because they do not know that prayer comes also from the Holy Spirit
and not from themselves alone.
2727 We must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving from the
mentality of "this present world" can penetrate our lives if we are not
vigilant. For example, some would have it that only that is true which
can be verified by reason and science; yet prayer is a mystery that
overflows both our conscious and unconscious lives. Others overly
prize production and profit; thus prayer, being unproductive, is useless.
Still others exalt sensuality and comfort as the criteria of the true, the
good, and the beautiful; whereas prayer, the "love of beauty"
(philokalia), is caught up in the glory of the living and true God.
Finally, some see prayer as a flight from the world in reaction against
activism; but in fact, Christian prayer is neither an escape from reality
nor a divorce from life.
2728 Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as failure
in prayer: discouragement during periods of dryness; sadness that,
because we have "great possessions,"15 we have not given all to the
Lord; disappointment over not being heard according to our own will;
wounded pride, stiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our
resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and unmerited gift; and so
forth. the conclusion is always the same: what good does it do to pray?
To overcome these obstacles, we must battle to gain humility, trust,
and perseverance.

II. Humble Vigilance of Heart
Facing difficulties in prayer
2729 The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect words
and their meaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more profoundly,
him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or personal),
meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set about hunting down
distractions would be to fall into their trap, when all that is necessary is
to turn back to our heart: for a distraction reveals to us what we are
attached to, and this humble awareness before the Lord should awaken
our preferential love for him and lead us resolutely to offer him our
heart to be purified. Therein lies the battle, the choice of which master
to serve.16
2730 In positive terms, the battle against the possessive and
dominating self requires vigilance, sobriety of heart. When Jesus insists
on vigilance, he always relates it to himself, to his coming on the last
day and every day: today. the bridegroom comes in the middle of the
night; the light that must not be extinguished is that of faith: "'Come,'
my heart says, 'seek his face!'"17
2731 Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray,
is dryness. Dryness belongs to contemplative prayer when the heart is
separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, memories, and
feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer faith clinging
faithfully to Jesus in his agony and in his tomb. "Unless a grain of
wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if dies, it bears
much fruit."18 If dryness is due to the lack of roots, because the word
has fallen on rocky soil, the battle requires conversion.19
Facing temptations in prayer
2732 The most common yet most hidden temptation is our lack of
faith. It expresses itself less by declared incredulity than by our actual
preferences. When we begin to pray, a thousand labors or cares thought
to be urgent vie for priority; once again, it is the moment of truth for
the heart: what is its real love? Sometimes we turn to the Lord as a last
resort, but do we really believe he is? Sometimes we enlist the Lord as
an ally, but our heart remains presumptuous. In each case, our lack of
faith reveals that we do not yet share in the disposition of a humble
heart:
"Apart from me, you can do nothing."20
2733 Another temptation, to which presumption opens the gate, is
acedia. the spiritual writers understand by this a form of depression
due to lax ascetical practice, decreasing vigilance, carelessness of heart.
"The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."21 The greater the
height, the harder the fall. Painful as discouragement is, it is the reverse
of presumption. the humble are not surprised by their distress; it leads
them to trust more, to hold fast in constancy.

III. Filial Trust
2734 Filial trust is tested - it proves itself - in tribulation.22 The
principal difficulty concerns the prayer of petition, for oneself or for
others in intercession. Some even stop praying because they think their
petition is not heard. Here two questions should be asked: Why do we
think our petition has not been heard? How is our prayer heard, how is
it "efficacious"?
Why do we complain of not being heard?
2735 In the first place, we ought to be astonished by this fact: when we
praise God or give him thanks for his benefits in general, we are not
particularly concerned whether or not our prayer is acceptable to him.
On the other hand, we demand to see the results of our petitions. What
is the image of God that motivates our prayer: an instrument to be
used? or the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ?
2736 Are we convinced that "we do not know how to pray as we
ought"?23 Are we asking God for "what is good for us"? Our Father
knows what we need before we ask him,24 but he awaits our petition
because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom. We must pray,
then, with his Spirit of freedom, to be able truly to know what he
wants.25
2737 "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it
on your passions."26 If we ask with a divided heart, we are
"adulterers";27 God cannot answer us, for he desires our well-being,
our life. "Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the scripture says,
'He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to dwell in
us?'"28 That our God is "jealous" for us is the sign of how true his love
is. If we enter into the desire of his Spirit, we shall be heard.
Do not be troubled if you do not immediately receive from God what
you ask him; for he desires to do something even greater for you, while
you cling to him in prayer.29
God wills that our desire should be exercised in prayer, that we may be
able to receive what he is prepared to give.30
How is our prayer efficacious?
2738 The revelation of prayer in the economy of salvation teaches us
that faith rests on God's action in history. Our filial trust is enkindled
by his supreme act: the Passion and Resurrection of his Son. Christian
prayer is cooperation with his providence, his plan of love for men.
2739 For St. Paul, this trust is bold, founded on the prayer of the Spirit
in us and on the faithful love of the Father who has given us his only
Son.31 Transformation of the praying heart is the first response to our
petition.
2740 The prayer of Jesus makes Christian prayer an efficacious
petition. He is its model, he prays in us and with us. Since the heart of
the Son seeks only what pleases the Father, how could the prayer of the
children of adoption be centered on the gifts rather than the Giver?
2741 Jesus also prays for us - in our place and on our behalf. All our
petitions were gathered up, once for all, in his cry on the Cross and, in
his Resurrection, heard by the Father. This is why he never ceases to
intercede for us with the Father.32 If our prayer is resolutely united
with that of Jesus, in trust and boldness as children, we obtain all that
we ask in his name, even more than any particular thing: the Holy
Spirit himself, who contains all gifts.

IV. Perservering in Love
2742 "Pray constantly . . . always and for everything giving thanks in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father."33 St. Paul
adds, "Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication.
To that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all
the saints."34 For "we have not been commanded to work, to keep
watch and to fast constantly, but it has been laid down that we are to
pray without ceasing."35 This tireless fervor can come only from love.
Against our dullness and laziness, the battle of prayer is that of humble,
trusting, and persevering love. This love opens our hearts to three
enlightening and life-giving facts of faith about prayer.
2743 It is always possible to pray: the time of the Christian is that of
the risen Christ who is with us always, no matter what tempests may
arise.36 Our time is in the hands of God:
It is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public or
strolling alone, or seated in your shop, . . . while buying or selling, . . .
or even while cooking.37
2744 Prayer is a vital necessity. Proof from the contrary is no less
convincing: if we do not allow the Spirit to lead us, we fall back into
the slavery of sin.38 How can the Holy Spirit be our life if our heart is
far from him?
Nothing is equal to prayer; for what is impossible it makes possible,
what is difficult, easy.... For it is impossible, utterly impossible, for the
man who prays eagerly and invokes God ceaselessly ever to sin.39


Those who pray are certainly saved; those who do not pray are
certainly damned40
2745 Prayer and Christian life are inseparable, for they concern the
same love and the same renunciation, proceeding from love; the same
filial and loving conformity with the Father's plan of love; the same
transforming union in the Holy Spirit who conforms us more and
more to Christ Jesus; the same love for all men, the love with which
Jesus has loved us. "Whatever you ask the Father in my name, he [will]
give it to you. This I command you, to love one another."41
He "prays without ceasing" who unites prayer to works and good works
to prayer. Only in this way can we consider as realizable the principle
of praying without ceasing.42

Article 3 THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS
2746 When "his hour" came, Jesus prayed to the Father.43 His prayer,
the longest transmitted by the Gospel, embraces the whole economy of
creation and salvation, as well as his death and Resurrection. the prayer
of the Hour of Jesus always remains his own, just as his Passover "once
for all" remains ever present in the liturgy of his Church.
2747 Christian Tradition rightly calls this prayer the "priestly" prayer of
Jesus. It is the prayer of our high priest, inseparable from his sacrifice,
from his passing over (Passover) to the Father to whom he is wholly
"consecrated."44
2748 In this Paschal and sacrificial prayer, everything is recapitulated
in Christ:45 God and the world; the Word and the flesh; eternal life
and time; the love that hands itself over and the sin that betrays it; the
disciples present and those who will believe in him by their word;
humiliation and glory. It is the prayer of unity.
2749 Jesus fulfilled the work of the Father completely; his prayer, like
his sacrifice, extends until the end of time. the prayer of this hour fills
the end-times and carries them toward their consummation. Jesus, the
Son to whom the Father has given all things, has given himself wholly
back to the Father, yet expresses himself with a sovereign freedom46
by virtue of the power the Father has given him over all flesh. the Son,
who made himself Servant, is Lord, the Pantocrator. Our high priest
who prays for us is also the one who prays in us and the God who
hears our prayer.
2750 By entering into the holy name of the Lord Jesus we can accept,
from within, the prayer he teaches us: "Our Father!" His priestly prayer
fulfills, from within, the great petitions of the Lord's Prayer: concern
for the Father's name;47 passionate zeal for his kingdom (Glory);48
The accomplishment of the will of the Father, of his plan of
salvation;49 and deliverance from evil.50
2751 Finally, in this prayer Jesus reveals and gives to us the
"knowledge," inseparably one, of the Father and of the Son,51 which is
the very mystery of the life of prayer.

Article 3 THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS




IN BRIEF
2752 Prayer presupposes an effort, a fight against ourselves and the
wiles of the Tempter. the battle of prayer is inseparable from the
necessary "spiritual battle" to act habitually according to the Spirit of
Christ: we pray as we live, because we live as we pray.
2753 In the battle of prayer we must confront erroneous conceptions
of prayer, various currents of thought, and our own experience of
failure. We must respond with humility, trust, and perseverance to
these temptations which cast doubt on the usefulness or even the
possibility of prayer.
2754 The principal difficulties in the practice of prayer are distraction
and dryness. the remedy lies in faith, conversion, and vigilance of
heart.
2755 Two frequent temptations threaten prayer: lack of faith and
acedia - a form of depression stemming from lax ascetical practice that
leads to discouragement.
2756 Filial trust is put to the test when we feel that our prayer is not
always heard. the Gospel invites us to ask ourselves about the
conformity of our prayer to the desire of the Spirit.
2757 "Pray constantly" (1 Thess 5:17). It is always possible to pray. It
is even a vital necessity. Prayer and Christian life are inseparable.
2758 The prayer of the hour of Jesus, rightly called the "priestly prayer"
(cf Jn 17), sums up the whole economy of creation and salvation. It
fulfills the great petitions of the Our Father.

SECTION TWO THE LORD'S PRAYER
I. "OUR FATHER!"
2759 Jesus "was praying at a certain place, and when he ceased, one of
his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his
disciples.'"1 In response to this request the Lord entrusts to his
disciples and to his Church the fundamental Christian prayer. St. Luke
presents a brief text of five petitions,2 while St. Matthew gives a more
developed version of seven petitions.3 The liturgical tradition of the
Church has retained St. Matthew's text:
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil.
2760 Very early on, liturgical usage concluded the Lord's Prayer with a
doxology. In the Didache, we find, "For yours are the power and the
glory for ever."4 The Apostolic Constitutions add to the beginning:
"the kingdom," and this is the formula retained to our day in
ecumenical prayer.5
The Byzantine tradition adds after "the glory" the words "Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit." the Roman Missal develops the last petition in the
explicit perspective of "awaiting our blessed hope" and of the Second
Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.6 Then comes the assembly's
acclamation or the repetition of the doxology from the Apostolic
Constitutions.

2761 The Lord's Prayer "is truly the summary of the whole gospel."7
"Since the Lord . . . after handing over the practice of prayer, said
elsewhere, 'Ask and you will receive,' and since everyone has petitions
which are peculiar to his circumstances, the regular and appropriate
prayer [the Lord's Prayer] is said first, as the foundation of further
desires."8

I. At the Center of the Scriptures
2762 After showing how the psalms are the principal food of Christian
prayer and flow together in the petitions of the Our Father, St.
Augustine concludes:
Run through all the words of the holy prayers [in Scripture], and I do
not think that you will find anything in them that is not contained and
included in the Lord's Prayer.9
2763 All the Scriptures - the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms - are
fulfilled in Christ.10 The Gospel is this "Good News." Its first
proclamation is summarized by St. Matthew in the Sermon on the
Mount;11 The prayer to our Father is at the center of this
proclamation. It is in this context that each petition bequeathed to us
by the Lord is illuminated:
The Lord's Prayer is the most perfect of prayers.... In it we ask, not
only for all the things we can rightly desire, but also in the sequence
that they should be desired. This prayer not only teaches us to ask for
things, but also in what order we should desire them.12
2764 The Sermon on the Mount is teaching for life, the Our Father is
a prayer; but in both the one and the other the Spirit of the Lord gives
new form to our desires, those inner movements that animate our lives.
Jesus teaches us this new life by his words; he teaches us to ask for it by
our prayer. the rightness of our life in him will depend on the rightness
of our prayer.

II. The Lord's Prayer
2765 The traditional expression "the Lord's Prayer" - oratio Dominica
- means that the prayer to our Father is taught and given to us by the
Lord Jesus. the prayer that comes to us from Jesus is truly unique: it is
"of the Lord." On the one hand, in the words of this prayer the only
Son gives us the words the Father gave him:13 he is the master of our
prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he knows in his human heart
the needs of his human brothers and sisters and reveals them to us: he
is the model of our prayer.
2766 But Jesus does not give us a formula to repeat mechanically.14
As in every vocal prayer, it is through the Word of God that the Holy
Spirit teaches the children of God to pray to their Father. Jesus not
only gives us the words of our filial prayer; at the same time he gives us
the Spirit by whom these words become in us "spirit and life."15 Even
more, the proof and possibility of our filial prayer is that the Father
"sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'"16
Since our prayer sets forth our desires before God, it is again the
Father, "he who searches the hearts of men," who "knows what is the
mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints
according to the will of God."17 The prayer to Our Father is inserted
into the mysterious mission of the Son and of the Spirit.

III. The Prayer of the Church
2767 This indivisible gift of the Lord's words and of the Holy Spirit
who gives life to them in the hearts of believers has been received and
lived by the Church from the beginning. the first communities prayed
the Lord's Prayer three times a day,18 in place of the "Eighteen
Benedictions" customary in Jewish piety.
2768 According to the apostolic tradition, the Lord's Prayer is
essentially rooted in liturgical prayer:
[The Lord] teaches us to make prayer in common for all our brethren.
For he did not say "my Father" who art in heaven, but "our" Father,
offering petitions for the common body.19
In all the liturgical traditions, the Lord's Prayer is an integral part of
the major hours of the Divine Office. In the three sacraments of
Christian initiation its ecclesial character is especially in evidence:
2769 In Baptism and Confirmation, the handing on (traditio) of the
Lord's Prayer signifies new birth into the divine life. Since Christian
prayer is our speaking to God with the very word of God, those who
are "born anew". . . through the living and abiding word of God"20
learn to invoke their Father by the one Word he always hears. They can
henceforth do so, for the seal of the Holy Spirit's anointing is indelibly
placed on their hearts, ears, lips, indeed their whole filial being. This is
why most of the patristic commentaries on the Our Father are
addressed to catechumens and neophytes. When the Church prays the
Lord's Prayer, it is always the people made up of the "new-born" who
pray and obtain mercy.21
2770 In the Eucharistic liturgy the Lord's Prayer appears as the prayer
of the whole Church and there reveals its full meaning and efficacy.
Placed between the anaphora (the Eucharistic prayer) and the
communion, the Lord's Prayer sums up on the one hand all the
petitions and intercessions expressed in the movement of the epiclesis
and, on the other, knocks at the door of the Banquet of the kingdom
which sacramental communion anticipates.
2771 In the Eucharist, the Lord's Prayer also reveals the eschatological
character of its petitions. It is the proper prayer of "the end-time," the
time of salvation that began with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and
will be fulfilled with the Lord's return. the petitions addressed to our
Father, as distinct from the prayers of the old covenant, rely on the
mystery of salvation already accomplished, once for all, in Christ
crucified and risen.
2772 From this unshakeable faith springs forth the hope that sustains
each of the seven petitions, which express the groanings of the present
age, this time of patience and expectation during which "it does not yet
appear what we shall be."22 The Eucharist and the Lord's Prayer look
eagerly for the Lord's return, "until he comes."23

IN BRIEF
2773 In response to his disciples' request "Lord, teach us to pray" (Lk
11:1), Jesus entrusts them with the fundamental Christian prayer, the
Our Father.
2774 "The Lord's Prayer is truly the summary of the whole gospel,"24
The "most perfect of prayers."25 It is at the center of the Scriptures.
2775 It is called "the Lord's Prayer" because it comes to us from the
Lord Jesus, the master and model of our prayer.
2776 The Lord's Prayer is the quintessential prayer of the Church. It is
an integral part of the major hours of the Divine Office and of the
sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and
Eucharist. Integrated into the Eucharist it reveals the eschatological
character of its petitions, hoping for the Lord, "until he comes" (1 Cor
11:26).

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"
I. "We Dare To Say"
2777 In the Roman liturgy, the Eucharistic assembly is invited to pray
to our heavenly Father with filial boldness; the Eastern liturgies
develop and use similar expressions: "dare in all confidence," "make us
worthy of...." From the burning bush Moses heard a voice saying to
him, "Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the
place on which you are standing is holy ground."26 Only Jesus could
cross that threshold of the divine holiness, for "when he had made
purification for sins," he brought us into the Father's presence: "Here
am I, and the children God has given me."27
Our awareness of our status as slaves would make us sink into the
ground and our earthly condition would dissolve into dust, if the
authority of our Father himself and the Spirit of his Son had not
impelled us to this cry . . . 'Abba, Father!' . . . When would a mortal
dare call God 'Father,' if man's innermost being were not animated by
power from on high?"28
2778 This power of the Spirit who introduces us to the Lord's Prayer is
expressed in the liturgies of East and of West by the beautiful,
characteristically Christian expression: parrhesia, straightforward
simplicity, filial trust, joyous assurance, humble boldness, the certainty
of being loved.29

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"




II. Abba - "Father!"
2779 Before we make our own this first exclamation of the Lord's
Prayer, we must humbly cleanse our hearts of certain false images
drawn "from this world." Humility makes us recognize that "no one
knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except
the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him," that is,
"to little children."30 The purification of our hearts has to do with
paternal or maternal images, stemming from our personal and cultural
history, and influencing our relationship with God. God our Father
transcends the categories of the created world. To impose our own
ideas in this area "upon him" would be to fabricate idols to adore or
pull down. To pray to the Father is to enter into his mystery as he is
and as the Son has revealed him to us.
The expression God the Father had never been revealed to anyone.
When Moses himself asked God who he was, he heard another name.
the Father's name has been revealed to us in the Son, for the name
"Son" implies the new name "Father."31
2780 We can invoke God as "Father" because he is revealed to us by his
Son become man and because his Spirit makes him known to us. the
personal relation of the Son to the Father is something that man
cannot conceive of nor the angelic powers even dimly see: and yet, the
Spirit of the Son grants a participation in that very relation to us who
believe that Jesus is the Christ and that we are born of God.32
2781 When we pray to the Father, we are in communion with him and
with his Son, Jesus Christ.33 Then we know and recognize him with an
ever new sense of wonder. the first phrase of the Our Father is a
blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of
God that we should recognize him as "Father," the true God. We give
him thanks for having revealed his name to us, for the gift of believing
in it, and for the indwelling of his Presence in us.
2782 We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be reborn
to his life by adopting us as his children in his only Son: by Baptism, he
incorporates us into the Body of his Christ; through the anointing of
his Spirit who flows from the head to the members, he makes us other
"Christs."
God, indeed, who has predestined us to adoption as his sons, has
conformed us to the glorious Body of Christ. So then you who have
become sharers in Christ are appropriately called "Christs."34
The new man, reborn and restored to his God by grace, says first of all,
"Father!" because he has now begun to be a son.35
2783 Thus the Lord's Prayer reveals us to ourselves at the same time
that it reveals the Father to us.36
O man, you did not dare to raise your face to heaven, you lowered your
eyes to the earth, and suddenly you have received the grace of Christ
all your sins have been forgiven. From being a wicked servant you have
become a good son.... Then raise your eyes to the Father who has
begotten you through Baptism, to the Father who has redeemed you
through his Son, and say: "Our Father.... " But do not claim any
privilege. He is the Father in a special way only of Christ, but he is the
common Father of us all, because while he has begotten only Christ,
he has created us. Then also say by his grace, "Our Father," so that you
may merit being his son.37
2784 The free gift of adoption requires on our part continual
conversion and new life. Praying to our Father should develop in us
two fundamental dispositions:
First, the desire to become like him: though created in his image, we
are restored to his likeness by grace; and we must respond to this
grace.
We must remember . . . and know that when we call God "our Father"
we ought to behave as sons of God.38
You cannot call the God of all kindness your Father if you preserve a
cruel and inhuman heart; for in this case you no longer have in you the
marks of the heavenly Father's kindness.39
We must contemplate the beauty of the Father without ceasing and
adorn our own souls accordingly.40
2785 Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us "to turn and
become like children":41 for it is to "little children" that the Father is
revealed.42
[The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God alone, and
by the warmth of love, through which the soul, molded and directed to
love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to its own Father with
special devotion.43
Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us . . . and the confidence
of obtaining what we are about to ask.... What would he not give to his
children who ask, since he has already granted them the gift of being
his children?44

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"




III. "Our" Father
2786 "Our" Father refers to God. the adjective, as used by us, does not
express possession, but an entirely new relationship with God.
2787 When we say "our" Father, we recognize first that all his promises
of love announced by the prophets are fulfilled in the new and eternal
covenant in his Christ: we have become "his" people and he is
henceforth "our" God. This new relationship is the purely gratuitous
gift of belonging to each other: we are to respond to "grace and truth"
given us in Jesus Christ with love and faithfulness.45
2788 Since the Lord's Prayer is that of his people in the "endtime," this
"our" also expresses the certitude of our hope in God's ultimate
promise: in the new Jerusalem he will say to the victor, "I will be his
God and he shall be my son."46
2789 When we pray to "our" Father, we personally address the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ. By doing so we do not divide the Godhead,
since the Father is its "source and origin," but rather confess that the
Son is eternally begotten by him and the Holy Spirit proceeds from
him. We are not confusing the persons, for we confess that our
communion is with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, in their one
Holy Spirit. the Holy Trinity is consubstantial and indivisible. When we
pray to the Father, we adore and glorify him together with the Son and
the Holy Spirit.
2790 Grammatically, "our" qualifies a reality common to more than
one person. There is only one God, and he is recognized as Father by
those who, through faith in his only Son, are reborn of him by water
and the Spirit.47 The Church is this new communion of God and
men. United with the only Son, who has become "the firstborn among
many brethren," she is in communion with one and the same Father in
one and the same Holy Spirit.48 In praying "our" Father, each of the
baptized is praying in this communion: "The company of those who
believed were of one heart and soul."49
2791 For this reason, in spite of the divisions among Christians, this
prayer to "our" Father remains our common patrimony and an urgent
summons for all the baptized. In communion by faith in Christ and by
Baptism, they ought to join in Jesus' prayer for the unity of his
disciples.50
2792 Finally, if we pray the Our Father sincerely, we leave
individualism behind, because the love that we receive frees us from it.
the "our" at the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, like the "us" of the last
four petitions, excludes no one. If we are to say it truthfully, our
divisions and oppositions have to be overcome.51
2793 The baptized cannot pray to "our" Father without bringing
before him all those for whom he gave his beloved Son. God's love has
no bounds, neither should our prayer.52 Praying "our" Father opens to
us the dimensions of his love revealed in Christ: praying with and for
all who do not yet know him, so that Christ may "gather into one the
children of God."53 God's care for all men and for the whole of
creation has inspired all the great practitioners of prayer; it should

Article 2 "OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"




IV. "Who Art in Heaven"
2794 This biblical expression does not mean a place (“space"), but a
way of being; it does not mean that God is distant, but majestic. Our
Father is not "elsewhere": he transcends everything we can conceive of
his holiness. It is precisely because he is thrice holy that he is so close
to the humble and contrite heart.
"Our Father who art in heaven" is rightly understood to mean that
God is in the hearts of the just, as in his holy temple. At the same time,
it means that those who pray should desire the one they invoke to
dwell in them.54
"Heaven" could also be those who bear the image of the heavenly
world, and in whom God dwells and tarries.55
2795 The symbol of the heavens refers us back to the mystery of the
covenant we are living when we pray to our Father. He is in heaven, his
dwelling place; the Father's house is our homeland. Sin has exiled us
from the land of the covenant,56 but conversion of heart enables us to
return to the Father, to heaven.57 Jn Christ, then, heaven and earth
are reconciled,58 for the Son alone "descended from heaven" and
causes us to ascend there with him, by his Cross, Resurrection, and
Ascension.59
2796 When the Church prays "our Father who art in heaven," she is
professing that we are the People of God, already seated "with him in
the heavenly places in Christ Jesus" and "hidden with Christ in
God;"60 yet at the same time, "here indeed we groan, and long to put
on our heavenly dwelling."61
[Christians] are in the flesh, but do not live according to the flesh.
They spend their lives on earth, but are citizens of heaven.62

IN BRIEF
2797 Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assurance are the
proper dispositions for one who prays the Our Father.
2798 We can invoke God as "Father" because the Son of God made
man has revealed him to us. Jn this Son, through Baptism, we are
incorporated and adopted as sons of God.
2799 The Lord's Prayer brings us into communion with the Father and
with his Son, Jesus Christ. At the same time it reveals us to ourselves
(cf GS 22 # 1).
2800 Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to become
like him and foster in us a humble and trusting heart.
2801 When we say "Our" Father, we are invoking the new covenant in
Jesus Christ, communion with the Holy Trinity, and the divine love
which spreads through the Church to encompass the world.
2802 "Who art in heaven" does not refer to a place but to God's
majesty and his presence in the hearts of the just. Heaven, the Father's
house, is the true homeland toward which we are heading and to
which, already, we belong.

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS
2803 After we have placed ourselves in the presence of God our Father
to adore and to love and to bless him, the Spirit of adoption stirs up in
our hearts seven petitions, seven blessings. the first three, more
theological, draw us toward the glory of the Father; the last four, as
ways toward him, commend our wretchedness to his grace. "Deep calls
to deep."63
2804 The first series of petitions carries us toward him, for his own
sake: thy name, thy kingdom, thy will! It is characteristic of love to
think first of the one whom we love. In none of the three petitions do
we mention ourselves; the burning desire, even anguish, of the beloved
Son for his Father's glory seizes us:64 "hallowed be thy name, thy
kingdom come, thy will be done...." These three supplications were
already answered in the saving sacrifice of Christ, but they are
henceforth directed in hope toward their final fulfillment, for God is
not yet all in all.65
2805 The second series of petitions unfolds with the same movement
as certain Eucharistic epicleses: as an offering up of our expectations,
that draws down upon itself the eyes of the Father of mercies. They go
up from us and concern us from this very moment, in our present
world: "give us . . . forgive us . . . lead us not ... deliver us...." the fourth
and fifth petitions concern our life as such - to be fed and to be healed
of sin; the last two concern our battle for the victory of life - that battle
of prayer.
2806 By the three first petitions, we are strengthened in faith, filled
with hope, and set aflame by charity. Being creatures and still sinners,
we have to petition for us, for that "us" bound by the world and history,
which we offer to the boundless love of God. For through the name of
his Christ and the reign of his Holy Spirit, our Father accomplishes his
plan of salvation, for us and for the whole world.

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS




I. "Hallowed be Thy Name"
2807 The term "to hallow" is to be understood here not primarily in its
causative sense (only God hallows, makes holy), but above all in an
evaluative sense: to recognize as holy, to treat in a holy way. and so, in
adoration, this invocation is sometimes understood as praise and
thanksgiving.66 But this petition is here taught to us by Jesus as an
optative: a petition, a desire, and an expectation in which God and
man are involved. Beginning with this first petition to our Father, we
are immersed in the innermost mystery of his Godhead and the drama
of the salvation of our humanity. Asking the Father that his name be
made holy draws us into his plan of loving kindness for the fullness of
time, "according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ," that we
might "be holy and blameless before him in love."67
2808 In the decisive moments of his economy God reveals his name,
but he does so by accomplishing his work. This work, then, is realized
for us and in us only if his name is hallowed by us and in us.
2809 The holiness of God is the inaccessible center of his eternal
mystery. What is revealed of it in creation and history, Scripture calls
"glory," the radiance of his majesty.68 In making man in his image and
likeness, God "crowned him with glory and honor," but by sinning,
man fell "short of the glory of God."69 From that time on, God was to
manifest his holiness by revealing and giving his name, in order to
restore man to the image of his Creator.70
2810 In the promise to Abraham and the oath that accompanied it,71
God commits himself but without disclosing his name. He begins to
reveal it to Moses and makes it known clearly before the eyes of the
whole people when he saves them from the Egyptians: "he has
triumphed gloriously."72 From the covenant of Sinai onwards, this
people is "his own" and it is to be a "holy (or "consecrated": the same
word is used for both in Hebrew) nation,"73 because the name of God
dwells in it.
2811 In spite of the holy Law that again and again their Holy God
gives them - "You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" -
and although the Lord shows patience for the sake of his name, the
people turn away from the Holy One of Israel and profane his name
among the nations.74 For this reason the just ones of the old covenant,
the poor survivors returned from exile, and the prophets burned with
passion for the name.
2812 Finally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given
to us, in the flesh, as Savior, revealed by what he is, by his word, and by
his sacrifice.75 This is the heart of his priestly prayer: "Holy Father . . .
for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in
truth."76 Because he "sanctifies" his own name, Jesus reveals to us the
name of the Father.77 At the end of Christ's Passover, the Father gives
him the name that is above all names: "Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
glory of God the Father."78
2813 In the waters of Baptism, we have been "washed . . . sanctified . . .
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our
God."79 Our Father calls us to holiness in the whole of our life, and
since "he is the source of (our) life in Christ Jesus, who became for us
wisdom from God, and . . .sanctification,"80 both his glory and our life
depend on the hallowing of his name in us and by us. Such is the
urgency of our first petition.
By whom is God hallowed, since he is the one who hallows? But since
he said, "You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD am holy," we seek
and ask that we who were sanctified in Baptism may persevere in what
we have begun to be. and we ask this daily, for we need sanctification
daily, so that we who fail daily may cleanse away our sins by being
sanctified continually.... We pray that this sanctification may remain in
us.81
2814 The sanctification of his name among the nations depends
inseparably on our life and our prayer:
We ask God to hallow his name, which by its own holiness saves and
makes holy all creation .... It is this name that gives salvation to a lost
world. But we ask that this name of God should be hallowed in us
through our actions. For God's name is blessed when we live well, but
is blasphemed when we live wickedly. As the Apostle says: "The name
of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." We ask
then that, just as the name of God is holy, so we may obtain his
holiness in our souls.82
When we say "hallowed be thy name," we ask that it should be
hallowed in us, who are in him; but also in others whom God's grace
still awaits, that we may obey the precept that obliges us to pray for
everyone, even our enemies. That is why we do not say expressly
"hallowed be thy name 'in us,"' for we ask that it be so in all men.83
2815 This petition embodies all the others. Like the six petitions that
follow, it is fulfilled by the prayer of Christ. Prayer to our Father is our
prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus.84 In his priestly prayer,
Jesus asks: "Holy Father, protect in your name those whom you have
given me."85

II. "Thy Kingdom Come"
2816 In the New Testament, the word basileia can be translated by
"kingship" (abstract noun), "kingdom" (concrete noun) or "reign"
(action noun). the Kingdom of God lies ahead of us. It is brought near
in the Word incarnate, it is proclaimed throughout the whole Gospel,
and it has come in Christ's death and Resurrection. the Kingdom of
God has been coming since the Last Supper and, in the Eucharist, it is
in our midst. the kingdom will come in glory when Christ hands it over
to his Father:
It may even be . . . that the Kingdom of God means Christ himself,
whom we daily desire to come, and whose coming we wish to be
manifested quickly to us. For as he is our resurrection, since in him we
rise, so he can also be understood as the Kingdom of God, for in him
we shall reign.86
2817 This petition is "Marana tha," the cry of the Spirit and the Bride:
"Come, Lord Jesus."
Even if it had not been prescribed to pray for the coming of the
kingdom, we would willingly have brought forth this speech, eager to
embrace our hope. In indignation the souls of the martyrs under the
altar cry out to the Lord: "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long
before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the
earth?" For their retribution is ordained for the end of the world.
Indeed as soon as possible, Lord, may your kingdom come!87
2818 In the Lord's Prayer, "thy kingdom come" refers primarily to the
final coming of the reign of God through Christ's return.88 But, far
from distracting the Church from her mission in this present world,
this desire commits her to it all the more strongly. Since Pentecost, the
coming of that Reign is the work of the Spirit of the Lord who
"complete(s) his work on earth and brings us the fullness of grace."89
2819 "The kingdom of God (is) righteousness and peace and joy in the
Holy Spirit."90 The end-time in which we live is the age of the
outpouring of the Spirit. Ever since Pentecost, a decisive battle has
been joined between "the flesh" and the Spirit.91
Only a pure soul can boldly say: "Thy kingdom come." One who has
heard Paul say, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies," and
has purified himself in action, thought and word will say to God: "Thy
kingdom come!"92
2820 By a discernment according to the Spirit, Christians have to
distinguish between the growth of the Reign of God and the progress
of the culture and society in which they are involved. This distinction is
not a separation. Man's vocation to eternal life does not suppress, but
actually reinforces, his duty to put into action in this world the energies
and means received from the Creator to serve justice and peace.93
2821 This petition is taken up and granted in the prayer of Jesus which
is present and effective in the Eucharist; it bears its fruit in new life in
keeping with the Beatitudes.94

III. "Thy Will Be Done on Earth as It is in Heaven"
2822 Our Father "desires all men to be saved and to come to the
knowledge of the truth."95 He "is forbearing toward you, not wishing
that any should perish."96 His commandment is "that you love one
another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another."97
This commandment summarizes all the others and expresses his entire
will.
2823 "He has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to
his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ . . . to gather up all things
in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we have also
obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the
purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel
and will."98 We ask insistently for this loving plan to be fully realized
on earth as it is already in heaven.
2824 In Christ, and through his human will, the will of the Father has
been perfectly fulfilled once for all. Jesus said on entering into this
world: "Lo, I have come to do your will, O God."99 Only Jesus can say:
"I always do what is pleasing to him."100 In the prayer of his agony, he
consents totally to this will: "not my will, but yours be done."101 For
this reason Jesus "gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the
present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."102 "and
by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all."103
2825 "Although he was a Son, [Jesus] learned obedience through what
he suffered."104 How much more reason have we sinful creatures to
learn obedience - we who in him have become children of adoption.
We ask our Father to unite our will to his Son's, in order to fulfill his
will, his plan of salvation for the life of the world. We are radically
incapable of this, but united with Jesus and with the power of his Holy
Spirit, we can surrender our will to him and decide to choose what his
Son has always chosen: to do what is pleasing to the Father.105
In committing ourselves to [Christ], we can become one spirit with
him, and thereby accomplish his will, in such wise that it will be perfect
on earth as it is in heaven.106


Consider how Jesus Christ] teaches us to be humble, by making us see
that our virtue does not depend on our work alone but on grace from
on high. He commands each of the faithful who prays to do so
universally, for the whole world. For he did not say "thy will be done in
me or in us," but "on earth," the whole earth, so that error may be
banished from it, truth take root in it, all vice be destroyed on it, virtue
flourish on it, and earth no longer differ from heaven.107
2826 By prayer we can discern "what is the will of God" and obtain the
endurance to do it.108 Jesus teaches us that one enters the kingdom of
heaven not by speaking words, but by doing "the will of my Father in
heaven."109
2827 "If any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens
to him."110 Such is the power of the Church's prayer in the name of
her Lord, above all in the Eucharist. Her prayer is also a communion of
intercession with the all-holy Mother of God111 and all the saints who
have been pleasing to the Lord because they willed his will alone:
It would not be inconsistent with the truth to understand the words,
"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," to mean: "in the Church
as in our Lord Jesus Christ himself"; or "in the Bride who has been
betrothed, just as in the Bridegroom who has accomplished the will of
the Father."112

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS
IV. "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"
2828 "Give us": the trust of children who look to their Father for
everything is beautiful. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the
good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."113 He gives to all
the living "their food in due season."114 Jesus teaches us this petition,
because it glorifies our Father by acknowledging how good he is,
beyond all goodness.
2829 "Give us" also expresses the covenant. We are his and he is ours,
for our sake. But this "us" also recognizes him as the Father of all men
and we pray to him for them all, in solidarity with their needs and
sufferings.
2830 "Our bread": the Father who gives us life cannot not but give us
the nourishment life requires - all appropriate goods and blessings,
both material and spiritual. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus insists
on the filial trust that cooperates with our Father's providence.115 He
is not inviting us to idleness,116 but wants to relieve us from nagging
worry and preoccupation. Such is the filial surrender of the children of
God:
To those who seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, he has
promised to give all else besides. Since everything indeed belongs to
God, he who possesses God wants for nothing, if he himself is not
found wanting before God.117
2831 But the presence of those who hunger because they lack bread
opens up another profound meaning of this petition. the drama of
hunger in the world calls Christians who pray sincerely to exercise
responsibility toward their brethren, both in their personal behavior
and in their solidarity with the human family. This petition of the
Lord's Prayer cannot be isolated from the parables of the poor man
Lazarus and of the Last Judgment.118
2832 As leaven in the dough, the newness of the kingdom should make
the earth "rise" by the Spirit of Christ.119 This must be shown by the
establishment of justice in personal and social, economic and
international relations, without ever forgetting that there are no just
structures without people who want to be just.
2833 "Our" bread is the "one" loaf for the "many." In the Beatitudes
"poverty" is the virtue of sharing: it calls us to communicate and share
both material and spiritual goods, not by coercion but out of love, so
that the abundance of some may remedy the needs of others.120
2834 "Pray and work."121 "Pray as if everything depended on God
and work as if everything depended on you."122 Even when we have
done our work, the food we receive is still a gift from our Father; it is
good to ask him for it, as Christian families do when saying grace at
meals.
2835 This petition, with the responsibility it involves, also applies to
another hunger from which men are perishing: "Man does not live by
bread alone, but . . . by every word that proceeds from the mouth of
God,"123 that is, by the Word he speaks and the Spirit he breathes
forth. Christians must make every effort "to proclaim the good news to
the poor." There is a famine on earth, "not a famine of bread, nor a
thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD."124 For this
reason the specifically Christian sense of this fourth petition concerns
the Bread of Life: the Word of God accepted in faith, the Body of
Christ received in the Eucharist.125
2836 "This day" is also an expression of trust taught us by the
Lord,126 which we would never have presumed to invent. Since it
refers above all to his Word and to the Body of his Son, this "today" is
not only that of our mortal time, but also the "today" of God.
If you receive the bread each day, each day is today for you. If Christ is
yours today, he rises for you every day. How can this be? "You are my
Son, today I have begotten you." Therefore, "today" is when Christ
rises.127
2837 "Daily" (epiousios) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.
Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of "this
day,"128 to confirm us in trust "without reservation." Taken in the
qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more
broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence.129 Taken literally
(epi-ousios: "super-essential"), it refers directly to the Bread of Life, the
Body of Christ, the "medicine of immortality," without which we have
no life within us.130 Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is
evident: "this day" is the Day of the Lord, the day of the feast of the
kingdom, anticipated in the Eucharist that is already the foretaste of
the kingdom to come. For this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic
liturgy to be celebrated each day.
The Eucharist is our daily bread. the power belonging to this divine
food makes it a bond of union. Its effect is then understood as unity, so
that, gathered into his Body and made members of him, we may
become what we receive.... This also is our daily bread: the readings
you hear each day in church and the hymns you hear and sing. All
these are necessities for our pilgrimage.131


The Father in heaven urges us, as children of heaven, to ask for the
bread of heaven. [Christ] himself is the bread who, sown in the Virgin,
raised up in the flesh, kneaded in the Passion, baked in the oven of the
tomb, reserved in churches, brought to altars, furnishes the faithful
each day with food from heaven.132

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS




V. "And Forgive Us Our Trespasses, as We Forgive Those Who Trespass
AGAINST US"
2838 This petition is astonishing. If it consisted only of the first phrase,
"and forgive us our trespasses," it might have been included, implicitly,
in the first three petitions of the Lord's Prayer, since Christ's sacrifice is
"that sins may be forgiven." But, according to the second phrase, our
petition will not be heard unless we have first met a strict requirement.
Our petition looks to the future, but our response must come first, for
the two parts are joined by the single word "as."
and forgive us our trespasses . . .
2839 With bold confidence, we began praying to our Father. In
begging him that his name be hallowed, we were in fact asking him
that we ourselves might be always made more holy. But though we are
clothed with the baptismal garment, we do not cease to sin, to turn
away from God. Now, in this new petition, we return to him like the
prodigal son and, like the tax collector, recognize that we are sinners
before him.133 Our petition begins with a "confession" of our
wretchedness and his mercy. Our hope is firm because, in his Son, "we
have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."134 We find the efficacious
and undoubted sign of his forgiveness in the sacraments of his
Church.135
2840 Now - and this is daunting - this outpouring of mercy cannot
penetrate our hearts as long as we have not forgiven those who have
trespassed against us. Love, like the Body of Christ, is indivisible; we
cannot love the God we cannot see if we do not love the brother or
sister we do see.136 In refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our
hearts are closed and their hardness makes them impervious to the
Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are opened
to his grace.
2841 This petition is so important that it is the only one to which the
Lord returns and which he develops explicitly in the Sermon on the
Mount.137 This crucial requirement of the covenant mystery is
impossible for man. But "with God all things are possible."138
. . . as we forgive those who trespass against us
2842 This "as" is not unique in Jesus' teaching: "You, therefore, must
be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect"; "Be merciful, even as
your Father is merciful"; "A new commandment I give to you, that you
love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one
another."139 It is impossible to keep the Lord's commandment by
imitating the divine model from outside; there has to be a vital
participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and
the mercy and the love of our God. Only the Spirit by whom we live
can make "ours" the same mind that was in Christ Jesus.140 Then the
unity of forgiveness becomes possible and we find ourselves "forgiving
one another, as God in Christ forgave" us.141
2843 Thus the Lord's words on forgiveness, the love that loves to the
end,142 become a living reality. the parable of the merciless servant,
which crowns the Lord's teaching on ecclesial communion, ends with
these words: "So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if
you do not forgive your brother from your heart."143 It is there, in
fact, "in the depths of the heart," that everything is bound and loosed.
It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the heart
that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and
purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession.
2844 Christian prayer extends to the forgiveness of enemies,144
transfiguring the disciple by configuring him to his Master. Forgiveness
is a high-point of Christian prayer; only hearts attuned to God's
compassion can receive the gift of prayer. Forgiveness also bears
witness that, in our world, love is stronger than sin. the martyrs of
yesterday and today bear this witness to Jesus. Forgiveness is the
fundamental condition of the reconciliation of the children of God
with their Father and of men with one another.145
2845 There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine
forgiveness,146 whether one speaks of "sins" as in Luke (? 11:4),
"debts" as in Matthew (? 6:12). We are always debtors: "Owe no one
anything, except to love one another."147 The communion of the Holy
Trinity is the source and criterion of truth in every relation ship. It is
lived out in prayer, above all in the Eucharist.148
God does not accept the sacrifice of a sower of disunion, but
commands that he depart from the altar so that he may first be
reconciled with his brother. For God can be appeased only by prayers
that make peace. To God, the better offering is peace, brotherly
concord, and a people made one in the unity of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.149

Article 3 THE SEVEN PETITIONS




VI. "And Lead Us not into Temptation"
2846 This petition goes to the root of the preceding one, for our sins
result from our consenting to temptation; we therefore ask our Father
not to "lead" us into temptation. It is difficult to translate the Greek
verb used by a single English word: the Greek means both "do not
allow us to enter into temptation" and "do not let us yield to
temptation."150 "God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself
tempts no one";151 on the contrary, he wants to set us free from evil.
We ask him not to allow us to take the way that leads to sin. We are
engaged in the battle "between flesh and spirit"; this petition implores
the Spirit of discernment and strength.
2847 The Holy Spirit makes us discern between trials, which are
necessary for the growth of the inner man,152 and temptation, which
leads to sin and death.153 We must also discern between being
tempted and consenting to temptation. Finally, discernment unmasks
the lie of temptation, whose object appears to be good, a "delight to the
eyes" and desirable,154 when in reality its fruit is death.
God does not want to impose the good, but wants free beings.... There
is a certain usefulness to temptation. No one but God knows what our
soul has received from him, not even we ourselves. But temptation
reveals it in order to teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we
discover our evil inclinations and are obliged to give thanks for the
goods that temptation has revealed to us.155
2848 "Lead us not into temptation" implies a decision of the heart:
"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.... No one can
serve two masters."156 "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the
Spirit."157 In this assent to the Holy Spirit the Father gives us
strength. "No testing has overtaken you that is not common to man.
God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your
strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape,
so that you may be able to endure it."158
2849 Such a battle and such a victory become possible only through
prayer. It is by his prayer that Jesus vanquishes the tempter, both at the
outset of his public mission and in the ultimate struggle of his
agony.159 In this petition to our heavenly Father, Christ unites us to
his battle and his agony. He urges us to vigilance of the heart in
communion with his own. Vigilance is "custody of the heart," and Jesus
prayed for us to the Father: "Keep them in your name."160 The Holy
Spirit constantly seeks to awaken us to keep watch.161 Finally, this
petition takes on all its dramatic meaning in relation to the last
temptation of our earthly battle; it asks for final perseverance. "Lo, I
am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake."162
VII "BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL"
2850 The last petition to our Father is also included in Jesus' prayer: "I
am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to
protect them from the evil one."163 It touches each of us personally,
but it is always "we" who pray, in communion with the whole Church,
for the deliverance of the whole human family. the Lord's Prayer
continually opens us to the range of God's economy of salvation. Our
interdependence in the drama of sin and death is turned into solidarity
in the Body of Christ, the "communion of saints."164
2851 In this petition, evil is not an abstraction, but refers to a person,
Satan, the Evil One, the angel who opposes God. the devil (dia-bolos)
is the one who "throws himself across" God's plan and his work of
salvation accomplished in Christ.
2852 "A murderer from the beginning, . . . a liar and the father of lies,"
Satan is "the deceiver of the whole world."165 Through him sin and
death entered the world and by his definitive defeat all creation will be
"freed from the corruption of sin and death."166 Now "we know that
anyone born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps
him, and the evil one does not touch him.
We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of
the evil one."167
The Lord who has taken away your sin and pardoned your faults also
protects you and keeps you from the wiles of your adversary the devil,
so that the enemy, who is accustomed to leading into sin, may not
surprise you. One who entrusts himself to God does not dread the
devil. "If God is for us, who is against us?"168
2853 Victory over the "prince of this world"169 was won once for all at
the Hour when Jesus freely gave himself up to death to give us his life.
This is the judgment of this world, and the prince of this world is "cast
out."170 "He pursued the woman"171 but had no hold on her: the
new Eve, "full of grace" of the Holy Spirit, is preserved from sin and
the corruption of death (the Immaculate Conception and the
Assumption of the Most Holy Mother of God, Mary, ever virgin).
"Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make
war on the rest of her offspring."172 Therefore the Spirit and the
Church pray: "Come, Lord Jesus,"173 since his coming will deliver us
from the Evil One.
2854 When we ask to be delivered from the Evil One, we pray as well
to be freed from all evils, present, past, and future, of which he is the
author or instigator. In this final petition, the Church brings before the
Father all the distress of the world. Along with deliverance from the
evils that overwhelm humanity, she implores the precious gift of peace
and the grace of perseverance in expectation of Christ's return By
praying in this way, she anticipates in humility of faith the gathering
together of everyone and everything in him who has "the keys of Death
and Hades," who "is and who was and who is to come, the
Almighty."174
Deliver us, Lord, we beseech you, from every evil and grant us peace in
our day, so that aided by your mercy we might be ever free from sin
and protected from all anxiety, as we await the blessed hope and the
coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.175

Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY
2855 The final doxology, "For the kingdom, the power and the glory
are yours, now and forever," takes up again, by inclusion, the first three
petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the coming of his
reign, and the power of his saving will. But these prayers are now
proclaimed as adoration and thanksgiving, as in the liturgy of
heaven.176 The ruler of this world has mendaciously attributed to
himself the three titles of kingship, power, and glory.177 Christ, the
Lord, restores them to his Father and our Father, until he hands over
the kingdom to him when the mystery of salvation will be brought to
its completion and God will be all in all.178
2856 "Then, after the prayer is over you say 'Amen,' which means 'So
be it,' thus ratifying with our 'Amen' what is contained in the prayer

Article 4 THE FINAL DOXOLOGY


IN BRIEF
2857 In the Our Father, the object of the first three petitions is the
glory of the Father: the sanctification of his name, the coming of the
kingdom, and the fulfillment of his will. the four others present our
wants to him: they ask that our lives be nourished, healed of sin, and
made victorious in the struggle of good over evil.
2858 By asking "hallowed be thy name" we enter into God's plan, the
sanctification of his name - revealed first to Moses and then in Jesus -
by us and in us, in every nation and in each man.
2859 By the second petition, the Church looks first to Christ's return
and the final coming of the Reign of God. It also prays for the growth
of the Kingdom of God in the "today" of our own lives.
2860 In the third petition, we ask our Father to unite our will to that of
his Son, so as to fulfill his plan of salvation in the life of the world.
2861 In the fourth petition, by saying "give us," we express in
communion with our brethren our filial trust in our heavenly Father.
"Our daily bread" refers to the earthly nourishment necessary to
everyone for subsistence, and also to the Bread of Life: the Word of
God and the Body of Christ. It is received in God's "today," as the
indispensable, (super - ) essential nourishment of the feast of the
coming Kingdom anticipated in the Eucharist.
2862 The fifth petition begs God's mercy for our offences, mercy
which can penetrate our hearts only if we have learned to forgive our
enemies, with the example and help of Christ.
2863 When we say "lead us not into temptation" we are asking God
not to allow us to take the path that leads to sin. This petition implores
the Spirit of discernment and strength; it requests the grace of
vigilance and final perseverance.
2864 In the last petition, "but deliver us from evil," Christians pray to
God with the Church to show forth the victory, already won by Christ,
over the "ruler of this world," Satan, the angel personally opposed to
God and to his plan of salvation.
2865 By the final "Amen," we express our "fiat" concerning the seven
petitions: "So be it".

                             ORIGIN OF THE ROMAN CATECHISM

The Church at the Council of Trent, assembled December 13, 1545, seeing the need of a uniform and
comprehensive manual which would supply parish priests with an official book of instruction for the faithful,
ordered the preparation of the work which has ever since been variously known as the Catechism of the Council
of Trent, the Catechism for Parish Priests, the Roman Catechism, or the Catechism of Pius V. It was some
months, however, after the opening of the Council before mention was made of any kind of catechism. This was
during the fourth session, on April 5, 1546. Eight days later the draft of a decree was read proposing that there
be published in Latin and in the vernacular a catechism to be compiled by capable persons for children and
uninstructed adults, "who are in need of milk rather than solid food." The purpose of such a manual was to
afford instruction for beginners in the primary duties of a Christian life and to prepare them for further and
higher religious education. The idea met with general approval, but as the Council was occupied with matters
more pressing, we hear nothing further about it until sixteen years later, in 1562. According to some the
question of the Catechism was brought up by St. Charles Borromeo during the eighteenth session and a
commission actually appointed on February 26, 1562. What is certain is that the Papal Legates, after a
protracted discussion, had named a committee before the end of that year; for on January 3, 1563, they informed
the procurators of Charles IX and of Ferdinand I of the existence of such a committee and assured them that
work on the Catechism was already under way. The principal members of this committee, besides its president,
Cardinal Seripandi, O. S. A., were Leonardo Marini, O. P., Archbishop of Lanciano, Egidio Foscarari, O. P.,
Bishop of Modena, Muzio Calini, Bishop of Zara, and Francesco Foreiro, O.P. There were many other
collaborators, chief among whom were Michael Medina, a Franciscan, and Christopher Sanctotisio, O. S. A.,
who assisted with the fourth and ninth Articles of the Creed respectively; four French theologians to whom
were assigned the first four Commandments; the Dominicans, John de Luderna, Benedict Herba, Eliseus Capys,
and the Franciscan, Alphonsus Contreras, to whom were given respectively the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
Commandments; a theologian of Granada was entrusted with the last two Commandments of the Decalogue.
The following appear to have collaborated on the Sacraments: three Flemish theologians, on Baptism,
Confirmation, and the Eucharist; Nicholas Ormanetus, on the Sacrament of Penance; Peter Fernandez, O. P., on
Matrimony; Cosmas Damiani, Abbot of the Augustinian Canons Regular, on Orders; Arias Montanus, on
Extreme Unction. All those who had part in the work of the Catechism were instructed to avoid in its
composition the particular opinions of individuals and schools, and to express the doctrine of the universal
Church, keeping especially in mind the decrees of the Council of Trent.

During the twenty-fourth session, the work on the Catechism was brought to the attention of the Council itself,
at a meeting on September II, 1563. After various discussions a new plan was adopted. Instead of a manual for
children and uninstructed adults, it was decided to prepare a much more extensive and more thorough work to
be used by parish priests in their instruction of the faithful. A final decree regarding such a catechism was
passed in a general meeting of November 2nd, of the same year, wherein it was enjoined on all Bishops to see
that the Catechism should be faithfully translated into the vulgar tongue and expounded to the people by all
parish priests.

As the Council was about to close, the Catechism committee, as it appears, were ordered to submit to the
assembled Fathers the work they had so far accomplished. This was done at the general meetings between the
22nd and the 25th of November, and as the work was not finished the Holy Father was requested to take charge
of it and to see that the Catechism was brought to completion and published. The manuscript was, therefore,
carried to Rome, and the work was continued with little delay. Meanwhile Cardinal Seripandi died, and St.
Charles Borromeo was appointed to succeed him as president of the Catechism committee. On December 21,
1564, Bishop Foscarari also died. To complete the work the new president enlisted the services of several more
theologians, such as Gabriel Paleotti and the Portugese Statius.

In order that the literary style of the Catechism might be in keeping with the sublimity of its doctrine, St.
Charles called to its service the greatest masters of the Latin tongue of that age. These were Paulus Manutius,
Giulio Pogiani, Cornelius Amaltheus, Silvius Antonianus, and Pietro Galesini. When the work was finished a



                                                       25
first revision of the style was undertaken. The polishing of the first two parts was done by Calini, who had
already been engaged in the composition of the Catechism. The third part was attended to by Galesini, and the
fourth by Pogiani. This revision seems to have been completed by the end of the year 1564. Early in the
following year, by order of St. Charles, who desired to secure absolute uniformity in the style, a second literary
revision of the entire work was made by Pogiani.

Meanwhile Pius IV died and was succeeded on January 17, 1566, by Pius V. One of the first acts of the new
Pontiff was to appoint a number of expert theological revisers to examine every statement in the Catechism
from the viewpoint of doctrine. Chief among these revisers were Cardinal Sirlet and the two Dominicans,
Thomas Manriquez and Eustachius Locatelli. By July of that year the work on the Catechism was finished. But
it was not until the close of the year that it appeared under the title, Catechismus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini
ad Parochos Pii V Pont. Max. jussu editus.




           AUTHORITY AND EXCELLENCE OF THE ROMAN CATECHISM

The Roman Catechism is unlike any other summary of Christian doctrine, not only because it is intended for the
use of priests in their preaching, but also because it enjoys a unique authority among manuals. In the first place,
as already explained, it was issued by the express command of the Ecumenical Council of Trent, which also
ordered that it be translated into the vernacular of different nations to be used as a standard source for
preaching. Moreover it subsequently received the unqualified approval of many Sovereign Pontiffs. Not to
speak of Pius IV who did so much to bring the work to completion, and of St. Pius V under whom it was
finished, published and repeatedly commended, Gregory XIII, as Possevino testifies, so highly esteemed it that
he desired even books of Canon Law to be written in accordance with its contents. In his Bull of June 14, 1761,
Clement XIII said that the Catechism contains a clear explanation of all that is necessary for salvation and
useful for the faithful, that it was composed with great care and industry and has been highly praised by all, that
by it in former times the faith was strengthened, and that no other catechism can be compared with it. He
concluded then, that the Roman Pontiffs offered this work to pastors as a norm of Catholic teaching and
discipline so that there might be uniformity and harmony in the instructions of all. Nor have the Sovereign
Pontiffs in our own days been less laudatory of the Catechism. Pope Leo XIII, in an Encyclical Letter of
September 8, 1899, to the Bishops and clergy of France, recommended two books which all seminarians should
possess and constantly read and study, namely, the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas and "that golden book,"
the Catechismus ad Parochos. Regarding the latter work he wrote: "This work is remarkable at once for the
richness and exactness of its doctrine, and for the elegance of its style; it is a precious summary of all theology,
both dogmatic and moral. He who understands it well, will have always at his service those aids by which a
priest is enabled to preach with fruit, to acquit himself worthily of the important ministry of the confessional
and of the direction of souls, and will be in a position to refute the objections of unbelievers."

Likewise Pius X in his Encyclical Acerbo nimis of April 15, 1905, declared that adults, no less than children,
need religious instruction, especially in these days. And hence he prescribed that pastors and all who have care
of souls should give catechetical instruction to the faithful in simple language, and in a way suited to the
capacity of their hearers, and that for this purpose they should use the Catechism of the Council of Trent Still
more recently, on February 14, 1921, speaking in the name of Benedict XV, Cardinal Gasparri, Papal Secretary
of State, thus wrote to the Archbishop of New York relative to the latter's Program for A Parochial Course of
Doctrinal Instructions, based on the Catechism: "It is superfluous to add that the value of the work is enhanced
by the fact that it has been planned and executed in perfect harmony with the admirable Catechism of the
Council of Trent."

Besides the Supreme Pontiffs who have extolled and recommended the Catechism, so many Councils have
enjoined its use that it would be impossible here to enumerate them all. Within a few years after its first
appearance great numbers of provincial and diocesan synods had already made its use obligatory. Of these the
Preface to the Paris edition of 1893 mentions eighteen held before the year 1595. In five different Councils
convened at Milan St. Charles Borromeo ordered that the Catechism should be studied in seminaries, discussed



                                                        26
in the conferences of the clergy, and explained by pastors to their people on occasion of the administration of
the Sacraments. In short, synods repeatedly prescribed that the clergy should make such frequent use of the
Catechism as not only to be thoroughly familiar with its contents, but almost have it by heart.

In addition to Popes, and Councils, many Cardinals, Bishops and other ecclesiastics, distinguished for their
learning and sanctity, vied with one another in eulogizing the Catechism of Trent. Among other things they
have said that not since the days of the Apostles has there been produced in a single volume so complete and
practical a summary of Christian doctrine as this Catechism, and that, after the Sacred Scriptures, there is no
work that can be read with greater safety and profit.

In particular, Cardinal Valerius, the friend of St. Charles Borromeo, wrote of the Catechism: "This work
contains all that is needful for the instruction of the faithful; and it is written with such order, clearness and
majesty that through it we seem to hear holy Mother the Church herself, taught by the Holy Ghost, speaking to
us.... It was composed by order of the Fathers of Trent under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and was
published by the authority of the Vicar of Christ."

Salmanticenses, the great Carmelite commentators on St. Thomas, paid the following high tribute to the
Catechism: "The authority of this Catechism has always been of the greatest in the Church, because it was
composed by the command of the Council of Trent, because its authors were men of highest learning, and
because it was approved only after the severest scrutiny by Popes Pius V and Gregory XIII, and has been
recommended in nearly all the Councils that have been held since the Council of Trent."

Antonio Possevino, an illustrious Jesuit, and the preceptor of St. Francis de Sales, said: "The Catechism of the
Council of Trent was inspired by the Holy Ghost."

In his immortal Apologia Cardinal Newman writes: "The Catechism of the Council of Trent was drawn up for
the express purpose of providing preachers with subjects for their sermons; and, as my whole work has been a
defense of myself, I may here say that I rarely preach a sermon but I go to this beautiful and complete
Catechism to get both my matter and my doctrine."

"Its merits," says Dr. Donovan, "have been recognized by the universal Church. The first rank which has been
awarded the Imitation among spiritual books, has been unanimously given to the Roman Catechism as a
compendium of Catholic theology. It was the result of the aggregate labors of the most distinguished of the
Fathers of Trent, . . . and is therefore stamped with the impress of superior worth."

Doctor John Hogan, the present Rector of the Irish College in Rome, writes thus: "The Roman Catechism is a
work of exceptional authority. At the very least it has the same authority as a dogmatic Encyclical, -- it is an
authoritative exposition of Catholic doctrine given forth, and guaranteed to be orthodox by the Catholic Church
and her supreme head on earth. The compilation of it was the work of various individuals; but the result of their
combined labors was accepted by the Church as a precious abridgment of dogmatic and moral theology.
Official documents have occasionally been issued by Popes to explain certain points of Catholic teaching to
individuals, or to local Christian communities; whereas the Roman Catechism comprises practically the whole
body of Christian doctrine, and is addressed to the whole Church. Its teaching is not infallible; but it holds a
place between approved catechisms and what is de tide."

We are enabled to realize from the foregoing testimonies how invaluable is the treasure we possess in the
Tridentine Catechism. It is a Vade Mecum for every priest and ecclesiastical student. In it the latter will find a
recapitulation of all the more important and necessary doctrines he has learned throughout his theological
course; while to the priest it is not only a review of his former studies, but an ever-present and reliable guide in
his work as pastor, preacher, counselor, and spiritual director of souls. Moreover, to the educated layman,
whether Catholic or non-Catholic, who desires to study an authoritative statement of Catholic doctrine, no better
book could be recommended than this official manual; for in its pages will be found the whole substance of
Catholic doctrine and practice, arranged in order, expounded with perspicuity, and sustained by argument at
once convincing and persuasive.



                                                        27
Finally, it can be said without fear of exaggeration that there is no single-volume work which so combines
solidity of doctrine and practical usefulness with unction of treatment as does this truly marvelous Catechism.
From beginning to end it not only reflects the light of faith, but it also radiates, to an unwonted degree, the
warmth of devotion and piety. In its exposition of the Creed and the Sacraments, while dealing with the
profoundest mysteries, it is full of thoughts and reflections the most fervent and inspiring. The part on the
Decalogue, which might well be called a treatise on ascetical theology, teaches us in words burning with zeal
both what we are to avoid and what we are to do to keep the Commandments of God. In the fourth, and last part
o this beautiful work we have what is doubtless the most sublime and heavenly exposition of the doctrine of
prayer ever written.

The Roman Catechism is, therefore, a handbook of dogmatic and moral theology, a confessor's guide, a book of
exposition for the preacher, and a choice directory of the spiritual life for pastor and flock alike. With a view,
consequently, to make it more readily available for these high purposes among English-speaking peoples this
new translation has been prepared and is herewith respectfully submitted to its readers.

 CATECHISM OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT FOR PARISH PRIESTS

                                       Issued by order of Pope Pius V



                                             INTRODUCTORY



The Necessity Of Religious Instruction

Such is the nature of the human mind and intellect that, although by means of diligent and laborious inquiry it
has of itself investigated and discovered many other things pertaining to a knowledge of divine truths; yet
guided by its natural lights it never could have known or perceived most of those things by which is attained
eternal salvation, the principal end of man's creation and formation to the image and likeness of God.

It is true that the invisible things of God from the creation of the world are, as the Apostle teaches, clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made: his eternal power also, and divinity. But the mystery which hath
been hidden from ages and generations so far transcends the reach of man's understanding, that were it not made
manifest by God to His Saints, to whom He willed to make known by the gift of faith, the riches of the glory of
this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, man could by no effort attain to such wisdom.

But, as faith comes by hearing, it is clear how necessary at all times for the attainment of eternal salvation has
been the labour and faithful ministry of an authorised teacher; for it is written, how shall they hear, without a
preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be sent?

And, indeed, never, from the very creation of the world, has God, most merciful and benignant, been wanting to
His own; but at sundry times and in divers manners spoke to the fathers by the prophets, and pointed out to
them in a manner suited to the times and circumstances, a sure and direct path to the happiness of heaven. But,
as He had foretold that He would give a teacher of justice to be the light of the Gentiles, that His salvation
might reach even to the ends of the earth, in these last days he hath spoken to us by his Son, whom also by a
voice from heaven, from the excellent glory, He has commanded all to hear and to obey. Furthermore, the Son
gave some to be apostles, and some prophets, and others pastors and teachers, to announce the word of life; that
we might not be carried about like children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, but holding fast to the
firm foundation of the faith, we might be built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.

Lest any should receive the Word of God from the ministers of the Church, not as the word of Christ, which it
really is, but as the word of man, the same Saviour has ordained that their ministry should be invested with so
great authority that He says to them: He that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you despises me. These
words He spoke not only of those to whom His words were addressed, but likewise of all who, by legitimate
succession, should discharge the ministry of the word, promising to be with them all days even to the
consummation of the world.




Need of an Authoritative Catholic Catechism

But while the preaching of the divine Word should never be interrupted in the Church, surely in these, our days,
it becomes necessary to labour with more than ordinary zeal and piety to nourish and strengthen the faithful


                                                         29
with sound and wholesome doctrine, as with the food of life. For false prophets have gone forth into the world,
to corrupt the minds of the faithful with various and strange doctrines, of whom the Lord has said: I did not send
prophets, yet they ran; I spoke not to them, yet they prophesied.

In this work, to such extremes has their impiety, practiced in all the arts of Satan, been carried, that it would
seem almost impossible to confine it within any bounds; and did we not rely on the splendid promises of the
Saviour, who declared that He had built His Church on so solid a foundation that the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it, we should have good reason to fear lest, beset on every side by such a host of enemies and
assailed and attacked by so many machinations, it would, in these days, fall to the ground.

For - to say nothing of those illustrious States which heretofore professed, in piety and holiness, the true
Catholic faith transmitted to them by their ancestors, but are now gone astray wandering from the paths of truth
and openly declaring that their best claims to piety are founded on a total abandonment of the faith of their
fathers - there is no region, however remote, no place, however securely guarded, no corner of Christendom,
into which this pestilence has not sought secretly to insinuate itself.

For those who intended to corrupt the minds of the faithful, knowing that they could not hold immediate
personal intercourse with all, and thus pour into their ears their poisoned doctrines, adopted another plan which
enabled them to disseminate error and impiety more easily and extensively. Besides those voluminous works by
which they sought the subversion of the Catholic faith - to guard against which (volumes) required perhaps little
labour or circumspection, since their contents were clearly heretical - they also composed innumerable smaller
books, which, veiling their errors under the semblance of piety, deceived with incredible facility the
unsuspecting minds of simple folk.




The Nature of this Work

The Fathers, therefore, of the General Council of Trent, anxious to apply some healing remedy to so great and
pernicious an evil, were not satisfied with having decided the more important points of Catholic doctrine against
the heresies of our times, but deemed it further necessary to issue, for the instruction of the faithful in the very
rudiments of faith, a form and method to be followed in all churches by those to whom are lawfully entrusted
the duties of pastor and teacher.

To works of this kind many, it is true, had already given their attention, and earned the reputation of great piety
and learning. But the Fathers deemed it of the first importance that a work should appear, sanctioned by the
authority of the Council, from which pastors and all others on whom the duty of imparting instruction devolves,
may be able to seek and find reliable matter for the edification of the faithful; that, as there is one Lord, one
faith, there may also be one standard and prescribed form of propounding the dogmas of faith, and instructing
Christians in all the duties of piety.

As, therefore, the design of the work embraces a variety of matters, it cannot be supposed that the Council
intended that in one volume all the dogmas of Christianity should be explained with that minuteness of detail to
be found in the works of those who profess to treat the teaching and doctrines of religion in their entirety. Such
a task would be one of almost endless labour, and manifestly ill suited to attain the proposed end. But, having
undertaken to instruct pastors and such as have care of souls in those things that belong peculiarly to the
pastoral office and are accommodated to the capacity of the faithful, the Council intended that such things only
should be treated of as might assist the pious zeal of pastors in discharging the duty of instruction, should they
not be very familiar with the more abstruse questions of theology.




The Ends of Religious Instruction



                                                         30
Hence, before we proceed to develop in detail the various parts of this summary of doctrine, our purpose
requires that we premise a few observations which the pastor should consider and bear in mind in order to know
to what end, as it were, all his plans and labours and efforts are to be directed, and how this desired end may be
more easily attained.




Knowledge Of Christ

The first thing is ever to recollect that all Christian knowledge is reduced to one single head, or rather, to use the
words of the Apostle, this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
thou hast sent. A teacher in the Church should, therefore, use his best endeavours that the faithful earnestly
desire to know Jesus Christ, and him crucified, that they be firmly convinced, and with the most heartfelt piety
and devotion believe, that there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved, for he
is the propitiation for our sins.




Observance Of The Commandments

But since by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments, the next consideration, and
one intimately connected with the preceding, is to press also upon the attention of the faithful that their lives are
not to be wasted in ease and indolence, but that we are to walk even as he walked, and pursue with all
earnestness, justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness; for He gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. These
things the Apostle commands pastors to speak and exhort.




Love Of God

But as our Lord and Saviour has not only declared, but has also proved by His own example, that the Law and
the Prophets depend on love, and as, according to the Apostle, charity is the end of the commandment, and the
fulfilment of the law, it is unquestionably a chief duty of the pastor to use the utmost diligence to excite the
faithful to a love of the infinite goodness of God towards us, that, burning with a sort of divine ardour, they may
be powerfully attracted to the supreme and all-perfect good, to adhere to which is true and solid happiness, as is
fully experienced by him who can say with the Prophet: What have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I
desire upon earth?

This, assuredly, is that more excellent way pointed out by the Apostle when he sums up all his doctrines and
instructions in charity, which never falleth away. For whatever is proposed by the pastor, whether it be the
exercise of faith, of hope, or of some moral virtue, the love of our Lord should at the same time be so strongly
insisted upon as to show clearly that all the works of perfect Christian virtue can have no other origin, no other
end than divine love.




The Means Required for Religious Instruction

But as in imparting instruction of any sort the manner of communicating it is of highest importance, so in
conveying religious instruction to the people, the method should be deemed of the greatest moment.




                                                         31
Instruction Should Be Accommodated To The Capacity Of The Hearer

Age, capacity, manners and condition must be borne in mind, so that he who instructs may become all things to
all men, in order that he may be able to gain all to Christ, prove himself a dutiful minister and steward, and, like
a good and faithful servant, be found worthy to be placed by his Lord over many things The priest must not
imagine that those committed to his care are all on the same level, so that he can follow one fixed and unvarying
method of instruction to lead all in the same way to knowledge and true piety; for some are as new-born infants,
others are growing up in Christ, while a few are, so to say, of full maturity. Hence the necessity of considering
who they are that have occasion for milk, who for more solid food, and of affording to each such nourishment
of doctrine as may give spiritual increase, until we all meet in the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the
Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ. This the Apostle
inculcates for all by his own example when he says that he is a debtor to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the
wise and to the unwise, thus giving all who are called to this ministry to understand that in announcing the
mysteries of faith and the precepts of life, the instruction is to be so accommodated to the capacity and
intelligence of the hearers, that, while the minds of the strong are filled with spiritual food, the little ones be not
suffered to perish with hunger, asking for bread, while there is none to break it unto them.




Zeal

Nor should our zeal in communicating Christian knowledge be relaxed because it has sometimes to be exercised
in expounding matters apparently humble and unimportant, and whose exposition is usually irksome, especially
to minds accustomed to the contemplation of the more sublime truths of religion. If the Wisdom of the eternal
Father descended upon the earth in the meanness of our flesh to teach us the maxims of a heavenly life, who is
there whom the love of Christ does not constrain to become little in the midst of his brethren, and, as a nurse
fostering her children, so anxiously to wish for the salvation of his neighbours as to be ready, as the Apostle
says of himself, to give them not only the gospel of God, but even his own life.




Study Of The Word Of God

Now all the doctrines in which the faithful are to be instructed are contained in the Word of God, which is found
in Scripture and tradition. To the study of these, therefore, the pastor should devote his days and his nights,
keeping in mind the admonition of St. Paul to Timothy, which all who have the care of souls should consider as
addressed to themselves: Attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine, for all Scripture divinely inspired is
profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct injustice, that the man of God may be perfect, furnished to
every good work.




Division of this Catechism

The truths revealed by Almighty God are so many and so various that it is no easy task to acquire a knowledge
of them, or, having done so, to remember them so well as to be able to explain them with ease and readiness
when occasion requires. Hence our predecessors in the faith have very wisely reduced all the doctrines of
salvation to these four heads: The Apostles' Creed, the Sacraments, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's
Prayer.

The part on the Creed contains all that is to be held according to Christian faith, whether it regard the
knowledge of God, the creation and government of the world, or the redemption of man, the rewards of the
good and the punishments of the wicked. The part devoted to the Seven Sacraments teaches us what are the



                                                          32
signs, and, as it were, the instruments of grace. In the part on the Decalogue is described whatever has reference
to the law, whose end is charity. Finally, the Lord's Prayer contains whatever can be the object of the Christian's
desires, or hopes, or prayers. The exposition, therefore, of these four parts, which are, as it were, the general
heads of Sacred Scripture, includes almost everything that a Christian should learn.




How This Work Is To Be Used

We therefore deem it proper to inform pastors that, whenever they have occasion, in the ordinary discharge of
their duty, to expound any passage of the Gospel or any other part of Holy Scripture. they will find its subject-
matter treated under some one of the four heads already enumerated, to which they recur, as to the source from
which their instruction is to be drawn.

Thus, if the Gospel of the first Sunday of Advent is to be explained, There shall be signs in the sun, and in the
moon, etc., whatever regards its explanation is contained under the Article of the Creed, He shall come to judge
the living and the dead; and by embodying the substance of that Article in his exposition, the pastor will at once
instruct his people in the Creed and in the Gospel. Whenever, therefore, he has to communicate instruction and
expound the Scriptures, he will observe the same rule of referring all to these four principal heads under which,
as we observed, the whole teaching and doctrine of Holy Scripture is contained. As for order, however, he is
free to follow that which he deems best suited to the circumstances of persons and time.




                                          PART I : THE CREED



Faith

In preparing and instructing men in the teachings of Christ the Lord, the Fathers began by explaining the
meaning of faith. Following their example, we have thought it well to treat first what pertains to that virtue.

Though the word faith has a variety of meanings in the Sacred Scriptures, we here speak only of that faith by
which we yield our entire assent to whatever has been divinely revealed.




Necessity Of Faith

That faith thus understood is necessary to salvation no man can reasonably doubt, particularly since it is written:
Without faith it is impossible to please God. For as the end proposed to man as his ultimate happiness is far
above the reach of human understanding, it was therefore necessary that it should be made known to him by
God. This knowledge, however, is nothing else than faith, by which we yield our unhesitating assent to
whatever the authority of our Holy Mother the Church teaches us to have been revealed by God; for the faithful
cannot doubt those things of which God, who is truth itself, is the author. Hence we see the great difference that
exists between this faith which we give to God and that which we yield to the writers of human history.




Unity Of Faith




                                                        33
Faith differs in degree; for we read in Scripture these words: O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt; and
Great is thy faith; and Increase our faith. It also differs in dignity, for we read: Faith without works is dead; and,
Faith that worketh by charity. But although faith is so comprehensive, it is yet the same in kind, and the full
force of its definition applies equally to all its varieties. How fruitful it is and how great are the advantages we
may derive from it we shall point out when explaining the Articles of the Creed.




The Creed

Now the chief truths which Christians ought to hold are those which the holy Apostles, the leaders and teachers
of the faith, inspired by the Holy Ghost' have divided into the twelve Articles of the Creed. For having received
a command from the Lord to go forth into the whole world, as His ambassadors, and preach the Gospel to every
creature, they thought it advisable to draw up a formula of Christian faith, that all might think and speak the
same thing, and that among those whom they should have called to the unity of the faith no schisms would
exist, but that they should be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.

This profession of Christian faith and hope, drawn up by themselves, the Apostles called a symbol; either
because it was made up of various parts, each of which was contributed by an Apostle, or because by it, as by a
common sign and watchword, they might easily distinguish deserters from the faith and false brethren unawares
brought in, adulterating the word of God, from those who had truly bound themselves by oath to serve under the
banner of Christ.




Division Of The Creed

Christianity proposes to the faithful many truths which, either separately or in general, must be held with an
assured and firm faith. Among these what must first and necessarily be believed by all is that which God
Himself has taught us as the foundation and summary of truth concerning the unity of the Divine Essence, the
distinction of Three Persons, and the actions which are peculiarly attributed to each. The pastor should teach
that the Apostles, Creed briefly comprehends the doctrine of this mystery.

For, as has been observed by our predecessors in the faith, who have treated this subject with great piety and
accuracy, the Creed seems to be divided into three principal parts: one describing the First Person of the Divine
Nature, and the stupendous work of the creation; another, the Second Person, and the mystery of man's
redemption; a third, the Third Person, the head and source of our sanctification; the whole being expressed in
various and most appropriate propositions. These propositions are called Articles, from a comparison frequently
used by the Fathers; for as the members of the body are divided by joints (articuli), so in this profession of faith,
whatever is to be believed distinctly and separately from anything else is rightly and suitably called an Article.




   ARTICLE I : "I BELIEVE IN GOD, THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND
                                       EARTH"




Meaning Of This Article

The meaning of the above words is this: I believe with certainty, and without a shadow of doubt profess my
belief in God the Father, the First Person of the Trinity, who by His omnipotence created from nothing and
preserves and governs the heavens and the earth and all things which they contain; and not only do I believe in



                                                         34
Him from my heart and profess this belief with my lips, but with the greatest ardour and piety I tend towards
Him, as the supreme and most perfect good.

Let this serve as a brief summary of this first Article. But since great mysteries lie concealed under almost every
word, the pastor must now give them a more careful consideration, in order that, as far as God has permitted,
the faithful may approach, with fear and trembling, to contemplate the glory of His majesty.




"I Believe"

The word believe does not here mean to think, to suppose, lo be of opinion; but, as the Sacred Scriptures teach,
it expresses the deepest conviction, by which the mind gives a firm and unhesitating assent to God revealing His
mysterious truths. As far, therefore, as regards use of the word here, he who firmly and without hesitation is
convinced of anything is said to believe.




Faith Excludes Doubt

The knowledge derived through faith must not be considered less certain because its objects are not seen; for the
divine light by which we know them, although it does not render them evident, yet suffers us not to doubt them.
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath himself shone in our hearts, that the gospel be
not hidden to us, as to those that perish.




Faith Excludes Curiosity

From what has been said it follows that he who is gifted with this heavenly knowledge of faith is free from an
inquisitive curiosity. For when God commands us to believe He does not propose to us to search into His divine
judgments, or inquire into their reason and cause, but demands an unchangeable faith, by which the mind rests
content in the knowledge of eternal truth. And indeed, since we have the testimony of the Apostle that God is
true; and every man a liar, and since it would argue arrogance and presumption to disbelieve the word of a
grave and sensible man affirming anything as true, and to demand that he prove his statements by arguments or
witnesses, how rash and foolish are those, who, hearing the words of God Himself, demand reasons for His
heavenly and saving doctrines? Faith, therefore, must exclude not only all doubt, but all desire for
demonstration.




Faith Requires Open Profession

The pastor should also teach that he who says, I believe, besides declaring the inward assent of the mind, which
is an internal act of faith, should also openly profess and with alacrity acknowledge and proclaim what he
inwardly and in his heart believes. For the faithful should be animated by the same spirit that spoke by the lips
of the Prophet when he said: I believe; and therefore did I speak, and should follow the example of the Apostles
who replied to the princes of the people: We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. They
should be encouraged by these noble words of St. Paul: I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of
God unto salvation to every one that believeth; and likewise by those other words; in which the truth of this
doctrine is expressly confirmed: With the heart we believe unto justice; but with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation.




                                                        35
"In God"

From these words we may learn how exalted are the dignity and excellence of Christian wisdom, and what a
debt of gratitude we owe to the divine goodness. For to us it is given at once to mount as by the steps of faith to
the knowledge of what is most sublime and desirable.




Knowledge Of God More Easily Obtained Through Faith Than Through Reason

There is a great difference between Christian philosophy and human wisdom. The latter, guided solely by the
light of nature, advances slowly by reasoning on sensible objects and effects, and only after long and laborious
investigation is it able at length to contemplate with difficulty the invisible things of God, to discover and
understand a First Cause and Author of all things. Christian philosophy, on the contrary, so quickens the human
mind that without difficulty it pierces the heavens, and, illumined with divine light, contemplates first, the
eternal source of light, and in its radiance all created things: so that we experience with the utmost pleasure of
mind that we have been called, as the Prince of the Apostles says, out of darkness into his admirable light, and
believing we rejoice with joy unspeakable.

Justly, therefore, do the faithful profess first to believe in God, whose majesty, with the Prophet Jeremias, we
declare incomprehensible. For, as the Apostle says, He dwells in light inaccessible, which no man hath seen, nor
can see; as God Himself, speaking to Moses, said: No man shall see my face and live. The mind cannot rise to
the contemplation of the Deity, whom nothing approaches in sublimity, unless it be entirely disengaged from
the senses, and of this in the present life we art naturally incapable.




Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is Clearer

But while this is so, yet God, as the Apostle says, left not himself without testimony, doing good from heaven,
giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. Hence it is that the philosophers
conceived no mean idea of the Divinity, ascribed to Him nothing corporeal, gross or composite. They
considered Him the perfection and fullness of all good, from whom, as from an eternal, inexhaustible fountain
of goodness and benignity, flows every perfect gift to all creatures. They called Him the wise, the author and
lover of truth, the just, the most beneficent, and gave Him also many other appellations expressive of supreme
and absolute perfection. They recognised that His immense and infinite power fills every place and extends to
all things

These truths the Sacred Scriptures express far better and much more clearly, as in the following passages: God
is a spirit; Be ye perfect, even as also your heavenly Father is perfect; All things are naked and open to his eyes;
O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! God is true; I am the way, the truth, and
the life; Thy right hand is full of justice; Thou openest thy hand, and fillest with blessing every living creature;
and finally: Whither shall go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy face? If I ascend into heaven, thou
art there; if I descend into hell, thou art there. If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea, etc., and Do I not fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?




Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is More Certain




                                                        36
These great and sublime truths regarding the nature of God, which are in full accord with Scripture, the
philosophers were able to learn from an investigation of God's works. But even here we see the necessity of
divine revelation if we reflect that not only does faith, as we have already observed, make known clearly and at
once to the rude and unlettered, those truths which only the learned could discover, and that by long study; but
also that the knowledge obtained through faith is much more certain and more secure against error than if it
were the result of philosophical inquiry.




Knowledge Of God Obtained Through Faith Is More Ample And Exalted

But how much more exalted must not that knowledge of the Deity be considered, which cannot be acquired in
common by all from the contemplation of nature, but is peculiar to those who are illumined by the light of faith
?

This knowledge is contained in the Articles of the Creed, which disclose to us the unity of the Divine Essence
and the distinction of Three Persons, and show also that God Himself is the ultimate end of our being, from
whom we are to expect the enjoyment of the eternal happiness of heaven, according to the words of St. Paul:
God is a rewarder of them that seek Him. How great are these rewards, and whether they are such that human
knowledge could aspire to their attainment, we learn from these words of Isaias uttered long before those of the
Apostle: From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears: the eye hath not
seen besides thee, O God, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.




The Unity Of Nature In God

From what is said it must also be confessed that there is but one God, not many gods. For we attribute to God
supreme goodness and infinite perfection, and it is impossible that what? is supreme and most perfect could be
common to many. If a being lack anything that constitutes supreme perfection, it is therefore imperfect and
cannot have the nature of God.

The unity of God is also proved from many passages of Sacred Scripture. It is written: Hear, O Israel, the Lord
our God is one Lord; again the Lord commands: Thou shalt not have strange gods before me; and further He
often admonishes us by the Prophet: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God. The
Apostle also openly declares: One Lord, one faith, one baptism.

It should not, however, excite our surprise if the Sacred Scriptures sometimes give the name of God to
creatures. For when they call the Prophets and judges gods, they do not speak according to the manner of the
Gentiles, who, in their folly and impiety, formed to themselves many gods; but express, by a manner of
speaking then in use, some eminent quality or function conferred on such persons by the gift of God.




The Trinity Of Persons In God

The Christian faith, therefore, believes and professes, as is declared in the Nicene Creed in confirmation of this
truth, that God in His Nature, Substance and Essence is one.- But soaring still higher, it so understands Him to
be one that it adores unity in trinity and trinity in unity. Of this mystery we now proceed to speak, as it comes
next in order in the Creed.




                                                        37
"The Father"

As God is called Father for more reasons than one, we must first determine the more appropriate sense in which
the word is used in the present instance.




God Is Called Father Because He Is Creator And Ruler

Even some on whose darkness the light of faith never shone conceived God to be an eternal substance from
whom all things have their beginning, and by whose Providence they are governed and preserved in their order
and state of existence. Since, therefore, he to whom a family owes its origin and by whose wisdom

derived from human things these persons gave the name Father to God, whom they acknowledge to be the
Creator and Governor of the universe. The Sacred Scriptures also, when they wish to show that to God must be
ascribed the creation of all things, supreme power and admirable Providence, make use of the same name. Thus
we read: Is not he thy Father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee and created thee? And: Have we not all
one Father? hath not one God created us?




God Is Called Father Because He Adopts Christians Through Grace

But God, particularly in the New Testament, is much more frequently, and in some sense peculiarly, called the
Father of Christians, who have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but have received the spirit of
adoption of sons (of God), whereby they cry: Abba (Father). For the Father hath bestowed upon us that manner
of charity that we should be called, and be the sons of God, and if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ, who is the first-born amongst many brethren, and is not ashamed to call us brethren.
Whether, therefore, we look to the common title of creation and Providence, or to the special one of spiritual
adoption, rightly do the faithful profess their belief that God is their Father.




The Name Father Also Discloses The Plurality Of Persons In God

But the pastor should teach that on hearing the word Father, besides the ideas already unfolded, the mind should
rise to more exalted mysteries. Under the name Father, the divine oracles begin to unveil to us a mysterious
truth which is more abstruse and more deeply hidden in that inaccessible light in which God dwells, and which
human reason and understanding could not attain to, nor even conjecture to exist.

This name implies that in the one Essence of the Godhead is proposed to our belief, not only one Person, but a
distinction of persons; for in one Divine Nature there are Three Persons-the Father, begotten of none; the Son,
begotten of the Father before all ages; the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the likewise, from all
eternity




The Doctrine Of The Trinity

In the one Substance of the Divinity the Father is the First Person, who with His Only-begotten Son, and the
Holy Ghost, is one God and one Lord, not in the singularity of one Person, but in the trinity of one Substance.
These Three Persons, since it would be impiety to assert that they are unlike or unequal in any thing, are
understood to be distinct only in their respective properties. For the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten of


                                                       38
the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from both. Thus we acknowledge the Essence and the Substance of the
Three Persons to be the same in such wise that we believe that in confessing the true and eternal God we are
piously and religiously to adore distinction in the Persons, unity in the Essence, and equality in the Trinity.

Hence, when we say that the Father is the First Person, we are not to be understood to mean that in the Trinity
there is anything first or last, greater or less. Let none of the faithful be guilty of such impiety, for the Christian
religion proclaims the same eternity, the same majesty of glory in the Three Persons. But since the Father is the
Beginning without a beginning, we truly and unhesitatingly affirm that He is the First Person, and as He is
distinct from the Others by His peculiar relation of paternity, so of Him alone is it true that He begot the Son
from eternity. For when in the Creed we pronounce together the words God and Father, it means that He was
always both God and Father.




Practical Admonitions Concerning The Mystery Of The Trinity

Since nowhere is a too curious inquiry more dangerous, or error more fatal, than in the knowledge and
exposition of this, the most profound and difficult of mysteries, let the pastor teach that the terms nature and
person used to express this mystery should be most scrupulously retained; and let the faithful know that unity
belongs to essence, and distinction to persons.

But these are truths which should not be made the subject of too subtle investigation, when we recollect that he
who is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory. We should be satisfied with the assurance and
certitude which faith gives us that we have been taught these truths by God Himself, to doubt whose word is the
extreme of folly and misery. He has said: Teach ye all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and again, there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.

Let him, however, who by the divine bounty believes these truths, constantly beseech and implore God and the
Father, who made all things out of nothing, and ordereth an things sweetly, who gave us power to become the
sons of God, and who made known to the human mind the mystery of the Trinity -- let him, I say, pray
unceasingly that, admitted one day into the eternal tabernacles, he may be worthy to see how great is the
fecundity of the Father, who contemplating and understanding Himself, begot the Son like and equal to
Himself, how a love of charity in both, entirely the same and equal, which is the Holy Ghost, proceeding from
the Father and the Son, connects the begetter and the begotten by an eternal and indissoluble bond; and that thus
the Essence of the Trinity is one and the distinction of the Three Persons perfect.




"Almighty"

The Sacred Scriptures, in order to mark the piety and devotion with which the most holy name of God is to be
adored, usually express His supreme power and infinite majesty in a variety of ways; but the pastor should, first
of all, teach that almighty power is most frequently attributed to Him. Thus He says of Himself: I am the
almighty Lord and again, Jacob when sending his sons to Joseph thus prayed for them: May my almighty God
make him favourable to you. In the Apocalypse also it is written: The Lord God, who is, and who was, and who
is to come, the almighty; and in another place the last day is called the great day of the almighty God.
Sometimes the same attribute is expressed in many words; thus: No word shall be impossible with God; Is the
hand of the Lord unable? Thy power is at hand when thou wiIt, and so on.




Meaning Of The Term Almighty"



                                                          39
From these various modes of expression it is clearly perceived what is comprehended under this single word
almighty. By it we understand that there neither exists nor can be conceived in thought or imagination anything
which God cannot do. For not only can He annihilate all created things, and in a moment summon from nothing
into existence many other worlds, an exercise of power which, however great, comes in some degree within our
comprehension; but He can do many things still greater, of which the human mind can form no conception.

But though God can do all things, yet He cannot lie, or deceive, or be deceived; He cannot sin, or cease to exist,
or be ignorant of anything. These defects are compatible with those beings only whose actions are imperfect;
but God, whose acts are always most perfect, is said to be incapable of such things, simply because the
capability of doing them implies weakness, not the supreme and infinite power over all things which God
possesses. Thus we so believe God to be omnipotent that we exclude from Him entirely all that is not intimately
connected and consistent with the perfection of His nature.




Why Omnipotence Alone Is Mentioned In The: Creed

The pastor should point out the propriety and wisdom of having omitted all other names of God in the Creed,
and of having proposed to us only that of almighty as the object of our belief. For by acknowledging God to be
omnipotent, we also of necessity acknowledge Him to be omniscient, and to hold all things in subjection to His
supreme authority and dominion. When we do not doubt that He is omnipotent, we must be also convinced of
everything else regarding Him, the absence of which would render His omnipotence altogether unintelligible.

Besides, nothing tends more to confirm our faith and animate our hope than a deep conviction that all things are
possible to God; for whatever may be afterwards proposed as an object of faith, however great, however
wonderful, however raised above the natural order, is easily and without hesitation believed, once the mind has
grasped the knowledge of the omnipotence of God. Nay more, the greater the truths which the divine oracles
announce, the more willingly does the mind deem them worthy of belief. And should we expect any favour
from heaven, we are not discouraged by the greatness of the desired benefit, but are cheered and confirmed by
frequently considering that there is nothing which an omnipotent God cannot effect.




Advantages Of Faith In God’s Omnipotence

With this faith, then, we should be specially fortified whenever we are required to render any extraordinary
service to our neighbour or seek to obtain by prayer any favour from God. Its necessity in the one case we learn
from the Lord Himself, who, when rebuking the incredulity of the Apostles, said: If you have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence thither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall
be impossible to you; and in the other case, from these words of St. James: Let him ask in faith, nothing
wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.
Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.

This faith brings with it also many advantages and helps. It forms us, in the first place, to all humility and
lowliness of mind, according to these words of the Prince of the Apostles: Be you humbled therefore under the
mighty hand of God. It also teaches us not to fear where there is no cause of fear, but to fear God alone, in
whose power we ourselves and all that we have are placed; for our Saviour says: I will shew you whom you
shall fear; fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. This faith is also useful to enable us
to know and exalt the infinite mercies of God towards us. For he who reflects on the omnipotence of God,
cannot be so ungrateful as not frequently to exclaim: He that is mighty, hath done great things to me.

Not Three Almighties But One Almighty

When, however, in this Article we call the Father almighty, let no one be led into the error of thinking that this
attribute is so ascribed to Him as not to belong also to the Son and the Holy Ghost. As we say the Father is God,
the Son is God, the Holy Ghost is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God; so in like manner we
confess that the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty, and yet there are not three
almighties but one almighty.

The Father, in particular, we call almighty, because He is the Source of all being; as we also attribute wisdom to
the Son, because He is the eternal Word of the Father; and goodness to the Holy Ghost, because He is the love
of both. These, however, and similar appellations, may be given indiscriminately to the Three Persons,
according to the teaching of Catholic faith.




"Creator"

The necessity of having previously imparted to the faithful a knowledge of the omnipotence of God will appear
from what we are now about to explain with regard to the creation of the world. The wondrous production of so
stupendous a work is more easily believed when all doubt concerning the immense power of the Creator has
been removed.

For God formed the world not from materials of any sort, but created it from nothing, and that not by constraint
or necessity, but spontaneously, and of His own free will. Nor was He impelled to create by any other cause
than a desire to communicate His goodness to creatures. Being essentially happy in Himself He stands not in
need of anything, as David expresses it: I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my
goods.

As it was His own goodness that influenced Him when He did all things whatsoever He would, so in the work
of creation He followed no external form or model; but contemplating, and as it were imitating, the universal
model contained in the divine intelligence, the supreme Architect, with infinite wisdom and power-attributes
peculiar to the Divinity -- created all things in the be ginning. He spoke and they were made: he commanded
and they were created.




"Of Heaven and Earth"

The words heaven and earth include all things which the heaven's and the earth contain; for besides the heavens,
which the Prophet has called the works of his fingers, He also gave to the sun its brilliancy, and to the moon and
stars their beauty; and that they might be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years. He so ordered the
celestial bodies in a certain and uniform course, that nothing varies more than their continual revolution, while
nothing is more fixed than their variety.




Creation Of The World Of Spirits

Moreover, He created out of nothing the spiritual world and Angels innumerable to serve and minister to Him;
and these He enriched and adorned with the admirable gifts of His grace and power.

That the devil and the other rebel angels were gifted from the beginning of their creation with grace, clearly
follows from these words of the Sacred Scriptures: He (the devil) stood not in the truth. On this subject St.


                                                        41
Augustine says: In creating the Angels He endowed them with good will, that is, with pure love that they might
adhere to Him, giving them existence and adorning them with grace at one and the same time. Hence we are to
believe that the holy Angels were never without good will, that is, the love of God.

As to their knowledge we have this testimony of Holy Scripture: Thou, my Lord, O king, art wise, according to
the wisdom of an angel of God, to understand all things upon earth.' Finally, the inspired David ascribes power
to them, saying that they are mighty in strength, and execute his word; and on this account they are often called
in Scripture the powers and the armies of the Lord.

But although they were all endowed with celestial gifts, very many, having rebelled against God, their Father
and Creator, were hurled from those high mansions of bliss, and shut up in the darkest dungeon of earth, there
to suffer for eternity the punishment of their pride. Speaking of them the Prince of the Apostles says: God
spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments,
to be reserved unto judgment.




Formation Of The Universe

The earth also God commanded to stand in the midst of the world, rooted in its own foundation, and made the
mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which he had founded for them. That the waters should
not inundate the earth, He set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the
earth. He next not only clothed and adorned it with trees and every variety of plant and flower, but filled it, as
He had already filled the air and water, with innumerable kinds of living creatures.




Production Of Man

Lastly, He formed man from the slime of the earth, so created and constituted in body as to be immortal and
impassible, not, however, by the strength of nature, but by the bounty of God. Man's soul He created to His own
image and likeness; gifted him with free will, and tempered all his motions and appetites so as to subject them,
at all times, to the dictates of reason. He then added the admirable gift of original righteousness, and next gave
him dominion over all other animals. By referring to the sacred history of Genesis the pastor will easily make
himself familiar with these things for the instruction of the faithful.




"Of all Things Visible and Invisible"

What we have said, then, of the creation of the universe is to be understood as conveyed by the words heaven
and earth, and is thus briefly set forth by the Prophet: Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world
and the fullness thereof thou hast founded. Still more briefly the Fathers of the Council of Nice expressed this
truth by adding in their Creed these words: of all things visible and invisible. Whatever exists in the universe,
whatever we confess to have been created by God, either falls under the senses and is included in the word
visible, or is an object of mental perception and intelligence and is expressed by the word invisible.




God Preserves, Rules And Moves All Created Things

We are not, however, to understand that God is in such wise the Creator and Maker of all things that His works,
when once created and finished, could thereafter continue to exist unsupported by His omnipotence. For as all


                                                        42
things derive existence from the Creator's supreme power, wisdom, and goodness, so unless preserved
continually by His Providence, and by the same power which produced them, they would instantly return into
their nothingness. This the Scriptures declare when they say: How could anything endure if thou wouldst not?
or be preserved, if not called by thee?

Not only does God protect and govern all things by His Providence, but He also by an internal power impels to
motion and action whatever moves and acts, and this in such a manner that, although He excludes not, He yet
precedes the agency of secondary causes. For His invisible influence extends to all things, and, as the Wise Man
says, reaches from end to end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly. This is the reason why the Apostle,
announcing to the Athenians the God whom, not knowing, they adored, said: He is not far from every one of us:
for in him we live, and move, and are.




Creation Is The Work Of The Three Persons

Let so much suffice for the explanation of the first Article of the Creed. It may not be superfluous, however, to
add that creation is the common work of the Three Persons of the Holy and undivided Trinity, -- of the Father,
whom according to the doctrine of the Apostles we here declare to be Creator of heaven and earth; of the Son,
of whom the Scripture says, all things were made by him; and of the Holy Ghost, of whom it is written: The
spirit of God moved over the waters, and again, By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all
the power of them by the spirit of his mouth.




                ARTICLE II : "AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY SON, OUR LORD"




Advantages Of Faith In This Article

That wonderful and superabundant are the blessings which flow to the human race from the belief and
profession of this Article we learn from these words of St. John: Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son
of God, God abideth in him, and he in God; and also from the words of Christ the Lord, proclaiming the Prince
of the Apostles blessed for the confession of this truth: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood
hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. For this Article is the most firm basis of our
salvation and redemption.

But as the fruit of these admirable blessings is best known by considering the ruin brought on man by his fall
from that most happy state in which God had placed our first parents, let the pastor be particularly careful to
make known to the faithful the cause of this common misery and calamity.

When Adam had departed from the obedience due to God and had violated the prohibition, of every tree of
paradise thou shalt eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat, for in what day soever
thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death, he fell into the extreme misery of losing the sanctity and
righteousness in which he had been placed, and of becoming subject to all those other evils which have been
explained more fully by the holy Council of Trent.

Wherefore, the pastor should not omit to remind the faithful that the guilt and punishment of original sin were
not confined to Adam, but justly descended from him, as from their source and cause, to all posterity. The
human race, having fallen from its elevated dignity, no power of men or Angels could raise it from its fallen
condition and replace it in its primitive state. To remedy the evil and repair the loss it became necessary that the




                                                        43
Son of God, whose power is infinite, clothed in the weakness of our flesh, should remove the infinite weight of
sin and reconcile us to God in His blood.




Necessity Of Faith In This Article

The belief and profession of this our redemption, which God declared from the beginning, are now, and always
have been, necessary to salvation. In the sentence of condemnation pronounced against the human race
immediately after the sin of Adam the hope of redemption was held out in these words, which announced to the
devil the loss he was to sustain by man's redemption: I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy
seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait f or her heel.

The same promise God again often confirmed and more distinctly manifested to those chiefly whom He desired
to make special objects of His favour; among others to the Patriarch Abraham, to whom He often declared this
mystery, but more explicitly when, in obedience to His command, Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his only
son Isaac. Because, said God, thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only-begotten son f or my sake;
I win bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore. Thy
seed shall possess the gates of their enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,
because thou hast obeyed my voice. From these words it was easy to infer that He who was to deliver mankind
from the ruthless tyranny of Satan was to be descended from Abraham; and that while He was the Son of God,
He was to be born of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh.

Not long after, to preserve the memory of this promise, God renewed the same covenant with Jacob, the
grandson of Abraham. When in a vision Jacob saw a ladder standing on earth, and its top reaching to heaven,
and the angels of God ascending and descending by it, as the Scriptures testify, he also heard the Lord, who was
leaning on the ladder, say to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land,
wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth. Thou
shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and thy seed all
the nations of the earth shall be blessed.

Nor did God cease afterwards to excite in the posterity of Abraham and in many others, the expectation of a
Saviour, by renewing the recollection of the same promise; for after the establishment of the Jewish State and
religion it became better known to His people. Types signified and men foretold what and how great blessings
the Saviour and Redeemer, Christ Jesus, was to bring to mankind. And indeed the Prophets, whose minds were
illuminated with light from above, foretold the birth of the Son of God, the wondrous works which He wrought
while on earth, His doctrine, character, life, death, Resurrection, and the other mysterious circumstances
regarding Him, and all these they announced to the people as graphically as if they were passing before their
eyes. With the exception that one has reference to the future and the other to the past, we can discover no
difference between the predictions of the Prophets and the preaching of the Apostles, between the faith of the
ancient Patriarchs and that of Christians.

But we are now to speak of the several parts of this Article.




"Jesus"

Jesus is the proper name of the God-man and signifies Saviour: a name given Him not accidentally, or by the
judgment or will of man, but by the counsel and command of God. For the Angel announced to Mary His
mother: Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
He afterwards not only commanded Joseph, who was espoused to the Virgin, to call the child by that name, but
also declared the reason why He should be so called. Joseph, son of David, said the Angel, fear not to take unto



                                                        44
thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son and
thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins.

In the Sacred Scriptures we meet with many who were called by this name. So, for example, was called the son
of Nave, who succeeded Moses, and, by special privilege denied to Moses, conducted into the land of promise
the people whom Moses had delivered from Egypt; and also the son of Josedech, the priest. But how much
more appropriate it is to call by this name our Saviour, who gave light, liberty and salvation, not to one people
only, but to all men, of all ages to men oppressed, not by famine, or Egyptian or Babylonian bondage, but
sitting in the shadow of death and fettered by the galling chains of sin and of the devil who purchased for them a
right to the inheritance of heaven and reconciled them to God the Father! In those men who were designated by
the same name we see foreshadowed Christ the Lord, by whom the blessings just enumerated were poured out
on the human race.

All other names which according to prophecy were to be given by divine appointment to the Son of God, are
comprised in this one name Jesus; for while they partially signified the salvation which He was to bestow upon
us, this name included the force and meaning of all human salvation.




"Christ"

To the name Jesus is added that of Christ, which signifies the anointed. This name is expressive of honour and
office, and is not peculiar to one thing only, but common to many; for in the Old Law priests and kings, whom
God, on account of the dignity of their office, commanded to he anointed, were called christs. For priests
commend the people to God by unceasing prayer, offer sacrifice to Him, and turn away His wrath from
mankind. Kings are entrusted with the government of the people; and to them principally belong the authority of
the law, the protection of innocence and the punishment of guilt. As, therefore, both these functions seem to
represent the majesty of God on earth, those who were appointed to the royal or sacerdotal office were anointed
with oil. Furthermore, since Prophets, as the interpreters and ambassadors of the immortal God, have unfolded
to us the secrets of heaven and by salutary precepts and the prediction of future events have exhorted to
amendment of life, it was customary to anoint them also.

When Jesus Christ our Saviour came into the world, He assumed these three characters of Prophet, Priest and
King, and was therefore called Christ, having been anointed for the discharge of these functions, not by mortal
hand or with earthly ointment, but by the power of His heavenly Father and with a spiritual oil; for the plenitude
of the Holy Spirit and a more copious effusion of all gifts than any other created being is capable of receiving
were poured into His soul. This the Prophet clearly indicates when he addresses the Redeemer in these words:
Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows. The same is also more explicitly declared by the Prophet Isaias: The spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me: he hath sent me to preach to the meek.

Jesus Christ, therefore, was the great Prophet and Teacher, from whom we have learned the will of God and by
whom the world has been taught the knowledge of the heavenly Father. The name prophet belongs to Him
preeminently, because all others who were dignified with that name were His disciples, sent principally to
announce the coming of that Prophet who was to save all men.

Christ was also a Priest, not indeed of the same order as were the priests of the tribe of Levi in the Old Law, but
of that of which the Prophet David sang: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. This
subject the Apostle fully and accurately develops in his Epistle to the Hebrews.

Christ not only as God, but also as man and partaker of our nature, we acknowledge to be a King. Of Him the
Angel testified: He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end. This
kingdom of Christ is spiritual and eternal, begun on earth but perfected in heaven. He discharges by His
admirable Providence the duties of King towards His Church, governing and protecting her against the assaults



                                                        45
and snares of her enemies, legislating for her and imparting to her not only holiness and righteousness, but also
the power and strength to persevere. But although the good and the bad are found within the limits of this
kingdom, and thus all men by right belong to it, yet those who in conformity with His commands lead unsullied
and innocent lives, experience beyond all others the sovereign goodness and beneficence of our King. Although
descended from the most illustrious race of kings, He obtained this kingdom not by hereditary or other human
right, but because God bestowed on Him as man all the power, dignity and majesty of which human nature is
capable. To Him, therefore, God delivered the government of the whole world, and to this His sovereignty,
which has already commenced, all things shall be made fully and entirely subject on the day of judgment.




"His Only Son"

In these words, mysteries more exalted with regard to Jesus are proposed to the faithful as objects of their belief
and contemplation; namely, that He is the Son of God, and true God, like the Father who begot Him from
eternity. We also confess that He is the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, equal in all things to the Father
and the Holy Ghost; for in the Divine Persons nothing unequal or unlike should exist, or even be imagined to
exist, since we acknowledge the essence, will and power of all to be one. This truth is both clearly revealed in
many passages of Holy Scripture and sublimely announced in the testimony of St. John: In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

But when we are told that Jesus is the Son of God, we are not to understand anything earthly or mortal in His
birth; but are firmly to believe and piously to adore that birth by which, from all eternity, the Father begot the
Son, a mystery which reason cannot fully conceive or comprehend, and at the contemplation of which,
overwhelmed, as it were, with admiration, we should exclaim with the Prophet: Who shall declare his
generation? On this point, then, we are to believe that the Son is of the same nature, of the same power and
wisdom, with the Father, as we more fully profess in these words of the Nicene Creed: And in one Lord Jesus
Christ, his Only-begotten Son, born of the Father before all ages, God of God, light of light, true God of true
God, begotten, not made, consubstantial to the Father, by whom all things were made.

Among the different comparisons employed to elucidate the mode and manner of this eternal generation that
which is borrowed from the production of thought in our mind seems to come nearest to its illustration, and
hence St. John calls the Son the Word. For as our mind, in some sort understanding itself, forms an image of
itself, which theologians express by the term word, so God, as far as we may compare human things to divine,
understanding Himself, begets the eternal Word. It is better, however, to contemplate what faith proposes, and
in the sincerity of our souls to believe and confess that Jesus Christ is true God and true Man, as God, begotten
of the Father before all ages, as Man, born in time of Mary, His Virgin Mother.

While we thus acknowledge His twofold Nativity; we believe Him to be one Son, because His divine and
human natures meet in one Person. As to His divine generation He has no brethren or coheirs, being the Only-
begotten Son of the Father, while we mortals are the work of His hands. But if we consider His birth as man, He
not only calls many by the name of brethren, but treats them as such, since He admits them to share with Him
the glory of His paternal inheritance. They are those who by faith have received Christ the Lord, and who really,
and by works of charity, show forth the faith which they profess in words. Hence the Apostle calls Christ, the
first-born amongst many brethren.




"Our Lord"

Of our Saviour many things are recorded in Sacred Scripture. Some of these, it is evident, apply to Him as God
and some as man, because from His two natures He received the different properties which belong to both.
Hence we say with truth that Christ is Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, and these attributes He has from His Divine




                                                         46
Nature; again, we say of Him that He suffered, died, and rose again, which are properties manifestly that belong
to His human nature.

Besides these terms, there are others common to both natures; as when in this Article of the Creed we say our
Lord. If, then, this name applies to both natures, rightly is He to be called our Lord. For as He, as well as the
Father, is the eternal God, so is He Lord of all things equally with the Father; and as He and the Father are not
the one, one God, and the other, another God, but one and the same God, so likewise He and the Father are not
the one, one Lord, and the other, another Lord.

As man, He is also for many reasons appropriately called our Lord. First, because He is our Redeemer, who
delivered us from sin, He deservedly acquired the power by which He truly is and is called our Lord. This is the
doctrine of the Apostle:

                  He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. For which
                  cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names: that at
                  the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the
                  earth: and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God
                  the Father. And of Himself He said, after His Resurrection: All power is given to me in
                  heaven and in earth.

He is also called Lord because in one Person both natures, the human and the divine, are united; and even
though He had not died for us, He would have yet deserved, by this admirable union, to be constituted common
Lord of all created things, particularly of the faithful who obey and serve Him with all the fervour of their souls.




Duties Owed To Christ Our Lord

It remains, therefore, that the pastor remind the faithful that: from Christ we take our name and are called
Christians; that we cannot be ignorant of the extent of His favours, particularly since by His gift of faith we are
enabled to understand all these things. We, above all others, are under the obligation of devoting and
consecrating ourselves forever, like faithful servants, to our Redeemer and our Lord.

This indeed, we promised at the doors of the church when about to be baptised; for we then declared that we
renounced the devil and the world, and gave ourselves unreservedly to Jesus Christ. But if to be enrolled as
soldiers of Christ we consecrated ourselves by so holy and solemn a profession to our Lord, what punishments
should we not deserve if after our entrance into the Church, and after having known the will and laws of God
and received the grace of the Sacraments, we were to form our lives upon the precepts and maxims of the world
and the devil, just as though when cleansed in the waters of Baptism, we had pledged our fidelity to the world
and to the devil, and not to Christ the Lord and Saviour!

What heart so cold as not to be inflamed with love by the kindness and good will exercised toward us by so
great a Lord, who, though holding us in His power and dominion as slaves ransomed by His blood, yet
embraces us with such ardent love as to call us not servants, but friends and brethren? This, assuredly, supplies
the most just, and perhaps the strongest, claim to induce us always to acknowledge, venerate, and adore Him as
our Lord.




    ARTICLE III : "WHO WAS CONCEIVED BY THE HOLY GHOST, BORN OF THE VIRGIN
                                    MARY"




                                                        47
Importance Of This Article

From what has been said in the preceding Article, the faithful can understand that in bringing us from the
relentless tyranny of Satan into liberty, God has conferred a singular and surpassing blessing on the human race.
But if we place before our eyes also the plan and means by which He deigned chiefly to accomplish this, then,
indeed, we shall see that there is nothing more glorious or magnificent than this divine goodness and
beneficence towards us.




First Part of this Article: "Who was Conceived,'

The pastor, then, should enter on the exposition of this third Article by developing the grandeur of this mystery,
which the Sacred Scriptures very frequently propose for our consideration as the principal source of our eternal
salvation. Its meaning he should teach to be that we believe and confess that the same Jesus Christ, our only
Lord, the Son of God, when He assumed human flesh for us in the womb of the Virgin, was not conceived like
other men, from the seed of man, but in a manner transcending the order of nature, that is, by the power of the
Holy Ghost; so that the same Person, remaining God as He was from eternity, became man, what He was not
before.

That such is the meaning of the above words is clear from the Creed of the Holy Council of Constantinople,
which says: Who for us men, and for our salvation,, came down from heaven, and became incarnate by the Holy
Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man. The same truth we also find unfolded by St. John the Evangelist,
who imbibed from the bosom of the Lord and Saviour Himself the knowledge of this most profound mystery.
For when he had declared the nature of the Divine Word as follows: In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God, he concluded: And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

The Word, which is a Person of the Divine Nature, assumed human nature in such a manner that there should be
one and the same Person in both the divine and human natures. Hence this admirable union preserved the
actions and properties of both natures; and as Pope St. Leo the Great said: The lowliness of the inferior nature
was not consumed in the glory of the superior, nor did the assumption of the inferior lessen the glory of the
superior.




"By the Holy Ghost"

As an explanation of the words in which this Article is expressed is not to be omitted, the pastor should teach
that when we say that the Son of God was conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, we do not mean that this
Person alone of the Holy Trinity accomplished the mystery of the Incarnation. Although the Son only assumed
human nature, yet all the Persons of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, were authors of this
mystery.

It is a principle of Christian faith that whatever God does outside Himself in creation is common to the Three
Persons, and that one neither does more than, nor acts without another. But that one emanates from another, this
only cannot be common to all; for the Son is begotten of the Father only, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father and the Son. Anything, however, which proceeds from them extrinsically is the work of the Three
Persons without difference of any sort, and of this latter description is the Incarnation of the Son of God.

Of those things, nevertheless, that are common to all, the Sacred Scriptures-often attribute some to one person,
some to another. Thus, to the Father they attribute power over all things ; to the Son, wisdom; to the Holy
Ghost, love. Hence, as the mystery of the Incarnation manifests the singular and boundless love of God towards
us, it is therefore in some sort peculiarly attributed to the Holy Ghost.



                                                       48
In The Incarnation Some Things Were Natural, Others Supernatural

In this mystery we perceive that some things were done which transcend the order of nature, some by the power
of nature. Thus, in believing that the body of Christ was formed from the most pure blood of His Virgin Mother
we acknowledge the operation of human nature, this being a law common to the formation of all human bodies,
that they should be formed from the blood of the mother.

But what surpasses the order of nature and human comprehension is, that as soon as the Blessed Virgin assented
to the announcement of the Angel in these words, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me
according to thy word, the most sacred body of Christ was immediately formed, and to it was united a rational
soul enjoying the use of reason; and thus in the same instant of time He was perfect God and perfect man. That
this was the astonishing and admirable work of the Holy Ghost cannot be doubted; for according to the order of
nature the rational soul is united to the body only after a certain lapse of time.

Again -- and this should overwhelm us with astonishment -- as soon as the soul of Christ was united to His
body, the Divinity became united to both; and thus at the same time His body was formed and animated, and the
Divinity united to body and soul.

Hence, at the same instant He was perfect God and perfect man, and the most Holy Virgin, having at the same
moment conceived God and man, is truly and properly called Mother of God and man. This the Angel signified
to her when he said: Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his
name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High. The event verified the prophecy of
Isaias: Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son. Elizabeth also declared the same truth when" being filled
with the Holy Ghost, she understood the Conception of the Son of God, and said: Whence is this to me, that the
mother of my Lord should come to me?

As the body of Christ was formed of the pure blood of the immaculate Virgin without the aid of man, as we
have already said, and by the sole operation of the Holy Ghost, so also, at the moment of His Conception, His
soul was enriched with an overflowing fullness of the Spirit of God, and a superabundance of all graces. For
God gave not to Him, as to others adorned with holiness and grace, His Spirit by measure, as St. John testifies
but poured into His soul the plenitude of all graces so abundantly that of his fullness we all have received.

Although possessing that Spirit by which holy men attain the adoption of sons of God, He cannot, however, be
called the adopted son of God; for since He is the Son of God by nature, the grace, or name of adoption, can on
no account be deemed applicable to Him.




How To Profit By The Mystery Of The Incarnation

These truths comprise the substance of what appears to demand explanation regarding the admirable mystery of
the Conception. To reap from them abundant fruit for salvation the faithful should particularly recall, and
frequently reflect, that it is God who assumed human flesh; that the manner in which He became man exceeds
our comprehension, not to say our powers of expression; and finally, that He vouchsafed to become man in
order that we men might be born again as children of God. When to these subjects they shall have given mature
consideration, let them, in the humility of faith, believe and adore all the mysteries contained in this Article, and
not indulge a curious inquisitiveness by investigating and scrutinising them -- an attempt scarcely ever
unattended with danger.




                                                         49
Second Part Of This Article: "Born Of The Virgin Mary"

These words comprise another part of this Article. In its exposition the pastor should exercise considerable
diligence, because the faithful are bound to believe that Jesus the Lord was not only conceived by the power of
the Holy Ghost, but was also born of the Virgin Mary. The words of the Angel who first announced the happy
tidings to the world declare with what joy and delight of soul this mystery of our faith should be meditated
upon. Behold, said the Angel, I bring you good tidings of great joy" that shall be to all the people. The same
sentiments are clearly conveyed in the song chanted by the heavenly host: Glory to God in the highest; and on
earth peace to men of good will. Then began the fulfilment of the splendid promise made by God to Abraham"
that in his seed all the nations of the earth should one day be blessed; for Mary" whom we truly proclaim and
venerate as Mother of God, because she brought forth Him who is at once God and man, was descended from
King David.




The Nativity Of Christ Transcends The Order Of Nature

But as the Conception itself transcends the order of nature, so also the birth of our Lord presents to our
contemplation nothing but what is divine.

Besides, what is admirable beyond the power of thoughts or words to express, He is born of His Mother without
any diminution of her maternal virginity, just as He afterwards went forth from the sepulchre while it was
closed and sealed, and entered the room in which His disciples were assembled, the doors being shut; or, not to
depart from every-day examples, just as the rays of the sun penetrate without breaking or injuring in the least
the solid substance of glass, so after a like but more exalted manner did Jesus Christ come forth from His
mother's womb without injury to her maternal virginity. This immaculate and perpetual virginity forms,
therefore, the just theme of our eulogy. Such was the work of the Holy Ghost, who at the Conception and birth
of the Son so favoured the Virgin Mother as to impart to her fecundity while preserving inviolate her perpetual
virginity.




Christ Compared to Adam" Mary to Eve

The Apostle sometimes calls Jesus Christ the second Adam, and compares Him to the first Adam; for as in the
first all men die, so in the second all are made alive: and as in the natural order Adam was the father of the
human race, so in the supernatural order Christ is The author of grace and of glory.

The Virgin Mother we may also compare to Eve, making the second Eve, that is, Mary, correspond to the first,
as we have already shown that the second Adam, that is, Christ, corresponds to the first Adam. By believing the
serpent, Eve brought malediction and death on mankind, and Mary, by believing the Angel, became the
instrument of The divine goodness in bringing life and benediction to the human race. From Eve we are born
children of wrath; from Mary we have received Jesus Christ, and through Him are regenerated children of
grace. To Eve it was said: In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children. Mary was exempt from this law, for
preserving her virginal integrity inviolate she brought forth Jesus the Son of God without experiencing, as we
have already said, any sense of pain.




Types and Prophecies of the Conception and Nativity

The mysteries of this admirable Conception and Nativity being, therefore, so great and so numerous, it accorded
with the plan of divine Providence to signify them by many types and prophecies. Hence the holy Fathers



                                                        50
understood many things which we meet in the Sacred Scriptures to refer to these mysteries, particularly that
gate of the sanctuary which Ezechiel saw closed; the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, which
became a great mountain and filled the universe, of which we read in Daniel; the rod of Aaron, which alone
budded of all the rods of the princes of Israel; and the bush which Moses saw burr without being consumed.'

The holy Evangelist describes in detail the history of the birth of Christ; but, as the pastor can easily recur to the
Sacred Volume, it is unnecessary for us to say more on the subject.




Lessons which this Article Teaches

The pastor should labor to impress deeply on the minds and hearts of the faithful these mysteries, which were
written for our learning; first, that by the commemoration of so great a benefit they may make some return of
gratitude to God, its author, and next, in order to place before their eyes, as a model for imitation, this striking
and singular example of humility.




Humility And Poverty Of Christ

What can be more useful, what better calculated to subdue the pride and haughtiness of the human heart, than to
reflect frequently that God humbles Himself in such a manner as to assume our frailty and weakness, in order to
communicate to us His glory; that God becomes man, and that He at whose nod, to use the words of Scripture,
the pillars of heaven tremble and are affrighted bows His supreme and infinite majesty to minister to man; that
He whom the Angels adore in heaven is born on earth ! When such is the goodness of God towards us, what, I
ask, should we not do to testify our obedience to His will? With what willingness and alacrity should we not
love, embrace, and perform all the duties of humility ?

The faithful should also consider the salutary lessons which Christ at His birth teaches before He begins to
speak. He is born in poverty; He is born a stranger under a roof not His own; He is born in a lonely crib; He is
born in the depth of winter ! For St. Luke writes as follows: And it came to pass, that when they were there, her
days were accomplished, that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first-born, and wrapped him
up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. Could the
Evangelist have described under more humble terms the majesty and glory that filled the heavens and the earth
? He does not say, there was no room in the inn, but there was no room for him who says, the world is mine,
and the fullness thereof. As another Evangelist has expressed it: He came unto his own, and his own received
him not.




Elevation And Dignity Of Man

When the faithful have placed these things before their eyes, let them also reflect that God condescended to
assume the lowliness and frailty of our flesh in order to exalt man to the highest degree of dignity. This single
reflection, that He who is true and perfect God became man, supplies sufficient proof of the exalted dignity
conferred on the human race by the divine bounty; since we may now glory that the Son of God is bone of our
bone, and flesh of our flesh, a privilege not given to Angels, for nowhere, says the Apostle, doth he take hold of
the Angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.




Duty Of Spiritual Nativity



                                                         51
We must also take care lest to our great injury it should happen that just as there was no room for Him in the inn
at Bethlehem, in which to be born, so likewise now, after He has been born in the flesh, He should find no room
in our hearts in which to be born spiritually. For since He is most desirous of our salvation, this spiritual birth is
the object of His most earnest solicitude.

As, then, by the power of the Holy Ghost, and in a manner superior to the order of nature, He was made man
and was born, was holy and even holiness itself, so does it become our duty to be born, not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, but of God; to walk as new creatures in newness of spirit, and to preserve that holiness and
purity of soul which so much becomes men regenerated by the Spirit of God. Thus shall we reflect some faint
image of the holy Conception and Nativity of the Son of God, which are the objects of our firm faith, and
believing which we revere and adore the wisdom of God in a mystery which is hidden.




              ARTICLE IV : "Suffered Under Pontius Pilate, Was Crucified, Dead, And Buried'"




Importance Of This Article

How necessary is a knowledge of this Article, and how assiduous the pastor should be in stirring up in the
minds of the faithful the frequent recollection of our Lord's Passion" we learn from the Apostle when he says
that he knows nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified.' The pastor, therefore, should exercise the greatest
care and pains in giving a thorough explanation of this subject" in order that the faithful" being moved by the
remembrance of so great a benefit" may give themselves entirely to the contemplation of the goodness and love
of God towards us.




First Part of this Article: '"Suffered Under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified”,

The first part of this Article (of the second we shall treat hereafter) proposes for our belief that when Pontius
Pilate governed the province of Judea" under Tiberius Caesar" Christ the Lord was nailed to a cross. Having
been seized" mocked, outraged and tortured in various forms" He was finally crucified.




"Suffered,"

It cannot be a matter of doubt that His soul" as to its inferior part" was sensible of these torments; for as He
really assumed human nature" it is a necessary consequence that He really, and in His soul, experienced a most
acute sense of pain. Hence these words of the Saviour: My soul is sorrowful even unto death.

Although human nature was united to the Divine Person, He felt the bitterness of His Passion as acutely as if no
such union had existed" because in the one Person of Jesus Christ were preserved the properties of both natures"
human and divine; and therefore what was passible and mortal remained passible and mortal; while what was
impassible and immortal, that is, His Divine Nature, continued impassible and immortal.




"Under Pontius Pilate"




                                                         52
Since we find it here so diligently recorded that Jesus Christ suffered when Pontius Pilate was procurator of
Judea, the pastor should explain the reason. By fixing the time, which we find also done by the Apostle Paul, so
important and so necessary an event is rendered more easily ascertainable by all. Furthermore those words show
that the Saviour's prediction was really verified: They shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to be mocked and
scourged and crucified.




"Was Crucified"

The fact that He suffered death precisely on the wood of the cross must also be attributed to a particular counsel
of God, which decreed that life should return by the way whence death had arisen The serpent who had
triumphed over our first parents by the wood (of a tree) was vanquished by Christ on the wood of the cross.

Many other reasons which the Fathers have discussed in detail might be adduced to show that it was fit that our
Redeemer should suffer death on the cross rather than in any other way. But, as the pastor will show" it is
enough for the faithful to believe that this kind of death was chosen by the Saviour because it appeared better
adapted and more appropriate to the redemption of the human race; for there certainly could be none more
ignominious and humiliating. Not only among the Gentiles was the punishment of the cross held accursed and
full of shame and infamy, but even in the Law of Moses the man is called accursed that hangeth on a tree.




Importance Of The History Of The Passion

Furthermore, the pastor should not omit the historical part of this Article, which has been so carefully set forth
by the holy Evangelists; so that the faithful may be acquainted with at least the principal points of this mystery,
that is to say, such as seem more necessary to confirm the truth of our faith. For it is on this Article, as on their
foundation, that the Christian faith and religion rest; and if this truth be firmly established, all the rest is secure.
Indeed, if one thing more than another presents difficulty to the mind and understanding of man, assuredly it is
the mystery of the cross, which, beyond all doubt, must be considered the most difficult of all; so much so that
only with great difficulty can we grasp the fact that our salvation depends on the cross, and on Him who for us
was nailed thereon. In this, however, as the Apostle teaches, we may well admire the wonderful Providence of
God; for, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the
foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe. It is no wonder, then, that the Prophets, before the coming
of Christ, and the Apostles, after His death and Resurrection, labored so strenuously to convince mankind that
He was the Redeemer of the world, and to bring them under the power and obedience of the Crucified.




Figures And Prophecies Of The Passion And Death Of The Saviour

Since, therefore, nothing is so far above the reach of human reason as the mystery of the cross, the Lord
immediately after the fall ceased not, both by figures and prophecies, to signify the death by which His Son was
to die.

To mention a few of these types. First of all, Abel, who fell a victim of the envy of his brother, Isaac who was
commanded to be offered in sacrifice, the lamb immolated by the Jews on their departure from Egypt, and also
the brazen serpent lifted up by Moses in the desert, were all figures of the Passion and death of Christ the Lord.

As to the Prophets, how many there were who foretold Christ's Passion and death is too well known to require
development here. Not to speak of David, whose Psalms embrace all the principal mysteries of Redemption, the




                                                           53
oracles of Isaias in particular are so clear and graphic that he might be said rather to have recorded a past than
predicted a future event. a




Second Part Of This Article: "Dead, And Buried"




Christ Really Died

The pastor should explain that these words present for our belief that Jesus Christ, after He was crucified, really
died and was buried. It is not without just reason that this is proposed to the faithful as a separate object of
belief, since there were some who denied His death upon the cross. The Apostles, therefore, were justly of
opinion that to such an error should be opposed the doctrine of faith contained in this Article, the truth of which
is placed beyond the possibility of doubt by the united testimony of all the Evangelists, who record that Jesus
yielded up the ghost.

Moreover as Christ was true and perfect man, He of course was capable of dying. Now man dies when the soul
is separated from the body. When, therefore, we say that Jesus died, we mean that His soul was disunited from
His body. We do not admit, however, that the Divinity was separated from His body. On the contrary, we firmly
believe and profess that when His soul was dissociated from His body, His Divinity continued always united
both to His body in the sepulchre and to His soul in limbo. It became the Son of God to die, that, through death,
he might destroy him who had the empire of death that is the devil, and might deliver them, who through the
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.




Christ Died Freely

It was the peculiar privilege of Christ the Lord to have died when He Himself decreed to die, and to have died
not so much by external violence as by internal assent. Not only His death, but also its time and place, were
ordained by Him. For thus Isaias wrote: He was offered because it was his own will. The Lord before His
Passion, declared the same of Himself: I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No man taketh it away from
me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it again. As to the
time and place of His death, He said, when Herod insidiously sought His life: Go and tell that fox: Behold I cast
out devils, and do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am consummated. Nevertheless I must walk
today and to-morrow, and the day following, because it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.'' He
therefore offered Himself not involuntarily or by compulsion but of His own free will. Going to meet His
enemies He said: I am he; and all the punishments which injustice and cruelty inflicted on Him He endured
voluntarily.




The Thought Of Christ's Death Should Excite Our Love And Gratitude

When we meditate on the sufferings and all the torments of the Redeemer, nothing is better calculated to stir our
souls than the thought that He endured them thus voluntarily. Were anyone to endure all kinds of suffering for
our sake, not because he chose them but simply because he could not escape them, we should not consider this a
very great favour; but were he to endure death freely, and for our sake only, having had it in his power to avoid
it, this indeed would be a benefit so overwhelming as to deprive even the most grateful heart, not only of the
power of returning but even of feeling due thanks. We may hence form an idea of the transcendent and intense
love of Jesus Christ towards us, and of His divine and boundless claims to our gratitude.



                                                        54
Christ Was Really Buried

When we confess that He was buried, we do not make this, as it were, a distinct part of the Article, as if it
presented any new difficulty which is not implied in what we have said of His death; for if we believe that
Christ died, we can also easily believe that He was buried. The word buried was added in the Creed, first, that
His death might be rendered more certain, for the strongest argument of a person's death is the proof that his
body was buried; and, secondly, to render the miracle of His Resurrection more authentic and illustrious.

It is not, however, our belief that the body of Christ alone was interred. The above words propose, as the
principal object of our belief, that God was buried; as according to the rule of Catholic faith we also say with
the strictest truth that God died, and that God was born of a virgin. For as the Divinity was never separated from
His body which was laid in the sepulchre, we truly confess that God was buried.




Circumstances Of Christ’s Burial

As to the manner and place of His burial, what the holy Evangelists record on these subjects will be sufficient
for the pastor. There are, however, two things which demand particular attention; the one, that the body of
Christ was in no degree corrupted in the sepulchre, according to the prediction of the Prophet: Thou wilt not
give thy holy one to see corruption; the other, and it regards the several parts of this Article, that burial, Passion,
and also death, apply to Christ Jesus not as God but as man. To suffer and die are incidental to human nature
only; yet they are also attributed to God, since, as is clear, they are predicated with propriety of that Person who
is at once perfect God and perfect man.




Useful Considerations on the Passion

When the faithful have once attained the knowledge of these things, the pastor should next proceed to explain
those particulars of the Passion and death of Christ which may enable them if not to comprehend, at least to
contemplate, the immensity of so stupendous a mystery.




The Dignity Of The Sufferer

And first we must consider who it is that suffers all these things. His dignity we cannot express in words or even
conceive in mind. Of Him St. John says, that He is the Word which was with God. And the Apostle describes
Him in sublime terms, saying that this is He -whom God hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the world, who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things
by the word of his power, making purgation of sins. sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high. In a word,
Jesus Christ, the God-man, suffers ! The Creator suffers for His creatures, the Master for His servant. He suffers
by whom the Angels, men, the heavens, and the elements were made; in whom, by whom, and of whom, are all
things.

It cannot, therefore, be a matter of surprise that while He agonised under such an accumulation of torments the
whole frame of the universe was convulsed; for as the Scriptures inform us, the earth quaked, and the rocks
were rent, there was darkness over all the earth; and the sun was obscured. If, then, even mute and inanimate
nature sympathised with the sufferings of her Creator, let the faithful consider with what tears they, the living
stones of this edifice, should manifest their sorrow.



                                                          55
Reasons Why Christ Suffered

The reasons why the Saviour suffered are also to be explained, that thus the greatness and intensity of the divine
love towards us may the more fully appear. Should anyone inquire why the Son of God underwent His most
bitter Passion, he will find that besides the guilt inherited from our first parents the principal causes were the
vice's and crimes which have been perpetrated from the beginning of the world to the present day and those
which will be committed to the end of time. In His Passion and death the Son of God, our Saviour, intended to
atone for and blot out the sins of all ages, to offer for them to his Father a full and abundant satisfaction.

Besides, to increase the dignity of this mystery, Christ not only suffered for sinners, but even for those who
were the very authors and ministers of all the torments He endured. Of this the Apostle reminds us in these
words addressed to the Hebrews: Think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against
himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds. In this guilt are involved all those who fall frequently
into sin; for, as our sins consigned Christ the Lord to the death of the cross, most certainly those who wallow in
sin and iniquity crucify to themselves again the Son of God, as far as in them lies, and make a mockery of Him.
This guilt seems more enormous in us than in the Jews, since according to the testimony of the same Apostle: If
they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory; while we, on the contrary, professing to
know Him, yet denying Him by our actions, seem in some sort to lay violent hands on him.




Christ Was Delivered Over To Death By The Father And By Himself

But that Christ the Lord was also delivered over to death by the Father and by Himself, the Scriptures bear
witness. For in Isaias (God the Father) says For the wickedness of my people have I struck him. And a little
before the same Prophet filled with the Spirit of God, cried out, as he saw the Lord covered with stripes and
wounds: All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside into his own way: and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all. But of the Son it is written: If he shall lay down his life for sin, he shall see a
long-lived seed. This the Apostle expresses in language still stronger when, in order to show how confidently
we, on our part, should trust in the boundless mercy and goodness of God, he says: He that spared not even his
own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things? a




The: Bitterness Of Christ's Passion

The next subject of the pastor's instruction is the bitterness of the Redeemer's Passion. If we bear m mind that
his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground, and this, at the sole anticipation of the
torments and agony which He was about to endure, we must at once perceive that His sorrows admitted of no
increase. For if the very idea of impending evils was overwhelming, and the sweat of blood shows that it was,
what are we to suppose their actual endurance to have been ?

That Christ our Lord suffered the most excruciating torments of mind and body is certain. In the first place,
there was no part of His body that did not experience the most agonising torture. His hands and feet were
fastened with nails to the cross; His head was pierced with thorns and smitten with a reed; His face was
befouled with spittle and buffeted with blows; His whole body was covered with stripes.

Furthermore men of all ranks and conditions were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
Gentiles and Jews were the advisers, the authors, the ministers of His Passion: Judas betrayed Him, Peter denied
Him, all the rest deserted Him.




                                                          56
And while He hangs from the cross are we not at a loss which to deplore, His agony, or His ignominy, or both?
Surely no death more shameful, none more cruel, could have been devised than this. It was the punishment
usually reserved for the most guilty and atrocious malefactors, a death whose slowness aggravated the exquisite
pain and torture I

His agony was increased by the very constitution and frame of His body. Formed by the power of the Holy
Ghost, it was more perfect and better organised than the bodies of other men can be, and was therefore endowed
with a superior susceptibility and a keener sense of all the torments which it endured.

And as to His interior anguish of soul, that too was no doubt extreme; for those among the Saints who had to
endure torments and tortures were not without consolation from above, which enabled them not only to bear
their sufferings patiently, but in many instances, to feel, in the very midst of them, filled with interior joy. I
rejoice, says the Apostle, in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of
Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church;' and in another place: I am filled with comfort, I
exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulations. Christ our Lord tempered with no admixture of sweetness
the bitter chalice of His Passion but permitted His human nature to feel as acutely every species of torment as if
He were only man, and not also God.




Fruits Of Christ's Passion

It only remains now that the pastor carefully explain the blessings and advantages which flow from the Passion
of Christ. In the first place, then, the Passion of our Lord was our deliverance from sin; for, as St. John says, He
hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood. He hath quickened you together with him, says the
Apostle, forgiving you all offences, blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was
contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross.

In the next place He has rescued us from the tyranny of the devil, for our Lord Himself says: Now is the
judgment of the world; now shall the prance of this world be cast out. And I if I be lifted up from the earth, will
draw all things to myself.

Again He discharged the punishment due to our sins. And as no sacrifice more pleasing and acceptable could
have been offered to God, He reconciled us to the Father, appeased His wrath, and made Him favourable to us.

Finally, by taking away our sins He opened to us heaven, which was closed by the common sin of mankind.
And this the Apostle pointed out when he said: We have confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood
of Christ. Nor are we without a type and figure of this mystery in the Old Law. For those who were prohibited
to return into their native country before the death of the high-priest typified that no one, however just and holy
may have been his life, could gain admission into the celestial country until the eternal High-priest, Christ Jesus,
had died, and by His death immediately opened heaven to those who, purified by the Sacraments and gifted
with faith, hope, and charity, become partakers of His Passion.




Christ’s Passion, -- A Satisfaction, A Sacrifice, A Redemption An Example

The pastor should teach that all these inestimable and divine blessings flow to us from the Passion of Christ.
First, indeed, because the satisfaction which Jesus Christ has in an admirable manner made to God the Father
for our sins is full and complete. The price which He paid for our ransom was not only adequate and equal to
our debts, but far exceeded them.




                                                        57
Again, it (the Passion of Christ) was a sacrifice most acceptable to God, for when offered by His Son on the
altar of the cross, it entirely appeased the wrath and indignation of the Father. This word (sacrifice) the Apostle
uses when he says: Christ hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for
an odour of sweetness.

Furthermore, it was a redemption, of which the Prince of the Apostles says: You were not redeemed with
corruptible things as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers: but with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled. While the Apostle teaches: Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.

Besides these incomparable blessings, we have also received another of the highest importance; namely, that in
the Passion alone we have the most illustrious example of the exercise of every virtue. For He so displayed
patience, humility, exalted charity, meekness, obedience and unshaken firmness of soul, not only in suffering
for justice, sake, but also in meeting death, that we may truly say on the day of His Passion alone, our Saviour
offered, in His own Person, a living exemplification of all the moral precepts inculcated during the entire time
of His public ministry.




Admonition

This exposition of the saving Passion and death of Christ the Lord we have given briefly. Would to God that
these mysteries were always present to our minds, and that we learned to suffer, die, and be buried together with
our Lord; so that from henceforth, having cast aside all stain of sin, and rising with Him to newness of life, we
may at length, through His grace and mercy, be found worthy to be made partakers of the celestial kingdom and
glory !




  ARTICLE V : "HE DESCENDED INTO HELL, THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE
                                    DEAD"




Importance Of This Article

To know the glory of the burial of our Lord Jesus Christ, of which we last treated, is highly important; but of
still higher importance is it to the faithful to know the splendid triumphs which He obtained by having subdued
the devil and despoiled the abodes of hell. Of these triumphs, and also of His Resurrection, we are now about to
speak.

Although the latter presents to us a subject which might with propriety be treated under a separate and distinct
head, yet following the example of the holy Fathers, we have deemed it fitting to unite it with His descent into
hell.




First Part of this Article: "He Descended into Hell"

In the first part of this Article, then, we profess that immediately after the death of Christ His soul descended
into hell, and dwelt there as long as His body remained in the tomb; and also that the one Person of Christ was
at the same time in hell and in the sepulchre. Nor should this excite surprise; for, as we have already frequently




                                                        58
said, although His soul was separated from His body, His Divinity was never parted from either His soul or His
body.




"Hell"

As the pastor, by explaining the meaning of the word hell in this place may throw considerable light on the
exposition of this Article, it is to be observed that by the word hell is not here meant the sepulchre, as some
have not less impiously than ignorantly imagined; for in the preceding Article we learned that Christ the Lord
was buried, and there was no reason why the Apostles, in delivering an Article of faith, should repeat the same
thing in other and more obscure terms.

Hell, then, here signifies those secret abodes in which are detained the souls that have not obtained the
happiness of heaven. In this sense the word is frequently used in Scripture. Thus the Apostle says: At the name
of Jesus every knee shall bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and in hell; and in the Acts of the Apostles
St. Peter says that Christ the Lord is again risen, having loosed the sorrows of hell.




Different Abodes Called Hell"

These abodes are not all of the same nature, for among them is that most loathsome and dark prison in which
the souls of the damned are tormented with the unclean spirits in eternal and inextinguishable fire. This place is
called gehenna, the bottomless pit, and is hell strictly so-called.

Among them is also the fire of purgatory, in which the souls of just men are cleansed by a temporary
punishment, in order to be admitted into their eternal country, into which nothing defiled entereth. The truth of
this doctrine, founded, as holy Councils declare,' on Scripture, and confirmed by Apostolic tradition, demands
exposition from the pastor, all the more diligent and frequent, because we live in times when men endure not
sound doctrine.

Lastly, the third kind of abode is that into which the souls of the just before the coming of Christ the Lord, were
received, and where, without experiencing any sort of pain, but supported by the blessed hope of redemption,
they enjoyed peaceful repose. To liberate these holy souls, who, in the bosom of Abraham were expecting the
Saviour, Christ the Lord descended into hell.




"He Descended"

We are not to imagine that His power and virtue only, and not also His soul, descended into hell; but we are
firmly to believe that His soul itself, really and substantially, descended thither, according to this conclusive
testimony of David: Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.

But although Christ descended into hell, His supreme power was in no degree lessened, nor was the splendour
of His sanctity obscured by any blemish. His descent served rather to prove that whatever had been foretold of
His sanctity was true; and that, as He had previously demonstrated by so many miracles, He was truly the Son
of God.

This we shall easily understand by comparing the causes of the descent of Christ with those of other men. They
descended as captives; He as free and victorious among the dead, to subdue those demons by whom, in
consequence of guilt, they were held in captivity. Furthermore all others descended, either to endure the most


                                                         59
acute torments, or, if exempt from other pain, to be deprived of the vision of God, and to be tortured by the
delay of the glory and happiness for which they yearned; Christ the Lord descended, on the contrary, not to
suffer, but to liberate the holy and the just from their painful captivity, and to impart to them the fruit of His
Passion. His supreme dignity and power, therefore, suffered no diminution by His descent into hell.




Why He Descended into Hell




To Liberate The Just

Having explained these things, the pastor should next proceed to teach that Christ the Lord descended into hell,
in order that having despoiled the demons, He might liberate from prison those holy Fathers and the other just
souls, and might bring them into heaven with Himself. This He accomplished in an admirable and most glorious
manner; for His august presence at once shed a celestial lustre upon the captives and filled them with
inconceivable joy and delight. He also imparted to them that supreme happiness which consists in the vision of
God, thus verifying His promise to the thief on the cross: This day thou shalt be with me in paradise.

This deliverance of the just was long before predicted by Osee in these words: O death, I will be thy death; O
hell, I will be thy bite; ' and also by the Prophet Zachary: Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth
thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water; and lastly, the same is expressed by the Apostle in these words:
Despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing over them
in himself.

But the better to understand the efficacy of this mystery we should frequently call to mind that not only the just
who were born after the coming of our Lord, but also those who preceded Him from the days of Adam, or who
shall be born until the end of time, obtain their salvation through the benefit of His Passion. Wherefore before
His death and Resurrection heaven was closed against every child of Adam. The souls of the just, on their
departure from this life, were either borne to the bosom of Abraham; or, as is still the case with those who have
something to be washed away or satisfied for, were purified in the fire of purgatory.




To Proclaim His Power

Another reason why Christ the Lord descended into hell is that there, as well as in heaven and on earth, He
might proclaim His power and authority, and that every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth,
and under the earth.

And here, who is not filled with admiration and astonishment when he contemplates the infinite love of God for
man! Not satisfied with having undergone for our sake a most cruel death, He penetrates the inmost recesses of
the earth to transport into bliss the souls whom He so dearly loved and whose liberation from thence He had
achieved.




Second Part of this Article: "The Third Day He arose again from the Dead"

We now come to the second part of the Article, and how indefatigable should be the labours of the pastor in its
exposition we learn from these words of the Apostle: Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from
the dead. This command no doubt was addressed not only to Timothy, but to all others who have care of souls.


                                                         60
The meaning of the Article is this: Christ the Lord expired on the cross, on Friday at the ninth hour, and was
buried on the evening of the same day by His disciples, who with the permission of the governor, Pilate, laid the
body of the Lord, taken down from the cross, in a new tomb, situated in a garden near at hand. Early on the
morning of the third day after His death, that is, on Sunday, His soul was reunited to His body, and thus He who
was dead during those three days arose, and returned again to life, from which He had departed when dying.




"He arose Again"

By the word Resurrection, however, we are not merely to understand that Christ was raised from the dead,
which happened to many others, but that He rose by His own power and virtue, a singular prerogative peculiar
to Him alone. For it is incompatible with nature and was never given to man to raise himself by his own power,
from death to life. This was reserved for the almighty power of God, as we learn from these words of the
Apostle: Although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. This divine power,
having never been separated, either from His body in the grave, or from His soul in hell, there existed a divine
force both within the body, by which it could be again united to the soul, and within the soul, by which it could
again return to the body. Thus He was able by His own power to return to life and rise from the dead.

This David, filled with the spirit of God, foretold in these words: His right hand hath wrought for him salvation,
and his arm is holy. Our Lord confirmed this by the divine testimony of His own mouth when He said: I lay
down my life that I may take it again . . . and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again.
To the Jews He also said, in corroboration of His doctrine: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up. Although the Jews understood Him to have spoken thus of that magnificent Temple built of stone, yet as the
Scripture testifies in the same place, he spoke of the temple of his body. We sometimes, it is true, read in
Scripture that He was raised by the Father; but this refers to Him as man, just as those passages on the other
hand, which say that He rose by His own power relate to Him as God.




"From the Dead"

It is also the peculiar privilege of Christ to have been the first who enjoyed this divine prerogative of rising from
the dead, for He is called in Scripture the first-begotten from the dead, and also the first-born of the dead. The
Apostle also says: Christ is risen from the dead, the first-fruits of them that sleep: for by a man came death, and
by a man the resurrection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive. But
every one in his own order: the first-fruits Christ, then they that are of Christ.

These words of the Apostle are to be understood of a perfect resurrection, by which we are raised to an
immortal life and are no longer subject to the necessity of dying. In this resurrection Christ the Lord holds the
first place; for if we speak of resurrection; that is, of a return to life, subject to the necessity of again dying,
many were thus raised from the dead before Christ, all of whom, however, were restored to life to die again. But
Christ the Lord, having subdued and conquered death, so arose that He could die no morel according to' this
most clear testimony: Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion
over him.




"The Third Day"

In explanation of the additional words of the Article, the third day, the pastor should inform the people that they
must not think our Lord remained in the grave during the whole of these three days. But as He lay in the




                                                         61
sepulchre one full day, a part of the preceding and a part of the following day, He is said, with strictest truth, to
have lain in the grave for three days, and on the third day to have risen again from the dead.

To prove that He was God He did not delay His Resurrection to the end of the world; while, on the other hand,
to convince us that He was truly man and really died, He rose not immediately, but on the third day after His
death, a space of time sufficient to prove the reality of His death.




"According to the Scriptures"

Here the Fathers of the first Council of Constantinople added the words, according to the Scriptures, which they
took from St. Paul. These words they embodied with the Creed, because the same Apostle teaches the absolute
necessity of the mystery of the Resurrection when he says: If Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching
vain, and your faith is also vain . . . for you are yet in your sins. Hence,, admiring our belief of this Article St.
Augustine says: It is no great thing to believe that Christ died. This the pagans, Jews, and all the wicked believe;
in a word, all believe that Christ died. But that He rose from the dead is the belief of the Christians. To believe
that He rose again, this we deem of great moment.

Hence it is that our Lord very frequently spoke to His disciples of His Resurrection, and seldom or never of His
Passion without adverting to His Resurrection. Thus, when He said: The son of man . . . shall be delivered to the
Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon; and after they have scourged him, they will put him
to death; He added: and the third day he shall rise again.' Also when the Jews called upon Him to give an
attestation of the truth of His doctrine by some miraculous sign He said: A sign shall not be given to them, but
the sign of Jonas the prophet. For as Jonas was in the whales belly three days and three nights: so shall the son
of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.




Three Useful Considerations on this Article

To understand still better the force and meaning of this Article, there are three things which we must consider
and understand: first, why the Resurrection was necessary; secondly, its end and object; thirdly, the blessings
and advantages of which it is to us the source.




Necessity Of The Resurrection

With regard to the first, it was necessary that Christ should rise again in order to manifest the justice of God; for
it was most congruous that He who through obedience to God was degraded, and loaded with ignominy, should
by Him be exalted. This is a reason assigned by the Apostle when he says to the Philippians: He humbled
himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. For which cause God also hath exalted
him. He rose also to confirm our faith, which is necessary for justification; for the Resurrection of Christ from
the dead by His own power affords an irrefragable proof that He was the Son of God. Again the Resurrection
nourishes and sustains our hope. As Christ rose again, we rest on an assured hope that we too shall rise again;
the members must necessarily arrive at the condition of their head. This is the conclusion which St. Paul seems
to draw when he writes to the Corinthians and to the Thessalonians.' And Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, says:
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us
unto a lively nope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto the inheritance incorruptible.

Finally, the Resurrection of our Lord, as the pastor should inculcate, was necessary to complete the mystery of
our salvation and redemption. By His death Christ liberated us from sin; by His Resurrection, He restored to us



                                                         62
the most important of those privileges which we had forfeited by sin. Hence these words of the Apostle: He was
delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification. That nothing, therefore, may be wanting to the
work of our salvation, it was necessary that as He died, He should also rise again.'




Ends Of The Resurrection

From what has been said we can perceive what important advantages the Resurrection of Christ the Lord has
conferred on the faithful. In the Resurrection we acknowledge God to be immortal, full of glory, the conqueror
of death and the devil; and all this we are firmly to believe and openly to profess of Christ Jesus.

Again, the Resurrection of Christ effects for us the resurrection of our bodies not only because it was the
efficient cause of this mystery, but also because we all ought to arise after the example of the Lord. For with
regard to the resurrection of the body we have this testimony of the Apostle: By a man came death, and by a
man the resurrection of the dead. In all that God did to accomplish the mystery of our redemption He made use
of the humanity of Christ as an effective instrument, and hence His Resurrection was, as it were, an instrument
for the accomplishment of our resurrection.

It may also be called the model of ours, inasmuch as His Resurrection was the most perfect of all. And as His
body, rising to immortal glory, was changed, so shall our bodies also, before frail and mortal, be restored and
clothed with glory and immortality. In the language of the Apostle: We look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus
Christ, who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory.

The same may be said of a soul dead in sin. How the Resurrection of Christ is proposed to such a soul as the
model of her resurrection the same Apostle shows in these words: As Christ is risen from the dead by the glory
of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Again a little further on he says: Knowing that Christ
rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him. For in that he died
to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God: so do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but
alive unto God, in Christ Jesus.




Advantages Of The: Resurrection

From the Resurrection of Christ, therefore, we should draw two lessons: the one, that after we have washed
away the stains of sin, we should begin to lead a new life, distinguished by integrity, innocence, holiness,
modesty, justice, beneficence and humility; the other, that we should so persevere in that newness of life as
never more, with the divine assistance, to stray from the paths of virtue on which we have once entered.

Nor do the words of the Apostle prove only that the Resurrection of Christ is proposed as the model of our
resurrection; they also declare that it gives us power to rise again, and imparts to us strength and courage to
persevere in holiness and righteousness, and in the observance of the Commandments of God. For as His death
not only furnishes us with an example, but also supplies us with strength to die to sin, so also His Resurrection
invigorates us to attain righteousness, so that thenceforward serving God in piety and holiness, we may walk in
the newness of life to which we have risen. By His Resurrection, our Lord accomplished this especially that we,
who before died with Him to sin and to the world, should rise also with Him to a new order and manner of life.




Signs Of Spiritual Resurrection




                                                         63
The principal signs of this resurrection from sin which should be noted are taught us by the Apostle. For when
he says: If you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of
God, he distinctly tells us that they who desire to possess life, honour, repose and riches, there chiefly where
Christ dwells, have truly risen with Christ.

When he adds: Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth, he gives, as it were,
another sign by which we may ascertain if we have truly risen with Christ. As a relish for food usually indicates
a healthy state of the body, so with regard to the soul, if a person relishes whatever things are true, whatever
modest, whatever just, whatever holy, and experiences within him the sweetness of heavenly things, this we
may consider a very strong proof that such a one has risen with Christ Jesus to a new and spiritual life.




 ARTICLE VI : "HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN, SITTETH AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD THE
                              FATHER ALMIGHTY"




Importance Of This Article

Filled with the Spirit of God, and contemplating the blessed and glorious Ascension of our Lord, the Prophet
David exhorts all to celebrate that splendid triumph with the greatest joy and gladness: Clap your hands, all ye
nations: shout unto God with he voice of joy.... God is ascended with jubilee.

The pastor will hence learn that this mystery should be explained with the greatest diligence; and that he should
take care that the people not only perceive it with faith and understanding, but that they also strive as far as
possible, with the Lord's help to reflect it in their lives and actions.




First Part of this Article: "He Ascended into Heaven"

With regard, then, to the exposition of this sixth Article, which has reference principally to this divine mystery,
we shall begin with its first part, and point out its force and meaning.




"Into Heaven"

This, then, the faithful must believe without hesitation, that Jesus Christ, having fully accomplished the work of
Redemption, ascended as man, body and soul, into heaven; for as God He never forsook heaven, filling as He
does all places with His Divinity.




"He Ascended"

The pastor is also to teach that He ascended by His own power, not being taken up by the power of another, as
was Elias, who was carried to heaven in a fiery chariot; or, as the Prophet Habacuc, or Philip, the deacon, who
were borne through the air by the divine power, and traversed great distances.




                                                        64
Neither did He ascend into heaven solely by the exercise of His supreme power as God, but also by virtue of the
power which He possessed as man. Although human power alone was insufficient to accomplish this, yet the
virtue with which the blessed soul of Christ was endowed was capable of moving the body as it pleased, and
His body, now glorified, readily obeyed the behest of the soul that moved it. Hence, we believe that Christ
ascended into heaven as God and man by His own power.




Second Part of this Article: "Sitteth at the Right Hand of God the Father Almighty"

The words He sitteth at the right hand of the Father form the second part of this Article. In these words we
observe a figure of speech; that is, a use of words in other than their literal sense, as frequently happens in
Scripture, when, accommodating its language to human ideas, it attributes human affections and human
members to God, who, spirit as He is, admits of nothing corporeal.




"At the Right Hand"

As among men he who sits at the right hand is considered to occupy the most honourable place, so, transferring
the same idea to celestial things, to express the glory which Christ as man has obtained above all others, we
confess that He sits at the right hand of the Father.




"Sitteth"

To sit does not imply here position and posture of body, but expresses the firm and permanent possession of
royal and supreme power and glory which He received from the Father, and of which the Apostle says: Raising
him up from the dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places, above all principality, and
power, and virtue, and domination, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which
is to come; and he hath subjected all things under his feet. These words manifestly imply that this glory belongs
to our Lord in so special and exclusive a manner that it cannot apply to any other created being. Hence in
another place the Apostle testifies: To which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand.




Reflections on the Ascension:




Its History

The pastor should explain the sense of the Article more at length by detailing the history of the Ascension, of
which the Evangelist St. Luke has left us an orderly description in the Acts of the Apostles.




Greatness Of This Mystery




                                                         65
In this exposition he should observe, in the first place, that all other mysteries refer to the Ascension as to their
end and find in it their perfection and completion; for as all the mysteries of religion commence with the
Incarnation of our Lord, so His sojourn on earth terminates with His Ascension.

Moreover the other Articles of the Creed which regard Christ the Lord show His great humility and lowliness.
Nothing can be conceived more humble, nothing more lowly, than that the Son of God assumed our weak
human nature, and suffered and died for us. But nothing more magnificently, nothing more admirably,
proclaims His sovereign glory and divine majesty than what is contained in the present and in the preceding
Article, in which we declare that He rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God
the Father.




Reasons Of The Ascension

When the pastor has explained these truths, he should next accurately show why Christ the Lord ascended into
heaven.

First of all, He ascended because the glorious kingdom of the highest heavens, not the obscure abode of this
earth, presented a suitable dwelling place for Him whose body, rising from the tomb, was clothed with the glory
of immortality.

He ascended, however, not only to possess the throne of glory and the kingdom which He had merited by His
blood, but also to attend to whatever regards our salvation.

Again, He ascended to prove thereby that His kingdom is not of this world. For the kingdoms of this world are
earthly and transient, and are based upon wealth and the power of the flesh; but the kingdom of Christ is not, as
the Jews expected, earthly, but spiritual and eternal. Its resources and riches, too, are spiritual, as He showed by
placing His throne in the heavens, where they are counted richer and wealthier who seek most earnestly the
things that are of God, according to these words of St. James: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich
in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?

He also ascended into heaven in order to teach us to follow Him thither in mind and heart. For as by His death
and Resurrection He bequeathed to us an example of dying and rising again in spirit, so by His Ascension He
teaches and instructs us that though dwelling on earth, we should raise ourselves in desire to heaven, confessing
that we are pilgrims and strangers on the earth, seeking a country and that we are fellow-citizens with the saints,
and the domestics of God, for, says the same Apostle, our conversation is in heaven




Results Of The Ascension

The extent and greatness of the unutterable blessings which the bounty of God has showered on us were long
before, as the Apostle interprets, sung by the inspired David: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: He
gave gifts to men.' For on the tenth day He sent down the Holy Ghost, with whose power and plenitude He
filled the multitude of the faithful then present, and so fulfilled that splendid promise: It is expedient to you that
I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.

He also ascended into heaven, according to the Apostle, that he may appear in the presence of God f or us, and
discharge for us the office of advocate with the Father. My little children, says St. John, these things I write to
you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an. advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just: and
he is the propitiation for our sins. There is nothing from which the faithful should derive greater joy and




                                                         66
gladness of soul than from the reflection that Jesus Christ is constituted our advocate and the mediator of our
salvation with the Eternal Father, with whom His influence and authority are supreme.

Finally, by His Ascension He has prepared for us a place, as He had promised, and has entered, as our head, in
the name of us all, into the possession of the glory of heaven." Ascending into heaven, He threw open its gates,
which had been closed by the sin of Adam; and, as He foretold to His disciples at His Last Supper, secured to us
a way by which we may arrive at eternal happiness. In order to give an open proof of this by its fulfilment, He
introduced with Himself into the mansions of eternal bliss the souls of the just whom He had liberated from
hell.




Virtues Promoted By The Ascension.

A series of important advantages followed in the train of this admirable profusion of celestial gifts. In the first
place, the merit of our faith was considerably augmented; because faith has for its object those things which fall
not under the senses, but are far raised above the reach of human reason and intelligence. If, therefore, the Lord
had not departed from us, the merit of our faith would not be the same; for Christ the Lord has said: Blessed are
they that have not seen, and have believed

In the next place, the Ascension of Christ into heaven contributes much to confirm our hope. Believing that
Christ, as man, ascended into heaven, and placed our nature at the right hand of God the Father, we are
animated with a strong hope that we, as members, shall also ascend thither, to be there united to our Head,
according to these words of our Lord Himself: Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given
me may be with me

Another most important advantage is that He has taken our affections to heaven and inflamed them with the
Spirit of God; for most truly has it been said that where our treasure is, there also is our heart. And, indeed, were
Christ the Lord still dwelling on earth, the contemplation of His human nature and His company would absorb
all our thoughts, and we should view the author of such blessings only as man, and cherish towards Him a sort
of earthly affection. But by His Ascension into heaven He has spiritualised our affection and has made us
venerate and love as God Him whom, on account of His absence, we see only in thought. This we learn in part
from the example of the Apostles, who while our Lord was personally present with them, seemed to judge of
Him in some measure in a human light; and in part from these words of our Lord Himself: It is expedient to you
that I go. The imperfect affection with which they loved Christ Jesus when present had to be perfected by divine
love, and that by the coming of the Holy Ghost; and therefore He immediately subjoins: If I go not, the
Paraclete will not come to you.




The Ascension Benefits The Church And The Individual

Besides, He thus enlarged His household on earth, that is, His Church, which was to be governed by the power
and guidance of the Holy Spirit. He left Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, as its chief pastor and supreme head
upon earth; moreover he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some
pastors and doctors. Thus seated at the right hand of the Father He continually bestows different gifts on
different men; for as the Apostle testifies: To every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the
giving of Christ.

Finally, what we have already taught of the mystery of His death and Resurrection the faithful should deem not
less true of His Ascension. For although we owe our Redemption and salvation to the Passion of Christ, whose
merits opened heaven to the just, yet His Ascension is not only proposed to us as a model, which teaches us to
look on high and ascend in spirit into heaven, but it also imparts to us a divine virtue which enables us to
accomplish what it teaches.

  ARTICLE VII : "FROM THENCE HE SHALL COME TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD"




Meaning Of This Article

For the glory and adornment of His Church Jesus Christ is invested with three eminent offices and functions:
those of Redeemer, Mediator, and Judge. Since in the preceding Articles it was shown that the human race was
redeemed by His Passion and death, and since by His Ascension into heaven it is manifest that He has
undertaken the perpetual advocacy and patronage of our cause, it remains that in this Article we set forth His
character as Judge. The scope and intent of the Article is to declare that on the last day Christ the Lord will
judge the whole human race.




"From Thence He Shall Come"

The Sacred Scriptures inform us that there are two comings of the Son of God: the one when He assumed
human flesh for our salvation in the womb of a virgin; the other when He shall come at the end of the world to
judge all mankind. This latter coming is called in Scripture the day of the Lord. The day of the Lord, says the
Apostle, shall come, as a thief in the night; and our Lord Himself says: Of that day and hour no one knoweth.




"To Judge the Living and the Dead"

In proof of the (last) judgment it is enough to adduce the authority of the Apostle: We must all appear before the
judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done,
whether it be good or evil. There are numerous passages of Sacred Scripture which the pastor will find in
various places and which not only establish the truth of the dogma, but also place it in vivid colours before the
eyes of the faithful. And if, from the beginning of the world that day of the Lord, on which He was clothed with
our flesh, was sighed for by all as the foundation of their hope of deliverance; so also, after the death and
Ascension of the Son of God, we should make that other day of the Lord the object of our most earnest desires,
looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God.'




Two Judgments

In explaining this subject the pastor should distinguish two different occasions on which everyone must appear
in the presence of the Lord to render an account of all his thoughts, words and actions, and to receive immediate
sentence from his Judge.

The first takes place when each one of us departs this life; for then he is instantly placed before the judgment-
seat of God, where all that he has ever done or spoken or thought during life shall be subjected to the most rigid
scrutiny. This is called the particular judgment.

The second occurs when on the same day and in the same place all men shall stand together before the tribunal
of their Judge, that in the presence and hearing of all human beings of all times each may know his final doom
and sentence. The announcement of this judgment will constitute no small part of the pain and punishment of



                                                       68
the wicked; whereas the good and just will derive great reward and consolation from the fact that it will then
appear what each one was in life. This is called the general judgment.




Reasons For General Judgment

It is necessary to show why, besides the particular judgment of each individual, a general one should also be
passed upon all men.

Those who depart this life sometimes leave behind them children who imitate their conduct, dependents,
followers and others who admire and advocate their example, language and actions. Now by all these
circumstances the rewards or punishments of the dead must needs be increased, since the good or bad influence
of example, affecting as it does the conduct of many, is to terminate only with the end of the world. Justice
demands that in order to form a proper estimate of all these good or bad actions and words a thorough
investigation should be made. This, however, could not be without a general judgment of all men.

Moreover, as the character of the virtuous frequently suffers from misrepresentation, while that of the wicked
obtains the commendation of virtue, the justice of God demands that the former recover, in the public assembly
and judgment of all men, the good name of which they had been unjustly deprived before men.

Again, as the just and the wicked performed their good and evil actions in this life not without the cooperation
of the body, it necessarily follows that these actions belong also to the body as to their instrument. It was,
therefore, altogether suitable that the body should share with the soul the due rewards of eternal glory or
punishment. But this can only be accomplished by means of a general resurrection and of a general judgment.

Next, it is important to prove that in prosperity and adversity, which are sometimes the promiscuous lot of the
good and of the bad, everything is done and ordered by an all-wise and all-just Providence. It was, therefore,
necessary not only that rewards should await the just and punishments the wicked, in the life to come, but that
they should be awarded by a public and general judgment. Thus they will become better known and will be
rendered more conspicuous to all; and in atonement for the unwarranted murmurings, to which on seeing the
wicked abound in wealth and flourish in honours even the Saints themselves, as men, have sometimes given
expression, a tribute of praise will be offered by all to the justice and Providence of God. My feet, says the
Prophet, were almost moved, my steps had well nigh slipped, because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked,
seeing the prosperity of sinners; and a little after: Behold! these are sinners and yet abounding in the world, they
have obtained riches; and I said, Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the
innocent; and I have been scourged all the day, and my chastisement hath been in the morning. This has been
the frequent complaint of many, and a general judgment is therefore necessary, lest perhaps men may be
tempted to say that God walketh about the poles of heaven, and regards not the earth.




This Truth has Rightly been made an Article of the Creed

Wisely, therefore, has this truth been made one of the twelve Articles of the Christian Creed, so that should any
begin to waver in mind concerning the Providence and justice of God they might be reassured by this doctrine.

Besides, it was right that the just should be encouraged by the hope, the wicked appalled by the terror, of a
future judgment; so that knowing the justice of God the former should not be disheartened, while the latter
through fear and expectation of eternal punishment might be recalled from the paths of vice. Hence, speaking of
the last day, our Lord and Saviour declares that a general judgment will one day take place, and He describes
the signs of its approach, that seeing them, we may know that the end of the world is at hand. At His Ascension




                                                        69
also, to console His Apostles, overwhelmed with grief at His departure, He sent Angels, who said to them: This
Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into heaven




Circumstances of the Judgment:




The Judge

That the judgment of the world has been assigned to Christ the Lord, not only as God, but also as man, is
declared in Scripture. Although the power of judging is common to all the Persons of the Blessed Trinity, yet it
is specially attributed to the Son, because to Him also in a special manner is ascribed wisdom. But that as man,
He will judge the world, is taught by our Lord Himself when He says: As the Father hath life in himself, so he
hath given to the Son also, to have life in himself; and he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is
the son of man.

There is a peculiar propriety in Christ the Lord sitting in judgment; for sentence is to be pronounced on
mankind, and they are thus enabled to see their Judge with their eyes and hear Him with their ears, and so learn
their judgment through the medium of the senses.

Most just is it also that He who was most iniquitously condemned by the judgment of men should Himself be
afterwards seen by all men sitting in judgment on all. Hence when the Prince of the Apostles had expounded in
the house of Cornelius the chief dogmas of Christianity, and had taught that Christ was suspended from a cross
and put to death by the Jews and rose the third lay to life, he added: And he commanded us to preach to the
people, and to testify that this is he, who was appointed of God, to be the judge of the living and the dead.




Signs Of The General Judgment

The Sacred Scriptures inform us that the general judgment will be preceded by these three principal signs: the
preaching of the Gospel throughout the world, a falling away from the faith, and the coming of Antichrist. This
gospel of the kingdom, says our Lord, shall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all nations, and
then shall the consummation come. The Apostle also admonishes us that we be not seduced by anyone, as if the
day of the Lord were at hand; for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the judgement
will not come.




The Sentence Of The Just

The form and procedure of this judgment the pastor will easily learn from the prophecies of Daniel, the writings
of the Evangelists and the doctrine of the Apostle. The sentence to be pronounced by the judge is here deserving
of more than ordinary attention.

Looking with joyful countenance on the just standing on His right, Christ our Redeemer will pronounce
sentence on them with the greatest benignity, in these words: Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the
kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. That nothing can be conceived more delightful to
the ear than these words, we shall understand if we only compare them with the condemnation of the wicked;
and call to mind, that by them the just are invited from labor to rest, from the vale of tears to supreme joy, from
misery to eternal happiness, the reward of their works of charity.


                                                        70
The Sentence Of The Wicked

Turning next to those who shall stand on His left, He will pour out His justice upon them in these words: Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared f or the devil and his angels.

The first words, depart from me, express the heaviest punishment with which the wicked shall be visited, their
eternal banishment from the sight of God, unrelieved by one consolatory hope of ever recovering so great a
good. This punishment is called by theologians the pain of loss, because in hell the wicked shall be deprived
forever of the light of the vision of God.

The words ye cursed, which follow, increase unutterably their wretched and calamitous condition. If when
banished from the divine presence they were deemed worthy to receive some benediction, this would be to them
a great source of consolation. But since they can expect nothing of this kind as an alleviation of their misery, the
divine justice deservedly pursues them with every species of malediction, once they have been banished.

The next words, into everlasting fire, express another sort of punishment, which is called by theologians the
pain of sense, because, like lashes, stripes or other more severe chastisements, among which fire, no doubt,
produces the most intense pain, it is felt through the organs of sense. When, moreover, we reflect that this
torment is to be eternal, we can see at once that the punishment of the damned includes every kind of suffering.

The concluding words, which was prepared f or the devil and his angels, make this still more clear. For since
nature has so provided that we feel miseries less when we have companions and sharers in them who can, at
least in some measure, assist us by their advice and kindness, what must be the horrible state of the damned who
in such calamities can never separate themselves from the companionship of most wicked demons ? And yet
most justly shall this very sentence be pronounced by our Lord and Saviour on those sinners who neglected all
the works of true mercy, who gave neither food to the hungry, nor drink to the thirsty, who refused shelter to the
stranger and clothing to the naked, and who would not visit the sick and the imprisoned.




Importance of Instruction on this Article

These are thoughts which the pastor should very often bring to the attention of his people; for the truth which is
contained in this Article will, if accepted with faithful dispositions, be most powerful in bridling the evil
inclinations of the heart and in withdrawing men from sin. Hence we read in Ecclesiasticus: In all thy works
remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.' And indeed there is scarcely anyone so given over to vice as
not to be recalled to virtue by the thought that he must one day render an account before an all-just Judge, not
only of all his words and actions, but even of his most secret thoughts, and must suffer punishment according to
his deserts.

On the other hand, the just man will be more and more encouraged to lead a good life. Even though his days be
passed in poverty, ignominy and suffering, he must be gladdened exceedingly when he looks forward to that
day when, the conflicts of this wretched life being over, he shall be declared victorious in the hearing of all
men, and shall be admitted into his heavenly country to be crowned with divine honours that shall never fade.

It only remains, then, for the pastor to exhort the faithful to lead holy lives and practice every virtue, that thus
they may be enabled to look forward with confidence to the coming of that great day of the Lord -- nay, as
becomes children, even to desire it most fervently.

                          ARTICLE VIII : "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST"




Importance Of This Article

Hitherto we have expounded, as far as the nature of the subject seemed to require, what pertains to the First and
Second Per sons of the Holy Trinity. It now remains to explain what the Creed contains with regard to the Third
Person, the Holy Ghost.

On this subject the pastor should omit nothing that study and industry can effect; for on this Article, no less than
on those that preceded, ignorance or error would be unpardonable in a Christian. Hence, the Apostle did not
permit some among the Ephesians to remain in ignorance with regard to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Having
asked if they had received the Holy Ghost, and having received for answer that they did not so much as know
that there was a Holy, Ghost, he at once demanded: In whom, therefore, were you baptised? to signify that a
distinct knowledge of this Article is most necessary to the faithful.

From such knowledge they derive special fruit. For, considering attentively that whatever they have, they
possess through the bounty and beneficence of the Holy Spirit, they begin to think more modestly and humbly
of themselves, and to place all their hopes in the protection of God, which for a Christian is the first step
towards consummate wisdom and supreme happiness.




"Holy Ghost"

The exposition of this Article, therefore, should begin with the force and meaning here attached to the words
Holy Ghost. This appellation is equally true when applied to the Father and the Son, since both are spirit, both
holy, and we confess that God is a Spirit; this name may also be applied to Angels, and the souls of the just.
Care must be taken, therefore, that the faithful be not led into error by the ambiguity of the words.

The pastor, then, should teach that by the words Holy Ghost in this Article is understood the Third Person of the
Blessed Trinity, a sense in which they are used, sometimes in the Old, and frequently in the New Testament.
Thus David prays: Take not thy Holy Spirit from me; and in the Book of Wisdom we read: Who shall know thy
thoughts, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above? And in another place it is said: He
created her in the Holy Ghost.' We are also commanded, in the New Testament to be baptised in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. We read that the most holy Virgin conceived of the Holy Ghost;
and we are sent by St. John to Christ, who baptizeth us in the Holy Ghost.' There are many other passages in
which the words Holy Ghost occur.

No one should be surprised that a proper name is not given to the Third, as to the First and Second Persons. The
Second Person is designated by a proper name, and called Son, because, as has been explained in the preceding
Articles, His eternal birth from the Father is properly called generation. As, therefore, that birth is expressed by
the word generation, so the Person, emanating from that generation, is properly called Son, and the Person, from
whom he emanates, Father.

But as the production of the Third Person has no proper name, but is called spiration and procession, the Person
produced is, consequently, designated by no proper name. His emanation has no proper name simply because
we are obliged to borrow from created objects the names given to God and know no other created means of
communicating nature and essence than that of generation. Hence we cannot discover a proper name to express
the manner in which God communicates Himself entire, by the force of His love. Wherefore we call the Third
Person Holy Ghost, a name, however, peculiarly appropriate to Him who infuses into us spiritual life, and
without whose holy inspiration we can do nothing meritorious of eternal life.



                                                        72
"I Believe in the Holy Ghost"




The Holy Ghost Is Equal To The Father And The Son

The people, when once acquainted with the meaning of His name, should first of all be taught that the Holy
Ghost is equally God with the Father and the Son, equally omnipotent and eternal, infinitely perfect, the
supreme good, infinitely wise, and of the same nature as the Father and the Son.

All this is obviously enough implied by the force of the word in, when we say: I believe in the Holy Ghost; for
this preposition is prefixed to each Person of the Trinity in order to express the exact nature of our faith.

The Divinity of the Holy Ghost is also clearly established by many passages of Scripture. When, in the Acts of
the Apostles, St. Peter says, Ananias, Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? he immediately adds:
Thou hast not lied to men, but to God, calling Him God to whom he had just before given the name Holy Ghost.

The Apostle, also, writing to the Corinthians, interprets what he says of God as said of the Holy Ghost. There
are, he says, diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all; but, he continues, all these
things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.

In the Acts of the Apostles also what the Prophets attribute to God alone, St. Paul ascribes to the Holy. Ghost.
Thus Isaias had said: I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? . . . And he said: Go, and thou
shalt say to this people: Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears. Having cited these words, the Apostle adds: Well did the Holy
Ghost speak to our fathers, by Isaias the prophet.

Again, the Sacred Scriptures join the Person of the Holy Ghost to those of the Father and the Son, as, for
example, when Baptism is commanded to be administered in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. There is thus no room left us of doubting the truth of this mystery. For if the Father is God, and the
Son God, we must admit that the Holy Ghost, who is united with Them in the same degree of honour, is also
God.

Besides, baptism administered in the name of any creature can be of no effect. Were you baptised in the name
of Paul? says the Apostle, to show that such baptism could have availed nothing to salvation. Since, therefore,
we are baptised in the name of the Holy Ghost, we must acknowledge the Holy Ghost to be God.

This same order of the Three Persons, which proves the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, is also found in the Epistle
of St. John: There are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these
three are one; and also in that noble eulogy of the Holy Trinity, with which the Divine Praises and the Psalms
are concluded: Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.

Finally, what most strongly confirms this truth is the fact that Holy Scripture assigns to the Holy Ghost
whatever attributes we believe proper to God. Wherefore to Him is ascribed the honour of temples, as when the
Apostle says: Know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost? Scripture also attributes to
Him the power to sanctify, to vivify, to search the depths of God, to speak by the Prophets, and to be present in
all places, all of which can be attributed to God alone.




The Holy Ghost Is Distinct From The Father And The Son


                                                         73
The pastor should also accurately explain to the faithful that the Holy Ghost is not only God, but that we must
also confess that He is the Third Person of the Divine Nature, distinct from the Father and the Son, and
produced by Their will.

To say nothing of other testimonies of Scripture, the form of Baptism, taught by our Redeemer,' shows most
clearly that the Holy Ghost is the Third Person, self-existent in the Divine Nature and distinct from the other
Persons. It is a doctrine taught also by the Apostle when he says: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

This same truth is still more explicitly declared in these words added to this Article of the Creed by the Fathers
of the First Council of Constantinople to refute the impious folly of Macedonius: And in the Holy Ghost, the
Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son; who together with the Father and the Son,
is adored and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.




"The Lord"

By confessing the Holy Ghost to be Lord they declare how far He excels the Angels, who are the noblest spirits
created by God; for they are all, says the Apostle, ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive
the inheritance of salvation.




"Life-Giver"

They also designate the Holy Ghost the giver of life because the soul lives more by its union with God than the
body is nourished and sustained by its union with the soul. Since then, the Sacred Scriptures ascribe to the Holy
Ghost this union of the soul with God, it is clear that He is most rightly called the giver of life.




"Who Proceedeth from the Father and the Son"

With regard to the words immediately succeeding: who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, the faithful are
to be taught that the Holy Ghost proceeds by an eternal procession from the Father and the Son, as from one
principle. This truth is proposed for our belief by the Creed of the Church, from which no Christian may depart,
and is confirmed by the authority of the Sacred Scriptures and of Councils.

Christ the Lord, speaking of the Holy Ghost, says: He shall glorify me, because he shall receive of mine. We
also find that the Holy Ghost is sometimes called in Scripture the Spirit of Christ, sometimes, the Spirit of the
Father; that He is one time said to be sent by the Father, another time, by the Son, -- all of which clearly
signifies that He proceeds alike from the Father and the Son. He, says St. Paul, who has not the Spirit of Christ
belongs not to him. In his Epistle to the Galatians he also calls the Holy Ghost the Spirit of Christ: God hath
sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father. In the Gospel of St. Matthew, He is called the
Spirit of the Father: It is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.

Our Lord said, at His Last Supper: When the Paraclete cometh whom I will send you, the Spirit of truth, who
proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me. On another occasion, that the Holy Ghost will be
sent by the Father, He declares in these words: whom the Father will send in my name. Understanding these
words to denote the procession of the Holy Ghost, we come to the inevitable conclusion that He proceeds from
both Father and Son.




                                                        74
The above are the truths that should be taught with regard to the Person of the Holy Ghost.




Certain Divine Works are Appropriated to the Holy Ghost

It is also the duty of the pastor to teach that there are certain admirable effects, certain excellent gifts of the
Holy Ghost, which are said to originate and emanate from Him, as from a perennial fountain of goodness.
Although the intrinsic works of the most Holy Trinity are common to the Three Persons, yet many of them are
attributed specially to the Holy Ghost, to signify that they arise from the boundless charity of God towards us.
For as the Holy Ghost proceeds from the divine will, inflamed, as it were, with love, we can perceive that these
effects which are referred particularly to the Holy Ghost, are the result of God's supreme love for us.

Hence it is that the Holy Ghost is called a gift; for by the word gift we understand that which is kindly and
gratuitously bestowed, without expectation of any return. Whatever gifts and graces, therefore, have been
conferred on us by God -- and what have we, says the Apostle, that we have not received from God? -- we
should piously and gratefully acknowledge as bestowed by the grace and gift of the Holy Ghost.




Creation, Government, Life

These gifts of the Holy Ghost are numerous. Not to mention the creation of the world, the propagation and
government of all created beings, discussed in the first Article, we have just shown that the giving of life is
particularly attributed to the Holy Ghost, and this is further confirmed by the testimony of Ezechiel: I will give
you spirit and you shall live.




The Seven Gifts

The Prophet (Isaias), however, enumerates the chief effects which are most properly ascribed to the Holy Ghost:
The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and piety,
and the spirit of the fear of the Lord. These effects are called the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and sometimes they
are even called the Holy Ghost. Wisely, therefore, does St. Augustine admonish us, whenever we meet the word
Holy Ghost in Scripture, to distinguish whether it means the Third Person of the Trinity or His gifts and
operations.-' The two are as far apart as the Creator is from the creature.

The diligence of the pastor in expounding these truths should be the greater, since it is from these gifts of the
Holy Ghost that we derive rules of Christian life and are enabled to know if the Holy Ghost dwells within us.




Justifying Grace

But the grace of justification, which signs us with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the pledge of our
inheritance,' transcends all His other most ample gifts. It unites us to God in the closest bonds of love, lights up
within us the sacred flame of piety, forms us to newness of life, renders us partakers of the divine nature, and
enables us to be called and really to be the sons of God.

     ARTICLE IX : "I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH; THE COMMUNION OF
                                       SAINTS"




The Importance Of This Article

With what great diligence pastors ought to explain to the faithful the truth of this ninth Article will be easily
seen, if we attend chiefly to two considerations.

First, as St. Augustine observes, the Prophets spoke more plainly and openly of the Church than of Christ,
foreseeing that on this a much greater number may err and be deceived than on the mystery of the Incarnation.
For in after ages there would not be wanting wicked men who, like the ape that would fain pass for a man,
would claim that they alone were Catholics, and with no less impiety than effrontery assert that with them alone
is the Catholic Church.

The second consideration is that he whose mind is strongly impressed with the truth taught in this Article, will
easily escape the awful danger of heresy. For a person is not to be called a heretic as soon as he shall have
offended in matters of faith; but he is a heretic who, having disregarded the authority of the Church, maintains
impious opinions with pertinacity. Since, therefore, it is impossible that anyone be infected with the contagion
of heresy, so long as he holds what this Article proposes to be believed, let pastors use every diligence that the
faithful, having known this mystery and guarded against the wiles of Satan, may persevere in the true faith.

This Article hinges upon the preceding one; for, it having been already shown that the Holy Ghost is the source
and giver of all holiness, we here profess our belief that the Church has been endowed by Him with sanctity.




First Part Of This Article : "I Believe In The Holy Catholic Church

The Latins, having borrowed the word ecclesia (church) from the Greeks, have transferred it, since the
preaching of the Gospel, to sacred things. It becomes necessary, therefore, to explain its meaning.




"Church"

The word ecclesia (church) means a calling forth. But writers afterward used it to signify a meeting or
assembly, whether the people gathered together were members of a true or of a false religion. Thus in the Acts it
is written of the people of Ephesus that when the town-clerk had appeased a tumultuous assemblage he said:
And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful church. The Ephesians, who were
worshippers of Diana, are thus called a lawful church (ecclesia). Nor are the Gentiles only, who knew not God,
called a church (ecclesia); by the same name at times are also designated the councils of wicked and impious
men. I have hated the church (ecclesiam) of the malignant, says the Prophet, and with the wicked I will not sit.

In common Scripture usage, however, the word was subsequently employed to signify the Christian society
only, and the assemblies of the faithful; that is, of those who are called by faith to the light of truth and the
knowledge of God, that, having forsaken the darkness of ignorance and error, they may worship the living and
true God piously and holily, and serve Him from their whole heart. In a word, The Church, says St. Augustine,
consists of the faithful dispersed throughout the world.'




                                                         76
Mysteries Which The Word Church Comprises

In this word are contained important mysteries. For, in the calling forth, which it signifies, we recognise at once
the benignity and splendour of divine grace, and we understand that the Church is very unlike all other societies.
Other bodies rest on human reason and prudence, but the Church reposes on the wisdom and counsels of God
who has called us inwardly by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, who opens the hearts of men; and outwardly,
through the labor and ministry of pastors and preachers.

Moreover, the end of this vocation, that is, the knowledge and possession of things eternal will be at once
understood if we but remember why the faithful of the Old Law were called a Synagogue, that is, a flock for, as
St. Augustine teaches, they were so called, because, like cattle, which are wont to herd together. they looked
only to terrestrial and transitory goods. Wherefore, the Christian people are justly called, not a Synagogue, but a
Church, because, despising earthly and passing things, they pursue only things heavenly and eternal.




Other Names Given The Church In Scripture

Many names, moreover, which are replete with mysteries, have been used to designate the Christian body.
Thus, by the Apostle, it is called the house and edifice of God. If, says he to Timothy, I tarry long, that thou
mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God,
the pillar and ground of truth. The Church is called a house, because it is, as it were, one family governed by
one father of the family, and enjoying a community of all spiritual goods.

It is also called the flock of the sheep of Christ, of which He is the door and the shepherd. It is called the spouse
of Christ. I have espoused you to one husband, says the Apostle to the Corinthians, that I may present you as a
chaste virgin to Christ; and to the Ephesians: Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the church; and of
marriage: This is a great sacrament, but I speak in Christ and in the church.

Finally, the Church is called the body of Christ, as may be seen in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians.
Each of these appellations has very great influence in exciting the faithful to prove themselves worthy of the
boundless clemency and goodness of God, who chose them to be the people of God.




The Parts of the Church

These things having been explained, it will be necessary to enumerate the several component parts of the
Church, and to point out their difference, in order that the faithful may the better comprehend the nature,
properties, gifts, and graces of God's beloved Church, and by reason of them unceasingly praise the most holy
name of God.

The Church consists principally of two parts, the one called the Church triumphant; the other, the Church
militant. The Church triumphant is that most glorious and happy assemblage of blessed spirits, and of those who
have triumphed over the world, the flesh, and the iniquity of Satan, and are now exempt and safe from the
troubles of this life and enjoy everlasting bliss. The Church militant is the society of all the faithful still
dwelling on earth. It is called militant, because it wages eternal war with those implacable enemies, the world,
the flesh and the devil.

We are not, however, to infer that there are two Churches. The Church triumphant and the Church militant are
two constituent parts of one Church; one part going before, and now in the possession of its heavenly country;
the other, following every day, until at length, united with our Saviour, it shall repose in endless felicity.




                                                         77
The Members Of The Church Militant

The Church militant is composed of two classes of persons, the good and the bad, both professing the same faith
and partaking of the same Sacraments, yet differing in their manner of life and morality.

The good are those who are linked together not only by the profession of the same faith, and the participation of
the same Sacraments, but also by the spirit of grace and the bond of charity. Of these St. Paul says: The Lord
knoweth who are his. Who they are that compose this class we also may remotely conjecture, but we can by no
means pronounce with certainty. Hence Christ the Saviour does not speak of this portion of His Church when
He refers us to the Church and commands us to hear and to obey her. As this part of the Church is unknown,
how could we ascertain with certainty whose decision to recur to, whose authority to obey?

The Church, therefore, as the Scriptures and the writings of the Saints testify, includes within her fold the good
and the bad; and it was in this sense that St. Paul spoke of one body and one spirit. Thus understood, the Church
is known and is compared to a city built on a mountain, and visible from every side. As all must yield obedience
to her authority, it is necessary that she may-be known by all.

That the Church is composed of the good and the bad we learn from many parables contained in the Gospel.
Thus, the kingdom of heaven, that is, the Church militant, is compared to a net cast into the sea, to a field in
which tares were sown with the good grain, to a threshing floor on which the grain is mixed up with the chaff,
and also to ten virgins, some of whom were wise, and some foolish. And long before, we trace a figure and
resemblance of this Church in the ark of Noah, which contained not only clean, but also unclean animals.

But although the Catholic faith uniformly and truly teaches that the good and the bad belong to the Church, yet
the same faith declares that the condition of both is very different. The wicked are contained in the Church, as
the chaff is mingled with the grain on the threshing floor, or as dead members sometimes remain attached to a
living body.




Those Who Are Not Members Of The Church

Hence there are but three classes of persons excluded from the Church's pale: infidels, heretics and schismatics,
and excommunicated persons. Infidels are outside the Church because they never belonged to, and never knew
the Church, and were never made partakers of any of her Sacraments. Heretics and schismatics are excluded
from the Church, because they have separated from her and belong to her only as deserters belong to the army
from which they have deserted. It is not, however, to be denied that they are still subject to the jurisdiction of
the Church, inasmuch as they may be called before her tribunals, punished and anathematised. Finally,
excommunicated persons are not members of the Church, because they have been cut off by her sentence from
the number of her children and belong not to her communion until they repent.

But with regard to the rest, however wicked and evil they may be, it is certain that they still belong to the
Church: Of this the faithful are frequently to be reminded, in order to be convinced that, were even the lives of
her ministers debased by crime, they are still within the Church, and therefore lose nothing of their power.




Other Uses of the Word "Church"

Portions of the Universal Church are usually called churches, as when the Apostle mentions the Church at
Corinth, at Galatia, of the Laodiceans, of the Thessalonians.



                                                        78
The private families of the faithful he also calls churches. The church in the family of Priscilla and Aquila he
commands to be saluted; and in another place, he says: Aquila and Priscilla with the church that is in their house
salute you much in the Lord. Writing to Philemon, he makes use of the same word.

Sometimes, also, the word church is used to signify the prelates and pastors of the church. If he will not hear
thee, says our Lord, tell the church. Here the word church means the authorities of the-Church.

The place in which the faithful assemble to hear the Word of God, or for other religious purposes, is also called
a church. But in this Article, the word church is specially used to signify both the good and the bad, the
governed, as well as the governing.




The Marks Of The Church

The distinctive marks of the Church are also to be made known to the faithful, that thus they may be enabled to
estimate the extent of the blessing conferred by God on those who have had the happiness to be born and
educated within her pale.




"One'

The first mark of the true Church is described in the Nicene Creed, and consists in unity: My dove is one, my
beautiful one is one. So vast a multitude, scattered far and wide, is called one for the reasons mentioned by St.
Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians: One Lord, one faith, one baptism.




Unity In Government

The Church has but one ruler and one governor, the invisible one, Christ, whom the eternal Father hath made
head over all the Church, which is his body; the visible one, the Pope, who, as legitimate successor of Peter, the
Prince of the Apostles, fills the Apostolic chair.

It is the unanimous teaching of the Fathers that this visible head is necessary to establish and preserve unity in
the Church. This St. Jerome clearly perceived and as clearly expressed when, in his work against Jovinian, he
wrote: One is elected that, by the appointment of a head, all occasion of schism may be removed. In his letter to
Pope Damasus the same holy Doctor writes: Away with envy, let the ambition of Roman grandeur cease! I
speak to the successor of the fisherman, and to the disciple of the cross. Following no chief but Christ, I am
united in communion with your Holiness, that is, with the chair of Peter. I know that on that rock is built the
Church. Whoever will eat the lamb outside this house is profane; whoever is not in the ark of Noah shall perish
in the .flood.

The same doctrine was long before established by Saints Irenaeus and Cyprian. The latter, speaking of the unity
of the Church observes: The Lord said to Peter, I say to thee, Peter! thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will
build my Church. He builds His Church on one. And although after His Resurrection He gave equal power to all
His Apostles, saying: As the Father hath sent me, I also send you, receive ye the Holy Ghost; yet to make unity
more manifest, He decided by His own authority that it should be derived from one alone, etc.

Again, Optatus of Milevi says: You cannot be excused on the score of ignorance, knowing as you do that in the
city of Rome the episcopal chair was first conferred on Peter, who occupied it as head of the Apostles; in order
that in that one chair the unity of the Church might be preserved by all, and that the other Apostles might not


                                                        79
claim each a chair for himself; so that now he who erects another in opposition to this single chair is a
schismatic and a prevaricator.

Later on St. Basil wrote: Peter is made the foundation, because he says: Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living
God; and hears in reply that he is a rock. But although a rock, he is not such a rock as Christ; for Christ is truly
an immovable rock, but Peter, only by virtue of that rock. For Jesus bestows His dignities on others; He is a
priest, and He makes priests; a rock, and He makes a rock; what belongs to Himself, He bestows on His
servants.

Lastly, St. Ambrose says: Because he alone of all of them professed (Christ) he was placed above all.

Should anyone object that the Church is content with one Head and one Spouse, Jesus Christ, and requires no
other, the answer is obvious. For as we deem Christ not only the author of all the Sacraments, but also their
invisible minister -- He it is who baptises, He it is who absolves, although men are appointed by Him the
external ministers of the Sacraments -- so has He placed over His Church, which He governs by His invisible
Spirit, a man to be His vicar and the minister of His power. A visible Church requires a visible head; therefore
the Saviour appointed Peter head and pastor of all the faithful, when He committed to his care the feeding of all
His sheep, in such ample terms that He willed the very same power of ruling and governing the entire Church to
descend to Peter's successors.




Unity In Spirit, Hope And Faith

Moreover, the Apostle, writing to the Corinthians, tells them that there is but one and the same Spirit who
imparts grace to the faithful, as the soul communicates life to the members of the body. Exhorting the Ephesians
to preserve this unity, he says: Be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; one body and one
Spirit. As the human body consists of many members, animated by one soul, which gives sight to the eves,
hearing to the ears, and to the other senses the power of discharging their respective functions; so the mystical
body of Christ, which is the Church, is composed of many faithful. The hope, to which we are called, is also
one, as the Apostle tells us in the same place; for we all hope for the same consummation, eternal and happy
life. Finally, the faith which all are bound to believe and to profess is one: Let there be no schisms amongst you,
says the Apostle. And Baptism, which is the seal of our Christian faith, is also one.




"Holy"

The second mark of the Church is holiness, as we learn from these words of the Prince of the Apostles: You are
a chosen generation, a holy nation.

The Church is called holy because she is consecrated and dedicated to God; for so other things when set apart
and dedicated to the worship of God were wont to be called holy, even though they were material. Examples of
this in the Old Law were vessels, vestments and altars. In the same sense the first-born who were dedicated to
the Most High God were also called holy.

It should not be deemed a matter of surprise that the Church, although numbering among her children many
sinners, is called holy. For as those who profess any art, even though they depart from its rules, are still called
artists, so in like manner the faithful, although offending in many things and violating the engagements to which
they had pledged themselves, are still called holy, because they have been made the people of God and have
consecrated themselves to Christ by faith and Baptism. Hence, St. Paul calls the Corinthians sanctified and holy,
although it is certain that among them there were some whom he severely rebuked as carnal, and also charged
with grosser crimes.



                                                         80
The Church is also to be called holy because she is united to her holy Head, as His body; that is, to Christ the
Lord,' the fountain of all holiness, from whom flow the graces of the Holy Spirit and the riches of the divine
bounty. St. Augustine, interpreting these words of the Prophet: Preserve my soul, for I am holy," thus admirably
expresses himself: Let the body of Christ boldly say, let also that one man, exclaiming from the ends of the
earth, boldly say, with his Head, and under his Head, I am holy; for he received the grace of holiness, the grace
of Baptism and of remission of sins. And a little further on: If all Christians and all the faithful, having been
baptised in Christ, have put Him on, according to these words of the Apostle: "As many of you as have been
baptised in Christ, have put on Christ"; if they are made members of his body, and yet say they are not holy,
they do an injury to their Head, whose members are holy.

Moreover, the Church alone has the legitimate worship of sacrifice, and the salutary use of the Sacraments,
which are the efficacious instruments of divine grace, used by God to produce true holiness. Hence, to possess
true holiness, we must belong to this Church. The Church therefore it is clear, is holy, and holy because she is
the body of Christ, by whom she is sanctified, and in whose blood she is washed.




"Catholic"

The third mark of the Church is that she is Catholic; that is, universal. And justly is she called Catholic,
because, as St. Augustine says, she is diffused by the splendour of one faith from the rising to the setting sun."

Unlike states of human institution, or the sects of heretics, she is not confined to any one country or class of
men, but embraces within the amplitude of her love all mankind, whether barbarians or Scythians, slaves or
freemen, male or female. Therefore it is written: Thou . . . hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every
tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and hast made us to our God a kingdom. Speaking of the Church,
David says: Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for
thy possession; and also, I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me; and man is born in her.

Moreover to this Church, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, belong all the faithful who
have existed from Adam to the present day, or who shall exist, in the profession of the true faith, to the end of
time; all of whom are founded and raised upon the one corner-stone, Christ, who made both one, and announced
peace to them that are near and to them that are far.

She is also called universal, because all who desire eternal salvation must cling to and embrace her, like those
who entered the ark to escape perishing in the flood.. This (note of catholicity), therefore, is to be taught as a
most reliable criterion, by which to distinguish the true from a false Church.




Apostolic

The true Church is also to be recognised from her origin, which can be traced back under the law of grace to the
Apostles; for her doctrine is the truth not recently given, nor now first heard of, but delivered of old by the
Apostles, and disseminated throughout the entire world. Hence no one can doubt that the impious opinions
which heresy invents, opposed as they are to the doctrines taught by the Church from the days of the Apostles to
the present time, are very different from the faith of the true Church.

That all, therefore, might know which was the Catholic Church, the Fathers, guided by the Spirit of God, added
to the Creed the word Apostolic. For the Holy Ghost, who presides over the Church, governs her by no other
ministers than those of Apostolic succession. This Spirit, first imparted to the Apostles, has by the infinite
goodness of God always continued in the Church. And just as this one Church cannot err in faith or morals,
since it is guided by the Holy Ghost; so, on the contrary, all other societies arrogating to themselves the name of



                                                        81
church, must necessarily, because guided by the spirit of the devil, be sunk in the most pernicious errors, both
doctrinal and moral.




Figures of the Church

The figures of the Old Testament have great power to stimulate the minds of the faithful and to remind them of
these most beautiful truths. It was for this reason chiefly that the Apostles made use of these figures. The pastor,
therefore, should not overlook so fruitful a source of instruction.

Among these figures the ark of Noah holds a conspicuous place. It was built by the command of God, in order
that there might be no doubt that it was a symbol of the Church, which God has so constituted that all who enter
therein through Baptism, may be safe from danger of eternal death, while such as are outside the Church, like
those who were not in the ark, are overwhelmed by their own crimes.

Another figure presents itself in the great city of Jerusalem, which, in Scripture, often means the Church. In
Jerusalem only was it lawful to offer sacrifice to God, and in the Church of God only are to be found the true
worship and true sacrifice which can at all be acceptable to God.




"I Believe the Holy Catholic Church"

Finally, with regard to the Church, the pastor should teach how to believe the Church can constitute an Article
of faith. Although reason and the senses are able to ascertain the existence of the Church, that is, of a society of
men on earth devoted and consecrated to Jesus Christ, and although faith does not seem necessary in order to
understand a truth which even Jews and Turks do not doubt; nevertheless it is from the light of faith only, not
from the deductions of reason, that the mind can grasp those mysteries contained in the Church of God which
have been partly made known above and will again be treated under the Sacrament of Holy Orders.

Since, therefore, this Article, no less than the others, is placed above the reach, and defies the strength of the
human understanding, most justly do we confess that we know not from human reason, but contemplate with
the eyes of faith the origin, offices and dignity of the Church.

This Church was founded not by man, but by the immortal God Himself, who built her upon a most solid rock.
The Highest himself, says the Prophet, hath founded her. Hence, she is called the inheritance of God, the people
of God. The power which she possesses is not from man but from God.

Since this power, therefore, cannot be of human origin, divine faith can alone enable us to understand that the
keys of the. kingdom of heaven are deposited with the Church, that to her has been confided the power of
remitting sins," of denouncing excommunication, and of consecrating the real body of Christ; and t}tat her
children have not here a permanent dwelling, but look for one above.

We are, therefore, bound to believe that there is one Holy Catholic Church. With regard to the Three Persons of
the Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we not

only believe them, but also believe in them. But here we make use of a different form of expression, professing
to believe the holy, not in the holy Catholic Church. By this difference of expression we distinguish God, the
author of all things, from His works, and acknowledge that all the exalted benefits bestowed on the Church are
due to God's bounty.




                                                         82
Second Part of this Article: "The Communion of Saints"

The Evangelist St. John, writing to the faithful on the divine mysteries, explains as follows why he undertook to
instruct them in these truths: That you may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the Father,
and with his son Jesus Christ. This fellowship consists in the Communion of Saints, the subject of the present
Article.




Importance Of This Truth

Would that in its exposition pastors imitated the zeal of Paul and of the other Apostles. For not only is it a
development of the preceding Article and a doctrine productive of abundant fruit; it also teaches the use to be
made of the mysteries contained in the Creed, because the great end to which we should direct all our study and
knowledge of them is that we may be admitted into this most august and blessed society of the Saints, and may
steadily persevere therein, giving thanks with joy to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers
of the lot of the saints in light.




Meaning of "The Communion of Saints"

The faithful, therefore, in the first place are to be informed that this part of the Article, is, as it were, a sort of
explanation of the preceding part which regards the unity, sanctity and catholicity of the Church. For the unity
of the Spirit, by which she is governed, brings it about that whatsoever has been given to the Church is held as a
common possession by all her members.




Communion Of Sacraments

The fruit of all the Sacraments is common to all the faithful, and these Sacraments, particularly Baptism, the
door, as it were, by which we are admitted into the Church, are so many sacred bonds which bind and unite
them to Christ. That this communion of Saints implies a communion of Sacraments, the Fathers declare in these
words of the Creed: I confess one Baptism. After Baptism, the Eucharist holds the first place in reference to this
communion, and after that the other Sacraments; for although this name (communion) is applicable to all the
Sacraments, inasmuch as they unite us to God, and render us partakers of Him whose grace we receive, yet it
belongs in a peculiar manner to the Eucharist which actually produces this communion.




Communion Of Good Works

But there is also another communion in the Church which demands attention. Every pious and holy action done
by one belongs to and becomes profitable to all through charity, which seeketh not her Own. This is proved by
the testimony of St. Ambrose, who, explaining these words of the Psalmist, I am a partaker with all them that f
ear thee, observes: As we say that a limb is partaker of the entire body, so are we partakers with all that fear
God. Therefore has Christ taught us that form of prayer in which we say our, not my bread; and the other
Petitions are equally general, not confined to ourselves alone, but directed also to the common interest and the
salvation of all.

This communication of goods is often very aptly illustrated in Scripture by a comparison borrowed from the
members of the human body. In the human body there are many members, but though many, they yet constitute


                                                          83
but one body, in which each performs its own, not all the same, functions. All do not enjoy equal dignity, or
discharge functions alike useful or honourable; nor does one propose to itself its own exclusive advantage, but
that Of the entire body. Besides, they are so well organised

and knit together that if one suffers, the rest likewise suffer on account of their affinity and sympathy of nature;
and if, on the contrary, one enjoys health, the feeling of pleasure is common to all.

The same may be observed in the Church. She is composed of various members; that is, of different nations, of
Jews, Gentiles, freemen and slaves, of rich and poor; when they have been baptised, they constitute one body
with Christ, of which He is the Head. To each member of the Church is also assigned his own peculiar office.
As some are appointed apostles, some teachers, but all for the common good; so to some it belongs to govern
and teach, to others to be subject and to obey.




Those Who Share In This Communion

The advantages of so many and such exalted blessings bestowed by Almighty God are enjoyed by those who
lead a Christian life in charity, and are just and beloved of God. As to the dead members; that is, those who are
bound in the thraldom of sin and estranged from the grace of God, they are not so deprived of these advantages
as to cease to be members of this body; but since they are dead members, they do not share in the spiritual fruit
which is communicated to the just and pious. However, as they are in the Church, they are assisted in
recovering lost grace and life by those who live by the Spirit; and they also enjoy those benefits which are
without doubt denied to those who are entirely cut off from the Church.




Communion In Other Blessings

Not only the gifts which justify and endear us to God are common. Graces gratuitously granted, such as
knowledge, prophecy, the gifts of tongues and of miracles, and others of the same sort, are common also, and
are granted even to the wicked, not, however, for their own but for the general good, for the edification of the
Church. Thus, the gift of healing is given not for the sake of him who heals, but for the sake of him who is
healed.

In fine, every true Christian possesses nothing which he should not consider common to all others with himself,
and should therefore be prepared promptly to relieve an indigent fellow-creature. For he that is blessed with
worldly goods, and sees his brother in want, and will not assist him, is plainly convicted of not having the love
of God within him.

Those, therefore, who belong to this holy communion, it is manifest, do now enjoy a certain degree of happiness
and can truly say: How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts
of the Lord.... Blessed are they who dwell in thy house, Lord.




                               ARTICLE X : "THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS"




Importance Of This Article




                                                         84
The enumeration of this among the other Articles of the Creed is alone sufficient to satisfy us that it conveys a
truth, which is not only in itself a divine mystery, but also a mystery very necessary to salvation. We have
already said that, without a firm belief of all the Articles of the Creed, Christian piety is wholly unattainable.
However, should that which ought to be clear in itself seem to require the support of some authority, the
declaration of our Lord will suffice. A short time previous to His Ascension into heaven, when opening the
understanding of His disciples that they might understand the Scriptures, He bore testimony to this Article of
the Creed, in these words: It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day, and that
penance and remission of sins should be preached, in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

Let the pastor but weigh well these words, and he will readily perceive that the Lord has placed him under a
most sacred obligation, not only of making known to the faithful whatever regards religion in general, but also
of explaining with particular care this Article of the Creed.




The Church Has the Power of Forgiving Sins

On this point of doctrine, then, it is the duty of the pastor to teach that, not only is forgiveness of sins to be
found in the Catholic Church, as Isaias had foretold in these words: The people that dwell therein shall have
their iniquity taken away from them; but also that in her resides the power of forgiving sins; and furthermore
that we are bound to believe that this power, if exercised duly, and according to the laws prescribed by our
Lord, is such as truly to pardon and remit sins.




Extent of this Power:




All Sins That Precede Baptism

When we first make a profession of faith and are cleansed in holy Baptism, we receive this pardon entire and
unqualified; so that no sin, original or actual, of commission or omission, re- mains to be expiated, no
punishment to be endured. The grace of Baptism, however, does not give exemption from all the infirmities of
nature. On the contrary, contending, as each of us has to contend, against the motions of concupiscence, which
ever tempts us to the commission of sin, there is scarcely one to be found among us, who opposes so vigorous a
resistance to its assaults, or who guards his salvation so vigilantly, as to escape all wounds.




All Sins Committed After Baptism

It being necessary, therefore, that a power of forgiving sins, distinct from that of Baptism, should exist in the
Church, to her were entrusted the keys of the kingdom of heaven, by which each one, if penitent, may obtain the
remission of his sins, even though he were a sinner to the last day of his life. This truth is vouched for by the
most unquestionable authority of the Sacred Scriptures. In St. Matthew the Lord says to Peter: I will give to thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven;
and what- soever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven; and again: Whatsoever you shall bind
upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed also in
heaven.' Further, the testimony of St. John assures us that the Lord, breathing on the Apostles, said: Receive ye
the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are
retained. '




                                                         85
Limitation of this Power:




It Is Not Limited As To Sins, Persons, Or Time

Nor is the exercise of this power restricted to particular sins. No crime, however heinous, can be committed or
even conceived which the Church has not power to forgive, just as there is no sinner, however abandoned,
however depraved, who should not confidently hope for pardon, provided he sincerely repent of his past
transgressions.

Furthermore, the exercise of this power is not restricted to particular times. Whenever the sinner turns from his
evil ways he is not to be rejected, as we learn from the reply of our Saviour to the Prince of the Apostles. When
St. Peter asked how often we should pardon an offending brother, whether seven times, Not only seven times,
said the Redeemer, but till seventy times seven.




It Is Limited As To Its Ministers And Exercise

But if we look to its ministers, or to the manner in which it is to be exercised, the extent of this divine power
will not appear so great; for our Lord gave not the power of so sacred a ministry to all, but to Bishops and
priests only. The same must be said regarding the manner in which this power is to be exercised; for sins can be
forgiven only through the Sacraments, when duly administered. The Church has received no power otherwise to
remit sin. Hence it follows that in the forgiveness of sins both priests and Sacraments are, so to speak, the
instruments which Christ our Lord, the author and giver of salvation, makes use of, to accomplish in us the
pardon of sin and the grace of justification.




Greatness of this Power

To raise the admiration of the faithful for this heavenly gift, bestowed on the Church by God's singular mercy
towards us, and to make them approach its use with the more lively sentiments of devotion the pastor should
endeavour to point out the dignity and the extent of the grace which it imparts. If there be any one means better
calculated than another to accomplish this end, it is carefully to show how great must be the efficacy of that
which absolves from sin and restores the unjust to a state of justification.




Sin Can Be Forgiven Only By The Power Of God

This is manifestly an effect of the infinite power of God, of that same power which we believe to have been
necessary to raise the dead to life and to summon creation into existence. But if it be true, as the authority of St.
Augustine assures us it is, that to recall a sinner from the state of sin to that of righteousness is even a greater
work than to create the heavens and the earth from nothing, though their creation can be no other than the effect
of infinite power, it follows that we have still stronger reason to consider the remission of sins as an effect
proceeding from the exercise of this same infinite power.




                                                         86
With great truth, therefore, have the ancient Fathers declared that God alone can forgive sins, and that to His
infinite goodness and power alone is so wonderful a work to be referred. I am he, says the Lord Himself, by the
mouth of His Prophet, I am he who blotteth out your iniquities.

The remission of sins seems to bear an exact analogy to the cancelling of a pecuniary debt. None but the
creditor can forgive a pecuniary debt. Hence, since by sin we contract a debt to God alone -- wherefore we daily
pray: forgive us our debts sin, it is clear, can be forgiven by Him alone, and by none else.




This Power Communicated To None Before Christ

This wonderful and divine power was never communicated to creatures, until God became man. Christ our
Saviour, although true God, was the first one who, as man, received this high prerogative from His heavenly
Father. That you may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then said he to the man sick
of the palsy), rise. take up thy bed, and go into thy house. As, therefore, He became man, in order to bestow on
man this forgiveness of sins, He communicated this power to Bishops and priests in the Church, previous to His
Ascension into heaven, where He sits forever at the right hand of God. Christ, however, as we have already
said, remits sin by virtue of His own authority; all others, by virtue of His authority delegated to them as His
ministers.

If, therefore, whatever is the effect of infinite power claims our highest admiration and reverence, we must
readily perceive that this gift, bestowed on the Church by the bounteous hand of Christ our Lord, is one of
inestimable value.




Sin Remitted Through The Blood Of Christ

The manner too, in which God, in the fullness of His paternal clemency resolved to cancel the sins of the world
must powerfully move the faithful to contemplate the greatness of this blessing. It was His will that our offences
should be expiated by the blood of His Only-begotten Son; that His Son should voluntarily assume the
imputability of our sins, and suffer a most cruel death, the just for the unjust, the innocent for the guilty.

When, therefore, we reflect that we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as gold or silver, but with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled, we are naturally led to conclude that we could
have received no gift more salutary than this power of forgiving sins, which proclaims the ineffable Providence
of God and the excess of His love towards us. This reflection must produce in all the most abundant spiritual
fruit.




The Great Evil From Which Forgiveness Delivers Man

For whoever offends God, even by one mortal sin, instantly forfeits whatever merits he may have previously
acquired through the sufferings and death of Christ, and is entirely shut out from the gate of heaven which,
when already closed, was thrown open to all by the Redeemer's Passion. When we reflect on this, the thought of
our misery must fill us with deep anxiety. But if we turn our attention to this admirable power with which God
has invested His Church; and, in the firm belief of this Article, feel convinced that to every sinner is offered the
means of recovering, with the assistance of divine grace, his former dignity, we must exult with exceeding joy
and gladness, and must offer immortal thanks to God.




                                                        87
If, when we are seriously ill, the medicines prepared for us by the art and industry of the physician are wont to
be welcome and agreeable to us, how much more welcome and agreeable should those remedies prove which
the wisdom of God has established to heal our souls and restore us to the life of grace, especially since they
bring with them, not, indeed, uncertain hope of recovery, like the medicines that are applied to the body, but
assured health to such as desire to be cured !




Exhortation:




This Remedy To Be Used

The faithful, therefore, having formed a just conception of the dignity of so excellent and exalted a blessing,
should be exhorted to profit by it to the best of their ability. For he who makes no use of what is really useful
and necessary must be supposed to despise it; particularly since, in communicating to the Church the power of
forgiving sin, the Lord did so with the view that all should have recourse to this healing remedy. As without
Baptism no one can be cleansed, so in order to recover the grace of Baptism, forfeited by actual mortal guilt,
recourse must be had to another means of expiation, -- namely, the Sacrament of Penance.




Abuse To Be Guarded Against

But here the faithful are to be admonished to guard against the danger of becoming more prone to sin, or slow to
repentance, from a presumption that they can have recourse to this power of forgiving sins which is so complete
and, as we saw, unrestricted as to time. For, as such a propensity to sin would manifestly convict them of acting
injuriously and contumaciously to this divine power, and would therefore render them unworthy of the divine
mercy; so this slowness to repentance gives great reason to fear that, overtaken by death, they may in vain
confess their belief in the remission of sins, which by their tardiness and procrastination they deservedly
forfeited.




                         ARTICLE XI : "THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"




Importance Of This Article

That this Article supplies a convincing proof of the truth of our faith appears chiefly from the fact that not only
is it proposed in the Sacred Scriptures to the belief of the faithful, but is also confirmed by numerous arguments.
This we scarcely find to be the case with regard to the other Articles, which justifies the inference that on this
doctrine, as on its most solid basis, rests our hope of salvation; for according to the reasoning of the Apostle, If
there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again; and if Christ be not risen again, then is our
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

The diligence and zeal, therefore, of the pastor in the explanation of this dogma should not be less than the labor
which the impiety of many has expended in efforts to overthrow it. That eminently important advantages flow
to the faithful from the knowledge of this Article will be shown further on.




                                                        88
"The Resurrection of the Body"

That in this Article the resurrection of mankind is called the resurrection of the body, is a circumstance which
deserves special attention. It was not, indeed, so named without a reason for the Apostles intended thus to
convey a necessary truth, the immortality of the soul. Lest anyone, despite the fact that many passages of
Scripture plainly teach that the soul is immortal, might imagine that it dies with the body, and that both are to be
restored to life, the Creed speaks only of the resurrection of the body.

Although in Sacred Scripture the word flesh often signifies the whole man, as in Isaias, All flesh is grass, and in
St. John, The Word was made flesh; yet in this place it is used to express the body only, thus giving us to
understand that of the two constituent parts of man, soul and body, one only, that is, the body, is corrupted and
returns to its original dust, while the soul remains incorrupt and immortal. As then, a man cannot be said to
return to life unless he has previously died, so the soul could not with propriety be said to rise again.

The word body is also mentioned, in order to confute the heresy of Hymeneus and Philetus, who, during the
lifetime of the Apostle, asserted that whenever the Scriptures speak of the resurrection, they are to be
understood to mean not the resurrection of the body, but that of the soul, by which it rises from the death of sin
to the life of grace. The words of this Article, therefore, as is clear, exclude that error, and establish a real
resurrection of the body.




The Fact of the Resurrection:




Examples And Proofs Derived From Scripture

It will be the duty of the pastor to illustrate this truth by examples taken from the Old and New Testaments, and
from all ecclesiastical history. In the Old Testament, some were restored to life by Elias and Eliseus; and,
besides those who were raised to life by our Lord, many were raised by the holy Apostles and by many others.
These many resurrections confirm the doctrine taught by this Article; for believing that many were recalled
from death to life, we are also naturally led to believe the general resurrection of all. In fact the principal fruit
which we should derive from these miracles is to yield to this Article our most unhesitating belief.

To pastors ordinarily conversant with the Sacred Volumes many Scripture proofs of this Article will at once
present themselves. In the Old Testament the most conspicuous are those afforded by Job, when he says that in
his flesh he shall see his God, and by Daniel when, speaking of those who sleep in the dust of the earth, he says,
some shall awake to eternal life, others to eternal reproach. In the New Testament (the principal passages are)
those of St. Matthew, which record the disputation our Lord held with the Sadducees, and those in which the
Evangelists speak concerning the Last Judgment. To these we may also add the accurate reasoning of the
Apostle on the subject in his Epistles to the Corinthians and Thessalonians.




Analogies From Nature

But although the resurrection is most certainly established by faith, it will, notwithstanding, be of material
advantage to show from analogy and reason that what faith proposes is not at variance with nature or human
reason.

To one asking how the dead should rise again, the Apostle answers: Foolish man! that which thou sowest is not
quickened, except it die first; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare grain,



                                                         89
as of wheat, or of some of the rest; but God giveth it a body as he will; and a little after, It is sown in corruption,
it shall rise in incorruption.

St. Gregory calls our attention to many other arguments of analogy tending to the same effect. The sun, he says,
is every day withdrawn from our eyes, as it were, by dying, and is again recalled, as it were, by rising again;
trees lose, and again, as it were, by a resurrection, resume their verdure; seeds die by putrefaction, and rise again
by germination.




Arguments Drawn From Reason

The reasons also adduced by ecclesiastical writers seem well calculated to establish this truth. In the first place,
as the soul is immortal, and has, as part of man, a natural propensity to be united to the body, its perpetual
separation from it must be considered as unnatural. But as that which is contrary to nature and in a state of
violence, cannot be permanent, it appears fitting that the soul should be reunited to the body, and consequently
that the body should rise again. This argument our Saviour Himself employed, when in His disputation with the
Sadducees He deduced the resurrection of the body from the immortality of the soul."

In the next place, as an all-just God holds out punishments to the wicked and rewards to the good, and as very
many of the former depart this life unpunished for their crimes and many of the latter unrewarded for their
virtues, the soul should be reunited to the body, in order, as the partner of her crimes, or the companion of her
virtues, to become a sharer in her punishments or rewards. This argument has been admirably treated by St.
Chrysostom in his homily to the people of Antioch.

To this effect also, the Apostle, speaking of the resurrection, says: If in this life only, we have hope in Christ,
we are of all men the most miserable.. These words of St. Paul cannot be supposed to refer to the misery of the
soul; for since the soul is immortal, it is capable of enjoying happiness in a future life, even though the body did
not rise again. His words, then, must refer to the whole man; for, unless the body receive the due rewards of its
labours, those who, like the Apostles, endured so many afflictions and calamities in this life, would necessarily
be the most miserable of men. On this subject the Apostle is much more explicit in his Epistle to the
Thessalonians: We glory in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, in all your persecutions and
tribulations which you endure -- for an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of
the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer; seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them
that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
with the angels of his power, in a flame of fire, yielding vengeance to them who know not God, and who obey
not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Again, while the soul is separated from the body, man cannot enjoy that full happiness which is replete with
every good. For as a part separated from the whole is imperfect, the soul separated from the body must be
imperfect. Therefore, that nothing may be wanting to fill up the measure of its happiness, the resurrection of the
body is necessary.

By these, and similar arguments, the pastor will be able to instruct the faithful in this Article.




All Shall Rise

He should also carefully explain from the Apostle who are to be raised to life. Writing to the Corinthians, he
(St. Paul) says: As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.' Good and bad then, without
distinction, shall all rise from the dead, although the condition of all will not be the same. Those who have done
good, shall rise to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.



                                                          90
When we say all we mean those who will have died before the day of judgment, as well as those who will then
die. That the Church acquiesces in the opinion that all, without distinction, shall die, and that this opinion is
more consonant with truth, is the teaching of St. Jerome and of St. Augustine.

Nor does the Apostle in his Epistle to the Thessalonians dissent from this doctrine, when he says: The dead who
are in Christ shall rise first, then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the
clouds to meet Christ, into the air. St. Ambrose explaining these words says: In that very taking up, death shall
take place, as it were, in a deep sleep, and the soul, having gone forth from the body, shall instantly return. For
those who are alive shall die when they are taken up that, coming to the Lord, they may receive their souls from
His presence; because in His presence they cannot be dead. This opinion is supported by the authority of St.
Augustine in his book On the City of God."




The Body Shall Rise Substantially the Same

But as it is of vital importance to be fully convinced that the identical body, which belongs to each one of us
during life, shall, though corrupt and dissolved into its original dust, be raised up again to life, this too is a
subject which demands accurate explanation on the part of the pastor.

It is a truth conveyed by the Apostle when he says: This corruptible must put on incorruption, evidently
designating by the word this, his own body. It is also clearly expressed in the prophecy of Job: In my flesh I
shall see my God, whom I myself shall see, and mine eyes behold, and not another.

Further, this same truth is inferred from the very definition of resurrection; for resurrection, as Damascene
defines it, is a return to the state from which one has fallen.

Finally, if we bear in mind the arguments by which we have just established a future resurrection, every doubt
on the subject must at once disappear.

We have said that the body is to rise again, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according
as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. Man is, therefore, to rise again in the same body with which he
served God, or was a slave to the devil; that in the same body he may experience rewards and a crown of
victory, or endure the severest punishments and torments.




Restoration Of All That Pertains To The Nature And Adornment Of The Body

Not only will the body rise, but whatever belongs to the reality of its nature, and adorns and ornaments man will
be restored. For this we have the admirable words of St. Augustine: There




shall then be no deformity of body; if some have been overburdened with flesh, they shall not resume its entire
weight. All that exceeds the proper proportion shall be deemed superfluous. On the other hand, should the body
be wasted by disease or old age, or be emaciated from any other cause, it shall be repaired by the divine power
of Christ, who will not only restore the body unto us, but will repair whatever it shall have lost through the
wretchedness of this life. In another place he says: Man shall not resume his former hair, but shall be adorned
with such as will become him, according to the words: "The very hairs of your head are all numbered." God will
restore them according to His wisdom.




                                                         91
Restoration Of All That Pertains To The Integrity Of The Body

But the members especially, because they belong to the integrity of human nature, shall all be restored at once.
The blind from nature or disease, the lame, the maimed and the paralysed in any of their members shall rise
again with entire and perfect bodies. Otherwise the desires of the soul, which so strongly incline it to a union
with the body, would be far from satisfied; but we are convinced that in the resurrection these desires will be
fully realised.

Besides, the resurrection, like the creation, is clearly to be numbered among the principal works of God. As,
therefore, at the creation all things came perfect from the hand of God, we must admit that it will be the same in
the resurrection.

These observations are not to be restricted to the bodies of the martyrs, of whom St. Augustine says: As the
mutilation which they suffered would prove a deformity, they shall rise with all their members; otherwise those
who were beheaded would rise without a head. The scars, however, which they received shall remain, shining
like the wounds of Christ, with a brilliance far more resplendent than that of gold and of precious stones.

The wicked, too, shall rise with all their members, even with those lost through their own fault. The greater the
number of members which they shall have, the greater will be their torments; and therefore this restoration of
members will serve to increase not their happiness but their sorrow and misery; for merit or demerit is ascribed
not to the members, but to the person to whose body they are united. To those, therefore, who shall have done
penance, they shall be restored as sources of reward; and to those who shall have contemned it, as instruments
of punishment.

If the pastor gives attentive consideration to these things, he can never lack words or ideas to move the hearts of
the faithful, and enkindle in them the flame of piety; so that having before their minds the troubles and
calamities of this life, they may look forward with eager expectations to that blessed glory of the resurrection
which awaits the just.




The Condition of the Risen Body Shall be Different

It now remains for the faithful to understand how the body, when raised from the dead, although substantially
the same body that had been dead, shall be vastly different and changed in its condition.




Immortality

To omit other points, the chief difference between the state of all bodies when risen from the dead and what
they had previously been is that before the resurrection they were subject to dissolution, but when reanimated
they shall all, without distinction of good and bad, be invested with immortality.

This admirable restoration of nature, as the Scriptures testify, is the result of the glorious victory of Christ over
death. For it is written: He shall cast death down headlong for ever, and, O death! I will be thy death.'
Explaining these words the Apostle says: And the enemy death shall be destroyed last; and St. John also says:
Death shall be no more.

It was most fitting that the sin of Adam should be far exceeded by the merit of Christ the Lord, who overthrew
the empire of death. It was also in keeping with divine justice, that the good should enjoy endless felicity, while
the wicked, condemned to everlasting torments, shall seek death, and shall not find it, shall desire to die, and
death shall fly from them. Immortality, therefore, will be common to the good and to the bad.



                                                         92
The Qualities Of A Glorified Body

In addition to this, the bodies of the risen Saints will be distinguished by certain transcendent endowments,
which will ennoble them far beyond their former condition. Among these endowments four are specially
mentioned by the Fathers, which they infer from the doctrine of St. Paul, and which are called gifts.




Impassibility

The first endowment or gift is impassibility, which shall place them beyond the reach of suffering anything
disagreeable or of being affected by pain or inconvenience of any sort. Neither the piercing severity of cold, nor
the glowing intensity of heat, nor the impetuosity of waters can hurt them. It is sown says the Apostle, in
corruption, it shall rise in incorruption This quality the Schoolmen call impassibility, not incorruption, in order
to distinguish it as a property peculiar to a glorified body. The bodies of the damned, though incorruptible, will
not be impassible; they will be capable of experiencing heat and cold and of suffering various afflictions.




Brightness

The next quality is brightness, by which the bodies of the Saints shall shine like the sun, according to the words
of our Lord recorded in the Gospel of St. Matthew: The just shall shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their
Father. To remove the possibility of doubt on the subject, He exemplifies this in His Transfiguration. This
quality the Apostle sometimes calls glory, sometimes brightness: He will reform the body of our lowness, made
like to the body of his glory; " and again, It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. Of this glory the
Israelites beheld some image in the desert, when the face of Moses, after he had enjoyed the presence and
conversation of God, shone with such lustre that they could not look on it.

This brightness is a sort of radiance reflected on the body from the supreme happiness of the soul. It is a
participation in that bliss which the soul enjoys just as the soul itself is rendered happy by a participation in the
happiness of God.

Unlike the gift of impassibility, this quality is not common to all in the same degree. All the bodies of the Saints
will be equally impassible; but the brightness of all will not be the same, for, according to the Apostle, One is
the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars, for star differeth from star
in glory: so also is the resurrection of the dead.




Agility

To the preceding quality is united that which is called agility, by which the body will be freed from the
heaviness that now presses it down, and will take on a capability of moving with the utmost ease and swiftness,
wherever the soul pleases, as St. Augustine teaches in his book On the City of God, and St. Jerome On Isaias.
Hence these words of the Apostle: It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.




Subtility



                                                         93
Another quality is that of subtility, which subjects the body to the dominion of the soul, so that the body shall be
subject to the soul and ever ready to follow her desires. This quality we learn from these words of the Apostle:
It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.

These are the principal points which should be dwelt on in the exposition of this Article.




Advantages of Deep Meditation on this Article

But in order that the faithful may appreciate the fruit they derive from a knowledge of so many and such exalted
mysteries, it is necessary, first of all, to point out that to God, who has hidden these things from the wise and
made them known to little ones, we owe a debt of boundless gratitude. How many men, eminent for wisdom or
endowed with singular learning, who ever remained blind to this most certain truth ! The fact, then, that He has
made known to us these truths, although we could never have aspired to such knowledge, obliges us to pour
forth our gratitude in unceasing praises of His supreme goodness and clemency.

Another important advantage to be derived from reflection on this Article is that in it we shall find consolation
both for ourselves and others when we mourn the death of those who were endeared to us by relationship or
friendship. Such was the consolation which the Apostle himself gave the Thessalonians when writing to them
concerning those who are asleep.

Again, in all our afflictions and calamities the thought of a future resurrection must bring the greatest relief to
the troubled heart, as we learn from the example of holy Job, who supported his afflicted and sorrowing soul by
this one hope that the day would come when, in the resurrection, he would behold the Lord his God.

The same thought must also prove a powerful incentive to the faithful to use every exertion to lead lives of
rectitude and integrity, unsullied by the defilement of sin. For if they reflect that those boundless riches which
will follow after the resurrection are now offered to them as rewards, they will be easily attracted to the pursuit
of virtue and piety.

On the other hand, nothing will have greater effect in subduing the passions and withdrawing souls from sin,
than frequently to remind the sinner of the miseries and torments with which the reprobate will be visited, who
on the last day will come forth unto the resurrection of judgment.




                                   ARTICLE XII : "LIFE EVERLASTING"




Importance Of This Article

The holy Apostles, our guides, thought fit to conclude the Creed, which is the summary of our faith, with the
Article on eternal life: first, because after the resurrection of the body the only object of the Christian's hope is
the reward of everlasting life; and secondly, in order that perfect happiness, embracing as it does the fullness of
all good, may be ever present to our minds and absorb all our thoughts and affections.

In his instructions to the faithful the pastor, therefore, should unceasingly endeavour to light up in their souls an
ardent desire of the promised rewards of eternal life, so that whatever difficult duties he may inculcate as a part
of the Christian's life, the faithful may look upon as light, or even agreeable, and may yield a more willing and
cheerful obedience to God.




                                                         94
"Life Everlasting"

As many mysteries lie concealed under the words which are here used to declare the happiness reserved for us,
they are to be explained in such a manner as to make them intelligible to all, as far as each one's capacity will
allow.

The faithful, therefore, are to be informed that the words, life everlasting, signify not only continuance of
existence, which even the demons and the wicked possess, but also that perpetuity of happiness which is to
satisfy the desires of the blessed. In this sense they were understood by the lawyer mentioned in the Gospel
when he asked the Lord our Saviour: What shall I do to possess everlasting life? as if he had said, What shall I
do in order to arrive at the enjoyment of perfect happiness? In this sense these words are understood in the
Sacred Scriptures, as is clear from many passages.




"Everlasting"

The supreme happiness of the blessed is called by this name (life everlasting) principally to exclude the notion
that it consists in corporeal and transitory things, which cannot be everlasting. The word blessedness is
insufficient to express the idea, particularly as there have not been wanting men who, puffed up by the teachings
of a vain philosophy, would place the supreme good in sensible things. But these grow old and perish, while
supreme happiness is to be terminated by no lapse of time. Nay more, so far is the enjoyment of the goods of
this life from conferring real happiness that, on the contrary, he who is captivated by a love of the world is
farthest removed from true happiness; for it is written: Love not the world, nor the things which are in the
world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him, and a little farther on we read: The
world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof.

The pastor, therefore, should be careful to impress these truths on the minds of the faithful, that they may learn
to despise earthly things, and to know that in this world, in which we are not citizens but sojourners, happiness
is not to be found. Yet even here below we may be said with truth to be happy in hope, if denying ungodliness
and worldly desires, we . . . live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, looking for the blessed hope and
coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. Very many who seemed to themselves wise,
not understanding these things, and imagining that happiness was to be sought in this life, became fools and the
victims of the most deplorable calamities.

These words, life everlasting, also teach us that, contrary to the false notions of some, happiness once attained
can never be lost. Happiness is an accumulation of all good without admixture of evil, which, as it fills up the
measure of man's desires, must be eternal. He who is blessed with happiness must earnestly desire the continued
enjoyment of those goods which he has obtained. Hence, unless its possession be permanent and certain, he is
necessarily a prey to the most tormenting apprehension.




Life

The intensity of the happiness which the just enjoy in their celestial country, and its utter incomprehensibility to
all but themselves alone, are sufficiently conveyed by the very words blessed life. For when in order to express
any idea we make use of a word common to many things, it is clear that we do so because we have no exact
term by which to express it fully. Since, therefore, to express happiness, words are adopted which are not more
applicable to the blessed than to all who are to live for ever, this proves to us that the idea presents to the mind
something too great, too exalted, to be expressed fully by a proper term. True, the happiness of heaven is



                                                        95
expressed in Scripture by a variety of other words, such as the kingdom of God, of Christ, of heaven, paradise,
the holy city, the new Jerusalem, my Father's house; yet it is clear that none of these appellations is sufficient to
convey an adequate idea of its greatness.

The pastor, therefore, should not neglect the opportunity which this Article affords of inviting the faithful to the
practice of piety, of justice and of all the other Christian duties, by holding out to them such ample rewards as
are announced in the words life everlasting. Among the blessings which we instinctively desire life is certainly
esteemed one of the greatest. Now it is chiefly by this blessing that we describe the happiness (of the just) when
we say life everlasting. If, then, there is nothing more loved, nothing dearer or sweeter, than this short and
calamitous life, which is subject to so many and such various miseries that it should rather be called death; with
what ardour of soul, with what earnestness of purpose, should we not seek that eternal life which, without evil
of any sort, presents to us the pure and unmixed enjoyment of every good?




Negative and Positive Elements of Eternal Life

The happiness of eternal life is, as defined by the Fathers, an exemption from all evil, and an enjoyment of all
good.




The Negative

Concerning (the exemption from all) evil the Scriptures bear witness in the most explicit terms. For it is written
in the Apocalypse: They shall no more hunger nor thirst, neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat; '° and
again, God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor mourning nor crying, nor
sorrow shall be any more, for the former things are passed away.




The Positive

As for the glory of the blessed, it shall be without measure, and the kinds of their solid joys and pleasures
without number. Since our minds cannot grasp the greatness of this glory, nor can it possibly enter into our
souls, it is necessary for us to enter into it, that is, into the joy of the Lord, so that immersed therein we may
completely satisfy the longing of our hearts.

Although, as St. Augustine observes, it would seem easier to enumerate the evils from which we shall be
exempt than the goods and the pleasures which we shall enjoy; yet we must endeavour to explain, briefly and
clearly, these things which are calculated to inflame the faithful with a desire of arriving at the enjoyment of this
supreme felicity.

But first of all we should make use of a distinction which has been sanctioned by the most eminent writers on
religion; for they teach that there are two sorts of goods, one of which constitutes happiness, the other follows
upon it. The former, therefore, for the sake of perspicuity, they have called essential blessings, the latter,
accessory.




Essential Happiness




                                                          96
Solid happiness, which we may designate by the common appellation, essential, consists in the vision of God,
and the enjoyment of His beauty who is the source and principle of all goodness and perfection. This, says
Christ our Lord, is eternal life: that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
sent. These words St. John seems to interpret when he says: Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it
hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we
shawl see him as he is. He shows, then, that beatitude consists of two things: that we shall behold God such as
He is in His own nature and substance; and that we ourselves shall become, as it were, gods.




The Light Of Glory

For those who enjoy God while they retain their own nature, assume a certain admirable and almost divine
form, so as to seem gods rather than men. Why this transformation takes place becomes at once intelligible if
we only reflect that a thing is known either from its essence, or from its image and appearance, consequently, as
nothing so resembles God as to afford by its resemblance a perfect knowledge of Him, it follows that no
creature can behold His Divine Nature and Essence unless this same Divine Essence has joined itself to us, and
this St. Paul means when he says: We now see through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face.' The
words, in a dark manner, St. Augustine understands to mean that we see Him in a resemblance calculated to
convey to us some notion of the Deity.

This St. Denis' also clearly shows when he says that the things above cannot be known by comparison with the
things below; for the essence and substance of anything incorporeal cannot be known through the image of that
which is corporeal, particularly as a resemblance must be less gross and more spiritual than that which it
represents, as we easily know from universal experience. Since, therefore, it is impossible that any image drawn
from created things should be equally pure and spiritual with God, no resemblance can enable us perfectly to
comprehend the Divine Essence. Moreover, all created things are circumscribed within certain limits of
perfection, while God is without limits; and therefore nothing created can reflect His immensity.

The only means, then, of arriving at a knowledge of the Divine Essence is that God unite Himself in some sort
to us, and after an incomprehensible manner elevate our minds to a higher degree of perfection, and thus render
us capable of contemplating the beauty of His Nature. This the light of His glory will accomplish. Illumined by
its splendour we shall see God, the true light, in His own light.




The Beatific Vision

For the blessed always see God present and by this greatest and most exalted of gifts, being made partakers of
the divine nature, they enjoy true and solid happiness. Our belief in this happiness should be joined with an
assured hope that we too shall one day, through the divine goodness, attain it. This the Fathers declared in their
Creed, which says: I expect the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.




An Illustration Of This Truth

These are truths, so divine that they cannot be expressed in any words or comprehended by us in thought. We
may, however, trace some resemblance of this happiness in sensible objects. Thus, iron when acted on by fire
becomes inflamed and while it is substantially the same seems changed into fire, a different substance; so
likewise the blessed, who are admitted into the glory of heaven and burn with a love of God, are so affected
that, without ceasing to be what they are, they may be said with truth to differ more from those still on earth
than red-hot iron differs from itself when cold.



                                                        97
To say all in a few words, supreme and absolute happiness, which we call essential, consists in the possession of
God; for what can he lack to consummate his happiness who possesses the God of all goodness and perfection?




Accessory Happiness

To this happiness, however, are added certain gifts which are common to all the blessed, and which, because
more within the reach of human comprehension, are generally found more effectual in moving and inflaming
the heart. These the Apostle seems to have in view when, in his Epistle to the Romans, he says: Glory and
honour, and peace to every one that worketh good.




Glory

For the blessed shall enjoy glory; not only that glory which we have already shown to constitute essential
happiness, or to be its inseparable accompaniment, but also that glory which consists in the clear and distinct
knowledge which each (of the blessed) shall have of the singular and exalted dignity of his companions (in
glory).




Honour

And how distinguished must not that honour be which is conferred by God Himself, who no longer calls them
servants, but friends, brethren and sons of God! Hence the Redeemer will address His elect in these most loving
and honourable words: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you. Justly, then,
may we exclaim: Thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable. They shall also receive the highest
praise from Christ the Lord, in presence of His heavenly Father and His Angels.

And if nature has implanted in the heart of every man the common desire of securing the esteem of men
eminent for wisdom, because they are deemed the most reliable judges of merit, what an accession of glory to
the blessed, to show towards each other the highest veneration !




Peace

To enumerate all the delights with which the souls of the blessed shall be filled would be an endless task. We
cannot even conceive them in thought. With this truth, however, the minds of the faithful should be deeply
impressed -- that the happiness of the Saints is full to overflowing of all those pleasures which can be enjoyed
or even desired in this life, whether they regard the powers of the mind or of the perfection of the body; albeit
this must be in a manner more exalted than, to use the Apostle's words, eye hath seen, ear heard, or the heart of
man conceived.

Thus the body, which was before gross and material, shall put off in heaven its mortality, and having become
refined and spiritualised, will no longer require corporal food; while the soul shall be satiated to its supreme
delight with that eternal food of glory which the Master of that great feast passing will minister to all.

Who will desire rich apparel or royal robes, where there shall be no further use for such things, and where all
shall be clothed with immortality and splendour, and adorned with a crown of imperishable glory?



                                                        98
And if the possession of a spacious and magnificent mansion contributes to human happiness, what more
spacious, what more magnificent, can be conceived than heaven itself, which is illumined throughout with the
brightness of God ? Hence the Prophet, contemplating the beauty of this dwelling-place, and burning with the
desire of reaching those mansions of bliss, exclaims: How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! my soul
longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. That the
faithful may be all filled with the same sentiments and utter the same language should be the object of the
pastor's most earnest desires, as it should also be of his zealous labours. For in my Father's house, says our
Lord, there are many mansions," in which shall be distributed rewards of greater and of less value according to
each one's deserts. He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall
also reap blessings.




How to Arrive at the Enjoyment of this Happiness

The pastor, therefore, should not only encourage the faithful to seek this happiness, but should frequently
remind them that the sure way of obtaining it is to possess the virtues of faith and charity, to persevere in prayer
and the use of the Sacraments, and to discharge all the duties of kindness towards their neighbour.

Thus, through the mercy of God, who has prepared that blessed glory for those who love Him, shall be one day
fulfilled the words of the Prophet: My people shall sit in the beauty of peace, and in the tabernacle of
confidence, and in wealthy rest.




                                    PART II : THE SACRAMENTS



Importance Of Instruction On The Sacraments

The exposition of every part of Christian doctrine demands knowledge and industry on the part of the pastor.
But instruction on the Sacraments, which, by the ordinance of God, are a necessary means of salvation and a
plenteous source of spiritual advantage, demands in a special manner his talents and industry By accurate and
frequent instruction (on the Sacraments) the faithful will be enabled to approach worthily and with salutary
effect these inestimable and most holy institutions; and the priests will not depart from the rule laid down in the
divine prohibition: Give not that which is holy to dogs: neither cast ye your pearls before swine.




The Word "Sacrament"

Since, then, we are about to treat of the Sacraments in general, it is proper to begin in the first place by
explaining the force and meaning of the word Sacrament, and showing its various significations, in order the
more easily to comprehend the sense in which it is here used. The faithful, therefore, are to be informed that the
word Sacrament, in so far as it concerns our present purpose, is differently understood by sacred and profane
writers.

By some it has been used to express the obligation which arises from an oath, pledging to the performance of
some service; and hence the oath by which soldiers promise military service to the State has been called a
military sacrament. Among profane writers this seems to have been the most ordinary meaning of the word.




                                                        99
But by the Latin Fathers who have written on theological subjects, the word sacrament is used to signify a
sacred thing which lies concealed. The Greeks, to express the same idea, made use of the word mystery. This
we understand to be the meaning of the word, when, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, it is said: That he might
make known to us the mystery (sacramentum) of his will; and to Timothy: great is the mystery (sacramentum)
of godliness; and in the Book of Wisdom: They knew not the secrets (sacramenta) of God. In these and many
other passages the word sacrament,- it will be perceived, signifies nothing more than a holy thing that lies
concealed and hidden.

The Latin Doctors, therefore, deemed the word a very appropriate term to express certain sensible signs which
at once communicate grace, declare it, and, as it were, place it before the eyes. St. Gregory, however, is of the
opinion that such a sign is called a Sacrament, because the divine power secretly operates our salvation under
the veil of sensible things.

Let it not, however, be supposed that the word sacrament is of recent ecclesiastical usage. Whoever peruses the
works of Saints Jerome and Augustine will at once perceive that ancient ecclesiastical writers made use of the
word sacrament, and some times also of the word symbol, or mystical sign or sacred sign, to designate that of
which we here speak.

So much will suffice in explanation of the word sacrament. What we have said applies equally to the
Sacraments of the Old Law; but since they have been superseded by the Gospel Law and grace, it is not
necessary that pastors give instruction concerning them.




Definition of a Sacrament

Besides the meaning of the word, which has hitherto engaged our attention, the nature and efficacy of the thing
which the word signifies must be diligently considered, and the faithful must be taught what constitutes a
Sacrament. No one can doubt that the Sacraments are among the means of attaining righteousness and salvation.
But of the many definitions, each of them sufficiently appropriate, which may serve to explain the nature of a
Sacrament, there is none more comprehensive, none more perspicuous, than the definition given by St.
Augustine and adopted by all scholastic writers. A Sacrament, he says, is a sign of a sacred thing; or, as it has
been expressed in other words of the same import: A Sacrament is a visible sign of an invisible grace, instituted
for our justification.




"A Sacrament is a Sign"

The more fully to develop this definition, the pastor should ex plain it in all its parts. He should first observe
that sensible objects are of two sorts: some have been invented precisely to serve as signs; others have been
established not for the sake of signifying something else, but for their own sakes alone. To the latter class
almost every object in nature may be said to belong; to the former, spoken and written languages, military
standards, images, trumpets, signals a and a multiplicity of other things of the same sort. Thus with regard to
words; take away their power of expressing ideas, and you seem to take away the only reason for their
invention. Such things are, therefore, properly called signs. For, according to St. Augustine, a sign, besides what
it presents to the senses, is a medium through which we arrive at the knowledge of something else. From a
footstep, for instance, which we see traced on the ground, we instantly infer that some one whose trace appears
has passed.




Proof From Reason



                                                       100
A Sacrament, therefore, is clearly to be numbered among those things which have been instituted as signs. It
makes known to us by a certain appearance and resemblance that which God, by His invisible power,
accomplishes in our souls. Let us illustrate what we have said by an example. Baptism, for instance, which is
administered by external ablution, accompanied with certain solemn words, signifies that by the power of the
Holy Ghost all stain and defilement of sin is inwardly washed away, and that the soul is enriched and adorned
with the admirable gift of heavenly justification; while, at the same time, the bodily washing, as we shall
hereafter explain in its proper place, accomplishes in the soul that which it signifies.




Proof From Scripture

That a Sacrament is to be numbered among signs is dearly inferred also from Scripture. Speaking of
circumcision, a Sacrament of the Old Law which was given to Abraham, the father of all believers," the Apostle
in his Epistle to the Romans, says: And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith. In
another place he says: All we who are baptised in Christ Jesus, are baptised in his death, words which justify the
inference that Baptism signifies, to use the words of the same Apostle, that we are buried together with him by
baptism into death.

Nor is it unimportant that the faithful should know that the Sacraments are signs. This knowledge will lead them
more readily to believe that what the Sacraments signify, contain and effect is holy and august; and recognising
their sanctity they will be more disposed to venerate and adore the beneficence of God displayed towards us.




"Sign of a Sacred Thing" : Kind of Sign Meant Here

We now come to explain the words, sacred thing, which constitute the second part of the definition. To render
this explanation satisfactory we must enter somewhat more minutely into the accurate and acute remarks of St.
Augustine on the variety of signs.




Natural Signs

Some signs are called natural. These, besides making themselves known to us, also convey a knowledge of
something else, an effect, as we have already said, common to all signs. Smoke, for instance, is a natural sign
from which we immediately infer the existence of fire. It is called a natural sign, because it implies the
existence of fire, not by arbitrary institution, but from experience. If we see smoke, we are at once convinced of
the presence of fire, even though it is hidden.




Signs Invented By Man,

Other signs are not natural, but conventional, and are invented by men to enable them to converse one with
another, to convey their thoughts to others, and in turn to learn the opinions and receive the advice of other men.
The variety and multiplicity of such signs may be inferred from the fact that some belong to the eyes, many to
the ears, and the rest to the other senses. Thus when we intimate any thing to another by such a sensible sign as
the raising of a flag, it is obvious that such intimation is conveyed only through the medium of the eyes; and it
is equally obvious that the sound of the trumpet, of the lute and of the lyre,-instruments which are not only
sources of pleasure, but frequently signs of ideas -- is addressed to the ear. Through the latter sense especially
are also conveyed words, which are the best medium of communicating our inmost thoughts.



                                                       101
Signs Instituted By God

Besides the signs instituted by the will and agreement of men, of which we have been speaking so far, there are
certain other signs appointed by God. These latter, as all admit, are not all of the same kind. Some were
instituted by God to indicate something or to bring back its recollection. Such were the purifications of the Law,
the unleavened bread, and many other things which belonged to the ceremonies of the Mosaic worship. But God
has appointed other signs with power not only to signify, but also to accomplish (what they signify).

Among these are manifestly to be numbered the Sacraments of the New Law. They are signs instituted not by
man but by God, which we firmly believe have in themselves the power of producing the sacred effects of
which they are the signs.




Kind of Sacred Thing Meant Here

We have seen that there are many kinds of signs. The sacred thing referred to is also of more than one kind. As
regards the definition already given of a Sacrament, theologians prove that by the words sacred thing is to be
understood the grace of God, which sanctifies the soul and adorns it with the habit of all the divine virtues; and
of this grace they rightly consider the words sacred thing, an appropriate appellation, because by its salutary
influence the soul is consecrated and united to God.

In order, therefore, to explain more fully the nature of a Sacrament, it should be taught that it is a sensible object
which possesses, by divine institution, the power not only of signifying, but also of accomplishing holiness and
righteousness. Hence it follows, as everyone can easily see, that the images of the Saints, crosses and the like,
although signs of sacred things, cannot be called Sacraments. That such is the nature of a Sacrament is easily
proved by the example of all the Sacraments, if we apply to the others what has been already said of Baptism;
namely, that the solemn ablution of the body not only signifies, but has power to effect a sacred thing which is
wrought interiorly by the operation of the Holy Ghost.




Other Sacred Things Signified By The Sacraments

Now it is especially appropriate that these mystical signs, instituted by God, should signify by the appointment
of the Lord not only one thing, but several things at once.




All The Sacraments Signify Something Present, Something Past, Something Future:

This applies to all the Sacraments; for all of them declare not only our sanctity and justification, but also two
other things most intimately connected with sanctification, namely, the Passion of Christ our Redeemer, which
is the source of our sanctification, and also eternal life and heavenly bliss, which are the end of sanctification.
Such, then, being the nature of all the Sacraments, holy Doctors justly hold that each of them has a threefold
significance: they remind us of something past; they indicate and point out something present; they foretell
something future.

Nor should it be supposed that this teaching of the Doctors is unsupported by the testimony of Holy Scripture.
When the Apostle says: All we who are baptised in Christ Jesus, are baptised in his death, he gives us clearly to
understand that Baptism is called a sign, because it reminds us of the death and Passion of our Lord. When he


                                                        102
says, We are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory
of the Father, so, we also may walk in newness of life, he also clearly shows that Baptism is a sign which
indicates the infusion of divine grace into our souls, which enables us to lead a new life and to perform all the
duties of true piety with ease and cheerfulness. Finally, when he adds: If we have been planted together in the
likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, he teaches that Baptism clearly
foreshadows eternal life also, which we are to reach through its efficacy.




A Sacrament Sometimes Signifies The Presence Of More Than One Thing

Besides the different significations already mentioned, a Sacrament also not infrequently indicates and marks
the presence of more than one thing. This we readily perceive when we reflect that the Holy Eucharist at once
signifies the presence of the real body and blood of Christ and the grace which it imparts to the worthy receiver
of the sacred mysteries.

What has been said, therefore, cannot fail to supply the pastor with arguments to prove how much the power of
God is displayed, how many hidden miracles are contained in the Sacraments of the New Law; that thus all may
understand that they are to be venerated and received with utmost devotion.'




Why the Sacraments were Instituted

Of all the means employed to teach the proper use of the Sacraments, there is none more effectual than a careful
exposition of the reasons of their institution. Many such reasons are commonly assigned.

The first of these reasons is the feebleness of the human mind. We are so constituted by nature that no one can
aspire to mental and intellectual knowledge unless through the medium of sensible objects. In order, therefore,
that we might more easily understand what is accomplished by the hidden power of God, the same sovereign
Creator of the universe has most wisely, and out of His tender kindness towards us, ordained that His power
should be manifested to us through the intervention of certain sensible signs. As St. Chrysostom happily
expresses it: If man were not clothed with a material body, these good things would have been presented to him
naked and without any covering; but as the soul is joined to the body, it was absolutely necessary to employ
sensible things in order to assist in making them understood.

Another reason is because the mind yields a reluctant assent to promises. Hence, from the beginning of the
world, God was accustomed to indicate, and usually in words, that which He had resolved to do; but sometimes,
when designing to execute something, the magnitude of which might weaken a belief in its accomplishment, He
added to words other signs, which sometimes appeared miraculous. When, for instance, God sent Moses to
deliver the people of Israel, and Moses, distrusting the help even of God who had commissioned him, feared
that the burden imposed was heavier than he could bear, or that the people would not heed his message, the
Lord confirmed His promise by a great variety of signs. As, then, in the Old Law, God ordained that every
important promise should be confirmed by certain signs, so in the New Law, Christ our Saviour, when He
promised pardon of sin, divine grace, the communication of the Holy Spirit, instituted certain visible and
sensible signs by which He might oblige Himself, as it were, by pledges, and make it impossible to doubt that
He would be true to His promises.

A third reason is that the Sacraments, to use the words of St. Ambrose, may be at hand, as the remedies and
medicines of the Samaritan in the Gospel, to preserve or recover the health of the soul. For, through the
Sacraments, as through a channel, must flow into the soul the efficacy of the Passion of Christ, that is, the grace
which He merited for us on the altar of the cross, and without which we cannot hope for salvation. Hence, our
most merciful Lord has bequeathed to His Church, Sacraments stamped with the sanction of His word and



                                                       103
promise, through which, provided we make pious and devout use of these remedies, we firmly believe that the
fruit of His Passion is really communicated to us.

A fourth reason why the institution of the Sacraments seems necessary is that there may be certain marks and
symbols to distinguish the faithful; particularly since, as St. Augustine observes, no society of men, professing a
true or a false religion, can be, so to speak, consolidated into one body, unless united and held together by some
bond of sensible signs. Both these objects the Sacraments of the New Law accomplish, distinguishing the
Christian from the infidel, and uniting the faithful by a sort of sacred bond.

Another very just cause for the institution of the Sacraments may be shown from the words of the Apostle: With
the heart we believe unto justice; but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. By approaching them
we make a public profession of our faith in the sight of men. Thus, when we approach Baptism, we openly
profess our belief that, by virtue of its salutary waters in which we are washed, the soul is spiritually cleansed.

The Sacraments have also great influence, not only in exciting and exercising our faith, but also in inflaming
that charity with which we should love one another, when we recollect that, by partaking of these mysteries in
common, we are knit together in the closest bonds and are made members of one body.

A final consideration, which is of greatest importance for the life of a Christian, is that the Sacraments repress
and subdue the pride of the human heart, and exercise us in the practice of humility; for they oblige us to subject
ourselves to sensible elements in obedience to God, from whom we had before impiously revolted in order to
serve the elements of the world.

These are the chief points that appeared to us necessary for the instruction of the faithful on the name, nature,
and institution of a Sacrament. When they shall have been accurately expounded by the pastor, his next duty
will be to explain the constituents of each Sacrament, its parts, and the rites and ceremonies which have been
added to its administration.




Constituent Parts of the Sacraments

In the first place, then, it should be explained that the sensible thing which enters into the definition of a
Sacrament as already given, although constituting but one sign, is twofold. Every Sacrament consists of two
things, matter, which is called the element, and form, which is commonly called the word.

This is the doctrine of the Fathers of the Church; and the testimony of St. Augustine on the subject is familiar to
all. The word, he says, is joined to the element and it becomes a Sacrament. By the words sensible thing,
therefore, the Fathers understand not only the matter or element, such as water in Baptism, chrism in
confirmation, and oil in Extreme Unction, all of which fall under the eye; but also the words which constitute
the form, and which are addressed to the ear.

Both are clearly pointed out by the Apostle, when he says: Christ loved the Church, and delivered himself up
for it, that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life. Here both the matter and
form of the Sacrament are expressly mentioned.

In order to make the meaning of the rite that is being performed easier and clearer, words had to be added to the
matter. For of all signs words are evidently the most significant, and without them, what the matter for the
Sacraments designates and declares would be utterly obscure. Water, for instance, has the quality of cooling as
well as cleansing, and may be symbolic of either. In Baptism, therefore, unless the words were added, it would
not be certain, but only conjectural, which signification was intended; but when the words are added, we
immediately understand that the Sacrament possesses and signifies the power of cleansing.




                                                         104
In this the Sacraments of the New Law excel those of the Old that, as far as we know, there was no definite
form of administering the latter, and hence they were very uncertain and obscure. In our Sacraments, on the
contrary, the form is so definite that any, even a casual deviation from it renders the Sacrament null. Hence the
form is expressed in the clearest terms, such as exclude the possibility of doubt.

These, then, are the parts which belong to the nature and substance of the Sacraments, and of which every
Sacrament is necessarily composed.




Ceremonies Used in the Administration of the Sacraments

To (the matter and form) are added certain ceremonies. These cannot be omitted without sin, unless in case of
necessity; yet, if at any time they be omitted, the Sacrament is not thereby invalidated, since the ceremonies do
not pertain to its essence. It is not without good reason that the administration of the Sacraments has been at all
times, from the earliest ages of the Church, accompanied with certain solemn rites.

There is, in the first place, the greatest propriety in manifesting such a religious reverence to the sacred
mysteries as to make it appear that holy things are handled by holy men.

Secondly, these ceremonies serve to display more fully the effects of the Sacraments, placing them, as it were,
before our eyes, and to impress more deeply on the minds of the faithful the sanctity of these sacred institutions.

Thirdly, they elevate to sublime contemplation the minds of those who behold and observe them with attention,
and excite within them faith and charity.

To enable the faithful, therefore, to know and understand clearly the meaning of the ceremonies made use of in
the administration of each Sacrament should be an object of special care and attention.




The Number Of The Sacraments

We now come to explain the number of the Sacraments. A knowledge of this point is very advantageous to the
faithful; for the greater the number of aids to salvation and the life of bliss which they understand to have been
provided by God, the more ardent will be the piety with which they will direct all the powers of their souls to
praise and proclaim His singular goodness towards us.

The Sacraments of the Catholic Church are seven in number, as is proved from Scripture, from the tradition
handed down to us from the Fathers, and from the authority of Councils. Why they are neither more nor less in
number may be shown, at least

with some probability, from the analogy that exists between the natural and the spiritual life. In order to exist, to
preserve existence, and to contribute to his own and to the public good, seven things seem necessary to man: to
be born, to grow, to be nurtured, to be cured when sick, when weak to be strengthened; as far as regards the
public welfare, to have magistrates invested with authority to govern, and to perpetuate himself and his species
by legitimate offspring. Now, since it is quite clear that all these things are sufficiently analogous to that life by
which the soul lives to God, we discover in them a reason to account for the number of the Sacraments.

First comes Baptism, which is the gate, as it were, to all the other Sacraments, and by which we are born again
unto Christ. The next is Confirmation, by which we grow up and are strengthened in the grace of God; for, as
St. Augustine observes, to the Apostles who had already received Baptism, the Redeemer said: "Stay you in the
city till you be endued with power from on high.,, The third is the Eucharist, that true bread from heaven which


                                                        105
nourishes and sustains our souls to eternal life, according to these words of the Saviour: My flesh is meat
indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. The fourth is Penance, through which lost health is recovered after we
have been wounded by sin. Next is Extreme Unction, which obliterates the remains of sin and invigorates the
powers of the soul; for speaking of this Sacrament St. James says: If he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.
Then follows Holy Orders, by which power is given to exercise perpetually in the Church the public
administration of the Sacraments and to perform all the sacred functions. The last is Matrimony, instituted to the
end that, by means of the legitimate and holy union of man and woman, children may be procreated and
religiously educated for the service of God, and for the preservation of the human race.




Comparisons among the Sacraments

Though all the Sacraments possess a divine and admirable efficacy, it is well worthy of special remark that all
are not of equal necessity or of equal dignity, nor is the signification of all the same.

Among them three are said to be necessary beyond the rest, although in all three this necessity is not of the same
kind. The universal and absolute necessity of Baptism our Saviour has declared in these words: Unless a man be
born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Penance, on the other hand,
is necessary for those only who have stained themselves after Baptism by any mortal guilt. Without sincere
repentance, their eternal ruin is inevitable. Orders, too, although not necessary to each of the faithful, are of
absolute necessity to the Church as a whole.

But if we consider the dignity of the Sacraments, the Eucharist, for holiness and for the number and greatness of
its mysteries, is far superior to all the rest. These, however, are matters which will be more easily understood,
when we come to explain, in its proper place, what regards each of the Sacraments.




The Author of the Sacraments

It now remains to inquire from whom we have received these sacred and divine mysteries. Any gift, however
excellent in itself, undoubtedly receives an increased value from the dignity and excellence of him by whom it
is bestowed.

The present question, however, is not hard to answer. For since human justification comes from God, and since
the Sacraments are the wonderful instruments of justification, it is evident that one and the same God in Christ,
must be acknowledged to be the author of justification and of the Sacraments.

Furthermore, the Sacraments contain a power and efficacy which reach the inmost soul; and as God alone has
power to enter into the hearts and minds of men, He alone, through Christ, is manifestly the author of the
Sacraments.

That they are also interiorly dispensed by Him we must hold with a firm and certain faith, according to these
words of St. John, in which he declares that he learned this truth concerning Christ: He who sent me to baptise
with water, said to me: He, upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, he it is
that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.




The Ministers of the Sacraments




                                                      106
But although God is the author and dispenser of the Sacraments, He nevertheless willed that they should be
administered in His Church by men, not by Angels. To constitute a Sacrament, as the unbroken tradition of the
Fathers testifies, matter and form are not more necessary than is the ministry of men.




Unworthiness Of The Minister And Validity

Since the ministers of the Sacraments represent in the discharge of their sacred functions, not their own, but the
person of Christ, be they good or bad, they validly perform and confer the Sacraments, provided they make use
of the matter and form always observed in the Catholic Church according to the institution of Christ, and
provided they intend to do what the Church does in their administration. Hence, unless the recipients wish to
deprive themselves of so great a good and resist the Holy Ghost, nothing can prevent them from receiving
(through the Sacraments) the fruit of grace.

That this was, at all times, a fixed and well ascertained doctrine of the Church, is established beyond all doubt
by St. Augustine, in his disputations against the Donatists. And should we desire Scriptural proof also, let us
listen to these words of the Apostle: I have planted; Apollo watered; but God gave the increase Therefore
neither he that planteth nor he that watereth is any

thing, but God who giveth the increase. From these words it is clear that as trees are not injured by the
wickedness of those who planted them, so those who were planted in Christ by the ministry of bad men sustain
no injury from the guilt of those others.

Judas Iscariot, as the holy Fathers infer from the Gospel of St. John, conferred Baptism on many; and yet none
of those whom he baptised are recorded to have been baptised again. To use the memorable words of St.
Augustine: Judas baptised, and yet after him none were rebaptised; John baptised, and after John they were
rebaptised . For the Baptism administered by Judas was the Baptism of Christ, but that administered by John
was the baptism of John. Not that we prefer Judas to John, but that we justly prefer the Baptism of Christ,
although administered by Judas, to that of John although administered by the hands of John.




Lawfulness Of Administration

But let not pastors, or other ministers of the Sacraments, hence infer that they fully acquit themselves of their
duty, if, disregarding integrity of life and purity of morals, they attend only to the administration of the
Sacraments in the manner prescribed. True, the manner of administering them demands particular diligence; yet
this alone does not constitute all that pertains to that duty. It should never be forgotten that the Sacraments,
although they cannot lose the divine efficacy inherent in them, bring eternal death and perdition to him who
dares administer them unworthily.

Holy things, it cannot be too often repeated, should be treated holily and with due reverence. To the sinner, says
the Prophet, God has said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth, seeing that
thou hast hated discipline? If then, for him who is defiled by sin it is unlawful to speak on divine things, how
enormous the guilt of that man, who, conscious of many crimes, dreads not to accomplish with polluted lips the
holy mysteries, to take them into his befouled hands, to touch

them, and to present and administer them to others? All the more since St. Denis says that the wicked may not
even touch the symbols, as he calls the Sacraments.




                                                       107
It therefore becomes the first duty of the minister of holy things to follow holiness of life, to approach with
purity the administration of the Sacraments, and so to exercise himself in piety, that, from their frequent
administration and use, he may every day receive, with the divine assistance, more abundant grace.




Effects of the Sacraments

When these matters have been explained, the effects of the Sacraments are the next subject of instruction. This
subject should throw considerable light on the definition of a Sacrament as already given.




First Effect: Justifying Grace

The principal effects of the Sacraments are two. The first place is rightly held by that grace which we, following
the usage of the holy Doctors, call sanctifying. For so the Apostle most clearly taught when he said: Christ
loved the church, and delivered himself up for it; that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in
the word of life. But how so great and so admirable an effect is produced by the Sacrament that, to use the well-
known saying of St. Augustine, water cleanses the body and reaches the heart, -- this, indeed, cannot be
comprehended by human reason and intelligence. It may be taken for granted that no sensible thing is of its own
nature able to reach the soul; but we know by the light of faith that in the Sacraments there exists the power of
almighty God by which they effect that which the natural elements cannot of themselves accomplish.

Lest on this subject any doubt should exist in the minds of the faithful, God, in the abundance of His mercy, was
pleased,

from the moment when the Sacraments began to be administered, to manifest by the evidence of miracles the
effects which they operate interiorly in the soul. (This He did) in order that we may most firmly believe that the
same effects, although far removed from the senses, are always inwardly produced. To say nothing of the fact
that at the Baptism of the Redeemer in the Jordan the heavens were opened and the Holy Ghost appeared in the
form of a dove, to teach us that when we are washed in the sacred font His grace is infused into our souls -- to
omit this, which has reference rather to the signification of Baptism than to the administration of the Sacrament
-- do we not read that on the day of Pentecost, when the Apostles received the Holy Ghost, by whom they were
thenceforward inspired with greater alacrity and resolution to preach the faith and brave dangers for the glory of
Christ, there came suddenly a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house
where they were sitting, and there appeared to them parted tongues, as it were, of fire? By this it was understood
that in the Sacrament of Confirmation the same Spirit is given us, and such strength is imparted as enables us
resolutely to encounter and resist our incessant enemies, the world, the flesh and the devil. For some time in the
beginning of the Church, whenever these Sacraments were administered by the Apostles, the same miraculous
effects were witnessed, and they ceased only when the faith had acquired maturity and strength.

From what has been said of sanctifying grace, the first effect of the Sacraments, it clearly follows that there
resides in the Sacraments of the New Law, a virtue more exalted and efficacious than that of the sacraments of
the Old Law. Those ancient sacraments, being weak and needy elements, sanctified such as were defiled to the
cleansing of the flesh, but not of the spirit. They were, therefore, instituted only as signs of those things, which
were to be accomplished by our mysteries. The Sacraments of the New Law, on the contrary, flowing from the
side of Christ, who, by the Holy Ghost, offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our consciences from dead
works, to

serve the living God, and thus work in us, through the blood of Christ, the grace which they signify. Comparing
our Sacraments, therefore, with those of the Old Law we find that they are not only more efficacious, but also
more fruitful in spiritual advantages, and more august in holiness.



                                                        108
Second Effect: Sacramental Character

The second effect of the Sacraments -- which, however, is not common to all, but peculiar to three, Baptism,
Confirmation, and Holy Orders -- is the character which they impress on the soul. When the Apostle says: God
hath anointed us, who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts, he not obscurely
describes by the word sealed a character, the property of which is to impress a seal and mark.

This character is, as it were, a distinctive impression stamped on the soul which perpetually inheres and cannot
be blotted out. Of this St. Augustine says: Shall the Christian Sacraments accomplish less than the bodily mark
impressed on the soldier? That mark is not stamped on his person anew as often as he resumes the military
service which he had relinquished, but the old is recognised and approved.

This character has a twofold effect: it qualifies us to receive or perform something sacred, and distinguishes us
by some mark one from another. In the character impressed by Baptism, both effects are exemplified. By it we
are qualified to receive the other Sacraments, and the Christian is distinguished from those who do not profess
the faith. The same illustration is afforded by the characters impressed by Confirmation and Holy Orders. By
Confirmation we are armed and arrayed as soldiers of Christ, publicly to profess and defend His name, to fight
against our internal enemy and against the spiritual powers of wickedness in the high places; and at the same
time we are distinguished from those who, being recently baptised, are, as it were, new-born infants. Holy
Orders confers the power of consecrating and administering the Sacraments, and also distinguishes those who
are invested

with this power from the rest of the faithful. The rule of the Catholic Church is, therefore, to be observed, which
teaches that these three Sacraments impress a character and are never to be repeated.




How to Make Instruction on the Sacraments Profitable

On the subject of the Sacraments in general, the above are the matters on which instruction should be given. In
explaining them, pastors should keep in view principally two things, which they should zealously strive to
accomplish. The first is that the faithful understand the high honour, respect and veneration due to these divine
and celestial gifts. The second is that, since the Sacraments have been established by the God of infinite mercy
for the common salvation of all, the people should make pious and religious use of them, and be so inflamed
with the desire of Christian perfection as to deem it a very great loss to be for any time deprived of the salutary
use, particularly of Penance and the Holy Eucharist.

These objects pastors will find little difficulty in accomplishing, if they call frequently to the attention of the
faithful what we have already said on the divine character and fruit of the Sacraments: first, that they were
instituted by our Lord and Saviour from whom can proceed nothing but what is most perfect; further that when
administered, the most powerful influence of the Holy Ghost is present, pervading the inmost sanctuary of the
soul; next that they possess an admirable and unfailing virtue to cure our spiritual maladies, and communicate to
us the inexhaustible riches of the Passion of our Lord.

Finally, let them point out, that although the whole edifice of Christian piety rests on the most firm foundation
of the cornerstone; yet, unless it be supported on every side by the preaching of the divine Word and by the use
of the Sacraments, it is greatly to be feared that it may to a great extent totter and fall to the ground. For as we
are ushered into spiritual life by means of the Sacraments, so by the same means are we nourished and
preserved, and grow to spiritual increase.




                                                        109
                                      THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM




Importance Of Instruction On Baptism

From what has been hitherto said on the Sacraments in general, we may judge how necessary it is, to a proper
understanding of the doctrines of the Christian faith and to the practice of Christian piety, to know what the
Catholic Church proposes for our belief on each Sacrament in particular.

Whoever reads the Apostle carefully will unhesitatingly conclude that a perfect knowledge of Baptism is
particularly necessary to the faithful. For not only frequently, but also in language the most energetic, in
language full of the Spirit of God, he renews the recollection of this mystery, declares its divine character, and
in it places before us the death, burial and Resurrection of. our Lord as objects both of our contemplation and
imitation.

Pastors, therefore, can never think that they have bestowed sufficient labor and attention on the exposition of
this Sacrament. Besides the Vigils of Easter and Pentecost, days on which the Church used to celebrate this
Sacrament with the greatest devotion and special solemnity, and on which particularly, according to ancient
practice, its divine mysteries were to be explained, pastors should also take occasion at other times to make it
the subject of their instructions.

For this purpose a most convenient opportunity would seem to present itself whenever a pastor, being about to
administer this Sacrament, finds himself surrounded by a considerable number of the faithful. On such
occasions, it is true, his exposition cannot embrace everything that regards Baptism; but it will then be much
easier to develop one or two points when the faithful

can contemplate with a pious and attentive mind the meaning of those things which they hear and at the same
time see it illustrated by the sacred ceremonies of Baptism. Each person, reading a lesson of admonition in the
person of him who is receiving Baptism, will call to mind the promises by which he bound himself to God when
he was baptised, and will reflect whether his life and conduct have been such as are promised by the profession
of Christianity.




Names of this Sacrament

In order that the treatment of the subject. may be clear, we must explain the nature and substance of Baptism,
premising, however, an explanation of the word itself.

The word baptism, as is well known, is of Greek derivation. Although used in Sacred Scripture to express not
only that ablution which forms part of the Sacrament, but also every species of ablution, and sometimes,
figuratively, to express sufferings; yet it is employed by ecclesiastical writers to designate not every sort of
bodily ablution, but that which forms part of the Sacrament and is administered with the prescribed form of
words. In this sense the Apostles very frequently make use of the word in accordance with the institution of
Christ the Lord.

This Sacrament the holy Fathers designate also by other names. St. Augustine informs us that it was sometimes
called the Sacrament of Faith, because by receiving it we profess our faith in all the doctrines of Christianity.

By others it was termed Illumination, because by the faith which we profess in Baptism the heart is illumined;
for as the Apostle also says, alluding to the time of Baptism, Call to mind the former days, wherein, being
illumined, you endured a great fight of afflictions Chrysostom, in his sermon to the baptised, calls it a purgation,



                                                       110
because through it we purge away the old leaven, that we may become a new paste. He also calls it a burial, a
planting, and the cross of Christ, the reasons for all which appellations may be gathered from the Epistle to the
Romans.

St. Denis calls it the beginning of the most holy Commandments, for this obvious reason, that Baptism is, as it
were, the gate through which we enter into the fellowship of the Christian life, and begin thenceforward to obey
the Commandments. So much should be briefly explained concerning the name (of this Sacrament) .




Definition Of Baptism

With regard to the definition of Baptism although many can be given from sacred writers, nevertheless that
which may be gathered from the words of our Lord recorded in John, and of the Apostle to the Ephesians,
appears the most appropriate and suitable. Unless, says our Lord, a man be born again of water and the Holy
Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God; and, speaking of the Church, the Apostle says, cleansing it by
the laver of water in the word of life. Thus it follows that Baptism may be rightly and accurately defined: The
Sacrament of regeneration by water in the word. By nature we are born from Adam children of wrath, but by
Baptism we are regenerated in Christ, children of mercy. For He gave power to men to be made the sons of
God, to them that believe in his name, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God.




Constituent Elements Of Baptism

But define Baptism as we may, the faithful are to be informed that this Sacrament consists of ablution,
accompanied necessarily, according to the institution of our Lord, by certain solemn words. This is the uniform
doctrine of the holy Fathers, as is proved by the following most explicit testimony of St. Augustine: The word is
joined to the element, and it becomes a Sacrament.

It is all the more necessary to impress this on the minds of the faithful lest they fall into the common error of
thinking that the baptismal water, preserved in the sacred font, constitutes the Sacrament. The Sacrament of
Baptism can be said to exist only when we actually apply the water to someone by way of ablution, while using
the words appointed by our Lord.




Matter of Baptism

Now since we said above, when treating of the Sacraments in general, that every Sacrament consists of matter
and form, it is therefore necessary that pastors point out what constitutes each of these in Baptism. The matter,
then, or element of this Sacrament, is any sort of natural water, which is simply and without qualification
commonly called water, be it sea water, river water, water from a pond, well or fountain.




Testimony Of Scripture Concerning The Matter Of Baptism

For the Saviour taught that unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God. The Apostle also says that the Church was cleansed by the laver of water; and in the Epistle of
St. John we read these words: There are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the
blood. Scripture affords other proofs which establish the same truth.


                                                        111
When, however, John the Baptist says that the Lord will come who will baptise in the Holy Ghost, and in fire,
that is by no means to be understood of the matter of Baptism; but should be applied either to the interior
operation of the Holy Ghost, or at least to the miracle performed on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost
descended on the Apostles in the form of fire, as was foretold by Christ our Lord in these words: John indeed
baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.




Figures

The same was also signified by the Lord both by figures and by prophecies, as we know from Holy Scripture.
According to the Prince of the Apostles in his first Epistle, the deluge which cleansed the world because the
wickedness of men was great on the earth, and all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil, was a figure and
image of this water. To omit the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian, and the admirable virtue of the pool of
Bethsaida, and many similar types, manifestly symbolic of this mystery, the passage through the Red Sea,
according to St. Paul in his Epistle to the Corinthians, was typical of this same water.




Prophecies

With regard to the predictions, the waters to which the Prophet Isaias so freely invites all that thirst, and those
which Ezechiel in spirit saw issuing from the Temple, and also the fountain which Zachary foresaw, open to the
house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the sinner, and of the unclean woman,
were, no doubt, intended to indicate and express the salutary waters of Baptism.




Fitness

The propriety of constituting water the matter of Baptism, of the nature and efficacy of which it is at once
expressive, St. Jerome, in his Epistle to Oceanus, proves by many arguments.

Upon this subject pastors can teach in the first place that water, which is always at hand and within the reach of
all, was the fittest matter of a Sacrament which is necessary to all for salvation. In the next place water is best
adapted to signify the effect of Baptism. It washes away uncleanness, and is, therefore, strikingly illustrative of
the virtue and efficacy of Baptism, which washes away the stains of sin. We may also add that, like water which
cools the body, Baptism in a great measure extinguishes the fire of concupiscence.




Chrism Added To Water For Solemn Baptism

But it should be noted that while in case of necessity simple water unmixed with any other ingredient is
sufficient for the matter of this Sacrament, yet when Baptism is administered in public with solemn ceremonies
the Catholic Church, guided by Apostolic tradition, has uniformly observed the practice of adding holy chrism
which, as is clear, more fully signifies the effect of Baptism. The people should also be taught that although it
may sometimes be doubtful whether this or that water be genuine, such as the perfection of the Sacrament
requires, it can never be a subject of doubt that the only matter from which the Sacrament of Baptism can be
formed is natural water.




                                                       112
Form of Baptism

Having carefully explained the matter, which is one of the two parts of which Baptism consists, pastors must
show equal diligence in explaining the form, which is the other essential part. In the explanation of this
Sacrament a necessity of increased care and study arises, as pastors will perceive, from the circumstance that
the knowledge of so holy a mystery is not only in itself a source of pleasure to the faithful, as is generally the
case with regard to religious knowledge, but also very desirable for almost daily practical use. As we shall
explain in its proper place, circumstances often arise where Baptism requires to be administered by the laity,
and most frequently by women; and it therefore becomes necessary to make all the faithful, indiscriminately,
well acquainted with whatever regards the substance of this Sacrament.




Words Of The Form

Pastors, therefore, should teach, in clear, unambiguous language, intelligible to every capacity, that the true and
essential form of Baptism is: I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. For
so it was delivered by our Lord and Saviour when, as we read in St. Matthew He gave to His Apostles the
command: Going, . . . teach ye all nations: baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.

By the word baptising, the Catholic Church, instructed from above, most justly understood that the form of the
Sacrament should express the action of the minister; and this takes place when he pronounces the words, I
baptise thee.

Besides the minister of the Sacrament, the person to be baptised and the principal efficient cause of Baptism
should be mentioned. The pronoun thee, and the distinctive names of the Divine Persons are therefore added.
Thus the complete form of the Sacrament is expressed in the words already mentioned: I baptise thee in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Baptism is the work not of the Son alone, of whom St. John says, He it is that baptizeth, but of the Three
Persons of the Blessed Trinity together. By saying, however, in the name, not in the names, we distinctly
declare that in the Trinity there is but one Nature and Godhead. The word name is here referred not to the
Persons, but to the Divine Essence, virtue and power, which are one and the same in Three Persons.




Essential And Non-Essential Words Of The Form

It is, however, to be observed that of the words contained in this form, which we have shown to be the complete
and perfect one, some are absolutely necessary, so that the omission of them renders the valid administration of
the Sacrament impossible; while others on the contrary, are not so essential as to affect its validity.

Of the latter kind is the word ego (I), the force of which is included in the word baptizo (I baptise). Nay more,
the Greek Church, adopting a different manner of expressing the form, and being of opinion that it is
unnecessary to make mention of the minister, omits the pronoun altogether. The form universally used in the
Greek Church is: Let this servant of Christ be baptised in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. It appears, however, from the decision and definition of the Council of Florence, that those who
use this form administer the Sacraments validly, because the words sufficiently express what is essential to the
validity of Baptism, that is, the ablution which then takes place.




                                                        113
Baptism In The Name Of Christ

If at any time the Apostles baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ only, we can be sure they did so by the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, in order, in the infancy of the Church, to render their preaching more illustrious
by the name of Jesus Christ, and to proclaim more effectually His divine and infinite power. If, however, we
examine the matter more closely, we shall find that such a form omits nothing which the Saviour Himself
commands to be observed; for he who mentions Jesus Christ implies the Person of the Father, by whom, and
that of the Holy Ghost, in whom, He was anointed.

And yet, the use of this form by the Apostles seems rather doubtful if we accept the opinions of Ambrose and
Basil, holy Fathers eminent for sanctity and authority, who interpret baptism in the name of Jesus Christ to
mean the Baptism instituted by Christ our Lord, as distinguished from that of John, and who say that the
Apostles did not depart from the ordinary and usual form which comprises the distinct names of the Three
Persons. Paul also, in his Epistle to the Galatians, seems to have expressed himself in a similar manner, when he
says: As many of you as have been baptised in Christ, have put on Christ, meaning that they were baptised in
the faith of Christ, but with no other form than that which the same Saviour our Lord had commanded to be
observed.




Administration of Baptism

What has been said on the matter and form, which are required for the essence of the Sacrament, will be found
sufficient for the instruction of the faithful; but as in the administration of the Sacrament the legitimate manner
of ablution should also be observed, pastors should teach the doctrine of this-point also.

They should briefly explain that, according to the common custom and practice of the Church, Baptism may be
administered in three ways, -- by immersion, infusion or aspersion.

Whichever of these rites be observed, we must believe that Baptism is rightly administered. For in Baptism
water is used to signify the spiritual ablution which it accomplishes, and on this account Baptism is called by
the Apostle a laver. Now this ablution is not more really accomplished by immersion, which was for a
considerable time the practice in the early ages of the Church, than by infusion, which we now see in general
use, or by aspersion, which there is reason to believe was the manner in which Peter baptised, when on one day
he converted and gave Baptism to about three thousand souls.

It is a matter of indifference whether the ablution be performed once or thrice. For it is evident from the Epistle
of St. Gregory the Great to Leander that Baptism was formerly and may still be validly administered in the
Church in either way. The faithful, however, should follow the practice of the particular Church to which they
belong.

Pastors should be particularly careful to observe that the baptismal ablution is not to be applied indifferently to
any part of the body, but principally to the head, which is the seat of all the internal and external senses; and
also that he who baptises is to pronounce the sacramental words which constitute the form, not before or after,
but when performing the ablution.




Institution Of Baptism

When these things have been explained, it will also be expedient to teach and remind the faithful that, in
common with the other Sacraments, Baptism was instituted by Christ the Lord. On this subject the pastor should




                                                        114
frequently teach and point out that there are two different periods of time which relate to Baptism, -- one the
period of its institution by the Redeemer; the other, the establishment of the law regarding its reception.




Baptism Instituted At Christ's Baptism

With regard to the former, it is clear that this Sacrament was instituted by our Lord when, having been baptised
by John, He gave to water the power of sanctifying. St. Gregory Nazianzen and St. Augustine · testify that to
water was then. imparted the power of regenerating to spiritual life. In another place St. Augustine says: From
the moment that Christ is immersed in water, water washes away all sins. And again: The Lord is baptised, not
because He had need to be cleansed, but in order that, by the contact of His pure flesh, He might purify the
waters and impart to them the power of cleansing.

A very strong argument to prove that Baptism was then instituted by our Lord might be afforded by the fact the
most Holy Trinity, in whose name Baptism is conferred, manifested Its divine presence on that occasion. The
voice of the Father was heard, the Person of the Son was present, the Holy Ghost descended in the form of a
dove; and the heavens, into which we are enabled to enter by Baptism, were thrown open.

Should anyone desire to know how our Lord has endowed water with a virtue so great, so divine, this indeed
transcends the power of the human understanding. Yet this we can know, that when our Lord was baptised,
water, by contact with His most holy and pure body, was consecrated to the salutary use of Baptism, in such a
way, however, that, although instituted before the Passion, we must believe that this Sacrament derives all its
virtue and efficacy from the Passion, which is the consummation, as it were, of all the actions of Christ.




Baptism Made Obligatory After Christ's Resurrection

The second period to be distinguished, that is, the time when the law of Baptism was made, also admits of no
doubt. Holy writers are unanimous in saying that after the Resurrection of our Lord, when He gave to His
Apostles the command to go and teach all nations: baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost, the law of Baptism became obligatory on all who were to be saved.

This is inferred from the authority of the Prince of the Apostles when he says: Who hath regenerated us into a
lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead;' and also from what Paul says of the Church: He
delivered himself up for it: that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life. By
both Apostles the obligation of Baptism seems to be referred to the time which followed the death of our Lord.
Hence we can have no doubt that the words of the Saviour: Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy
Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, refer also to the same time which was to follow after His
Passion.




Reflection

If, then, pastors explain these truths accurately, there can be no doubt that the faithful will recognise the high
dignity of this Sacrament and venerate it with the most profound piety, particularly when they reflect that each
of them receives in Baptism by the interior operation of the Holy Ghost the same glorious and most ample gifts
which were so strikingly manifested by miracles at the Baptism of Christ the Lord.

Were our eyes, like those of the servant of Eliseus, opened to see heavenly things, who can be supposed so
senseless as not to be lost in rapturous admiration of the divine mysteries of Baptism ! When, therefore, the



                                                       115
riches of this Sacrament are unfolded to the faithful by the pastor, so as to enable them to behold them, if not
with the eyes of the body, yet with those of the soul illumined by the light of faith, may we not anticipate
similar results ?




The Ministers of Baptism

In the next place, it appears not only expedient, but necessary to say who are ministers of this Sacrament; both
in order that those to whom this office is specially confided may study to perform its functions religiously and
holily; and that no one, outstepping, as it were, his proper limits, may unseasonably take possession of, or
arrogantly assume, what belongs to another; for, as the Apostle teaches, order is to be observed in all things.




Bishops And Priests The Ordinary Ministers

The faithful, therefore, are to be informed that of those (who administer Baptism) there are three gradations.
Bishops and priests hold the first place. To them belongs the administration of this Sacrament, not by any
extraordinary concession of power, but by right of office; for to them, in the persons of the Apostles, was
addressed the command of our Lord: Go, baptise. Bishops, it is true, in order not to neglect the more weighty
charge of instructing the faithful, have generally left its administration to priests. But the authority of the
Fathers and the usage of the Church prove that priests exercise this function by their own right, so much so that
they may baptise even in the presence of the Bishop. Ordained to consecrate the Holy Eucharist, the Sacrament
of peace and unity, it was fitting that they be invested with power to administer all those things which are
required to enable others to participate in that peace and unity. If, therefore, the Fathers have at any time said
that without the leave of the Bishop the priest has not the right to baptise, they are to be understood to speak of
that Baptism only which was administered on certain days of the year with solemn ceremonies.




Deacons Extraordinary Ministers Of Baptism

Next among the ministers are deacons, for whom, as numerous decrees of the holy Fathers attest it is not lawful
without the permission of the Bishop or priest to administer this Sacrament.




Ministers In Case Of Necessity

Those who may administer Baptism in case of necessity, but without its solemn ceremonies, hold the last place;
and in this class are included all, even the laity, men and women, to whatever sect they may belong. This office
extends in case of necessity, even to Jews, infidels and heretics, provided, however, they intend to do what the
Catholic Church does in that act of her ministry. These things were established by many decrees of the ancient
Fathers and Councils; and the holy Council of Trent denounces anathema against those who dare to say, that
Baptism, even when administered by heretics, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
with the intention of doing what the Church does, is not true Baptism.

And here indeed let us admire the supreme goodness and wisdom of our Lord. Seeing the necessity of this
Sacrament for all, He not only instituted water, than which nothing can be more common, as its matter, but also
placed its administration within the power of all. In its administration, however, as we have already observed,
all are not allowed to use the solemn ceremonies; not that rites and ceremonies are of higher dignity, but
because they are less necessary than the Sacrament.



                                                       116
Let not the faithful, however, imagine that this office is given promiscuously to all, so as to do away with the
propriety of observing a certain precedence among those who are its ministers. When a man is present a woman
should not baptise; an ecclesiastic takes precedence over a layman, and a priest over a simple ecclesiastic.
Midwives, however, when accustomed to its administration, are not to be found fault with if sometimes, when a
man is present who is unacquainted with the manner of its administration, they perform what may otherwise
appear to belong more properly to men.




The Sponsors at Baptism

Besides the ministers who, as just explained, confer Baptism, another class of persons, according to the most
ancient practice of the Church, is admitted to assist at the baptismal font. In former times these were commonly
called by sacred writers receivers, sponsors or sureties, and are now called godfathers and godmothers. As this
is an office pertaining almost to all the laity, pastors should explain it with care, so that the faithful may
understand what is chiefly necessary for its proper performance.




Why Sponsors Are Required At Baptism

In the first instance it should be explained why at Baptism, besides those who administer the Sacrament,
godparents and sponsors are also required. The propriety of the practice will at once appear to all if they
recollect that Baptism is a spiritual regeneration by which we are born children of God; for of it St. Peter says:
As newborn infants, desire the rational milk without guile. As, therefore, every one, after his birth, requires a
nurse and instructor by whose assistance and attention he is brought up and formed to learning and useful
knowledge, so those, who, by the waters of Baptism, begin to live a spiritual life should be entrusted to the
fidelity and prudence of some one from whom they may imbibe the precepts of the Christian religion and may
be brought up in all holiness, and thus grow gradually in Christ, until, with the Lord's help, they at length arrive
at perfect manhood.

This necessity must appear still more imperative, if we recollect that pastors, who are charged with the public
care of parishes have not sufficient time to undertake the private instruction of children in the rudiments of
faith.




Antiquity Of This Law

Concerning this very ancient practice we have this noteworthy testimony of St. Denis: It occurred to our divine
leaders (so he called the Apostles), and they in their wisdom ordained that infants should be introduced (into the
Church) in this holy manner that their natural parents should deliver them to the care of some one well skilled in
divine things, as to a master under whom, as a spiritual father and guardian of his salvation in holiness, the child
should lead the remainder of his life. The same doctrine is confirmed by the authority of Hyginus.




Affinity Contracted By Sponsors

The Church, therefore, in her wisdom has ordained that not only the person who baptises contracts a spiritual
affinity with the person baptised, but also the sponsor with the godchild and its natural parents, so that between
all these marriage cannot be lawfully contracted, and if contracted, it is null and void.




                                                        117
Duties Of Sponsors

The faithful are also to be taught the duty of sponsors; for such is the negligence with which this office is
treated in the Church that only the bare name of the function remains, while none seem to have the least idea of
its sanctity. Let all sponsors, then, at all times recollect that they are strictly bound by this law to exercise a
constant vigilance over their spiritual children, and carefully to instruct them in the maxims of a Christian life;
so that these may show themselves throughout life to be what their sponsors promised in the solemn ceremony.

On this subject let us hear the words of St. Denis. Speaking in the person of the sponsor he says: I promise, by
my constant exhortations to induce this child, when he comes to a knowledge of religion, to renounce every
thing opposed (to his Christian calling) and to profess and perform the sacred promises which he now makes.

St. Augustine also says: I most especially admonish you, men and women, who have acquired godchildren
through Baptism, to consider that you stood as sureties before God, for those whom you received at the sacred
font. Indeed it preeminently becomes every man, who undertakes any office, to be indefatigable in the discharge
of its duties; and he who promised to be the teacher and guardian of another should never allow to be deserted
him whom he once received under his care and protection as long as he knows the latter to stand in need of
either.

Speaking of this same duty of sponsors, St. Augustine sums up in a few words the lessons of instruction which
they are bound to impart to their spiritual children. They ought, he says, to admonish them to observe chastity,
love justice, cling to charity; and above all they should teach them the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten
Commandments, and the rudiments of the Christian religion.




Who May Not Be Sponsors

It is easy, therefore, to decide who are inadmissible to this holy guardianship, that is, those who are unwilling to
discharge its duties with fidelity, or who cannot do so with care and accuracy.

Wherefore, besides the natural parents, who, to mark the great difference that exists between this spiritual and
the carnal bringing up of youth, are not permitted to undertake this charge, heretics, Jews and infidels are on no
account to be admitted to this office, since their thoughts and efforts are continually employed in darkening by
falsehood the true faith and in subverting all Christian piety.




Number Of Sponsors

The number of sponsors is limited by the Council of Trent to one godfather or one godmother, or at most, to a
godfather and a godmother; because a number of teachers may confuse the order of discipline and instruction,
and also because it was necessary to prevent the multiplication of affinities which would impede a wider
diffusion of society by means of lawful marriage.




Necessity of Baptism

If the knowledge of what has been hitherto explained be, as it is, of highest importance to the faithful, it is no
less important to them to learn that the law of Baptism, as established by our Lord, extends to all, so that unless


                                                        118
they are regenerated to God through the grace of Baptism, be their parents Christians or infidels, they are born
to eternal misery and destruction. Pastors, therefore, should often explain these words of the Gospel: Unless a
man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.




Infant Baptism: It's Necessity

That this law extends not only to adults but also to infants and children, and that the Church has received this
from Apostolic tradition, is confirmed by the unanimous teaching and authority of the Fathers.

Besides, it is not to be supposed that Christ the Lord would have withheld the Sacrament and grace of Baptism
from children, of whom He said: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me; for the kingdom
of heaven is for such; ° whom also He embraced, upon whom He imposed hands, to whom He gave His
blessing.

Moreover, when we read that an entire family was baptised by Paul, it is sufficiently obvious that the children
of the family must also have been cleansed in the saving font.

Circumcision, too, which was a figure of Baptism, affords strong argument in proof of this practice. That
children were circumcised on the eighth day is universally known. If then circumcision, made by hand, in
despoiling of the body of the flesh, was profitable to children, it is clear that Baptism, which is the circumcision
of Christ, not made by hand, is also profitable to them.

Finally, as the Apostle teaches, if by one man's offence death reigned through one, much more they who receive
abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ. If, then, through
the transgression of Adam, children inherit original sin, with still stronger reason can they attain through Christ
our Lord grace and justice that they may reign in life. This, however, cannot be effected otherwise than by
Baptism.

Pastors, therefore, should inculcate the absolute necessity of ad- ministering Baptism to infants, and of
gradually forming their tender minds to piety by education in the Christian religion. For according to these
admirable words of the wise man: A young man according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart
from it.




Infants Receive The Graces Of Baptism

It may not be doubted that in Baptism infants receive the mysterious gifts of faith. Not that they believe with the
assent of the mind, but they are established in the faith of their parents, if the parents profess the true faith; if
not--to use the words of St. Augustine,--then in that of the universal society of the saints; for they are rightly
said to be presented for Baptism by all those to whom their initiation in that sacred rite is a source of joy, and by
whose charity they are united to the communion of the Holy Ghost.




Baptism Of Infants Should Not Be Delayed

The faithful are earnestly to be exhorted to take care that their children be brought to the church, as soon as it
can be done with safety, to receive solemn Baptism. Since infant children have no other means of salvation
except Baptism, we may easily understand how grievously those persons sin who permit them to remain




                                                        119
without the grace of the Sacrament longer than necessity may require, particularly at an age so tender as to be
exposed to numberless dangers of death.




Baptism Of Adults

With regard to those of adult age who enjoy the perfect use of reason, persons, namely, born of infidel parents,
the practice of the primitive Church points out that a different manner of proceeding should be followed. To
them the Christian faith is to be proposed; and they are earnestly to be exhorted, persuaded and invited to
embrace it.




They Should Not Delay Their Baptism Unduly

If converted to the Lord God, they are then to be admonished not to defer the Sacrament of Baptism beyond the
time prescribed by the Church. For since it is written, delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not
from day to day, they are to be taught that in their regard perfect conversion consists in regeneration by
Baptism. Besides, the longer they defer Baptism, the longer are they deprived of the use and graces of the other
Sacraments, by which the Christian religion is practised, since the other Sacraments are accessible through
Baptism only.

They are also deprived of the abundant fruits of Baptism, the waters of which not only wash away all the stains
and defilements of past sins, but also enrich us with divine grace which enables us to avoid sin for the future
and preserve righteousness and innocence, which constitute the sum of a Christian life, as all can easily
understand.




Ordinarily They Are Not Baptised At Once

On adults, however, the Church has not been accustomed to confer the Sacrament of Baptism at once, but has
ordained that it be deferred for a certain time. The delay is not attended with the same danger as in the case of
infants, which we have already mentioned; should any unforeseen accident make it impossible for adults to be
washed in the salutary waters, their intention and determination to receive Baptism and their repentance for past
sins, will avail them to grace and righteousness.

Nay, this delay seems to be attended with some advantages. And first, since the Church must take particular
care that none approach this Sacrament through hypocrisy and dissimulation, the intentions of such as seek
Baptism, are better examined and ascertained. Hence it is that we read in the decrees of ancient Councils that
Jewish converts to the Catholic faith, before admission to Baptism, should spend some months in the ranks of
the catechumens.

Furthermore, the candidate for Baptism is thus better instructed in the doctrine of the faith which he is to
profess, and in the practices of the Christian life. Finally, when Baptism is administered to adults with solemn
ceremonies on the appointed days of Easter and Pentecost only greater religious reverence is shown to the
Sacrament.




In Case Of Necessity Adults May Be: Baptised At Once




                                                       120
Sometimes, however, when there exists a just and necessary cause, as in the case of imminent danger of death,
Baptism is not to be deferred, particularly if the person to be baptised is well instructed in the mysteries of faith.
This we find to have been done by Philip, and by the Prince of the Apostles, when without any delay, the one
baptised the eunuch of Queen Candace; the other, Cornelius, as soon as they expressed a wish to embrace the
faith.




Dispositions for Baptism




Intention

The faithful are also to be instructed in the necessary dispositions for Baptism. In the first place they must desire
and intend to receive it; for as in Baptism we all die to sin and resolve to live a new life, it is fit that it be
administered to those only who receive it of their own free will and accord; it is to be forced upon none. Hence
we learn from holy tradition that it has been the invariable practice to administer Baptism to no individual
without previously asking him if he be willing to receive it. This disposition even infants are presumed to have,
since the will of the Church, which promises for them, cannot be mistaken.

Insane, delirious persons who were once of sound mind and afterwards became deranged, having in their
present state no wish to be baptised, are not to be admitted to Baptism, unless in danger of death. In such cases,
if previous to insanity they give intimation of a wish to be baptised, the Sacrament is to be administered;
without such indication previously given it is not to be administered. The same rule is to be followed with
regard to persons who are unconscious.

But if they (the insane) never enjoyed the use of reason, the authority and practice of the Church decide that
they are to be baptised in the faith of the Church, just as children are baptised before they come to the use of
reason.




Faith

Besides a wish to be baptised, in order to obtain the grace of the Sacrament, faith is also necessary. Our Lord
and Saviour has said: He that believes and is baptised shall be saved.




Repentance

Another necessary condition is repentance for past sins, and a fixed determination to avoid all sin in the future.
Should anyone desire Baptism and be unwilling to correct the habit of sinning, he should be altogether rejected.
For nothing is so opposed to the grace and power of Baptism as the intention and purpose of those who resolve
never to abandon sin.

Seeing that Baptism should be sought with a view to put on Christ and to be united to Him, it is manifest that he
who purposes to continue in sin should justly be repelled from the sacred font, particularly since none of those
things which belong to Christ and His Church are to be received in vain, and since we well understand that, as
far as regards sanctifying and saving grace, Baptism is received in vain by him who purposes to live according
to the flesh, and not according to the spirit. As far, however, as the Sacrament is concerned, if the person who is




                                                         121
rightly baptised intends to receive what the Church administers, he without doubt validly receives the
Sacrament.

Hence, to the vast multitude who, in compunction of heart, as the Scripture says, asked him and the other
Apostles what they should do, the Prince of the Apostles answered: Do penance and be baptised every one of
you; and in another place he said: Be penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.
Writing to the Romans, St. Paul also clearly shows that he who is baptised should entirely die to sin; and he
therefore admonishes us not to yield our members as instruments of iniquity unto sin, but present ourselves to
God, as those who are alive from the dead.




Advantages To Be Derived From These Reflections

Frequent reflection upon these truths cannot fail, in the first place, to fill the minds of the faithful with
admiration for the infinite goodness of God, who, uninfluenced by any other consideration than that of His
mercy, gratuitously bestowed upon us, undeserving as we are, a blessing so extraordinary and divine as that of
Baptism.

If in the next place they consider how spotless should be the lives of those who have been made the objects of
such munificence, they cannot fail to be convinced of the special obligation imposed on every Christian to
spend each day of his life in such sanctity and fervour, as if on that very day he had received the Sacrament and
grace of Baptism.




Effects of Baptism

To inflame the minds of the faithful, however, with a zeal for true piety, pastors will find no means more
efficacious than an accurate exposition of the effects of Baptism.

The effects of Baptism should be frequently explained, in order that the faithful may be rendered more sensible
of the high dignity to which they have been raised, and may never suffer themselves to be cast down therefrom
by the snares or assaults of Satan.




First Effect Of Baptism: Remission Of Sin

They are to be taught, in the first place, that such is the admirable efficacy of this Sacrament that it remits
original sin and actual guilt, however unthinkable its enormity may seem.

This was foretold long before by Ezechiel, through whom God said: I will pour upon you clean water, and you
shall be cleansed from all your filthiness. The Apostle also, writing to the Corinthians, after having enumerated
a long catalogue of sins, adds: such you were, but you are washed, but you are sanctified.

That such was at all times the doctrine handed down by holy Church is clear. By the generation of the flesh,
says St. Augustine in his book On the Baptism of Infants, we contract original sin only; by the regeneration of
the Spirit, we obtain forgiveness not only of original, but also of actual sins. St. Jerome also, writing to
Oceanus, says: all sins are forgiven in Baptism.

To remove all further doubt on the subject, the Council of Trent, after other Councils had defined this, declared
it anew, pronouncing anathema against those who should presume to think otherwise, or should dare to assert


                                                        122
that although sin is forgiven in Baptism, it is not entirely removed or totally eradicated, but is cut away in such a
manner as to leave its roots still fixed in the soul. To use the words of the same holy Council, God hates nothing
in those who are regenerated; for there remains nothing deserving of condemnation in those who are truly
buried with Christ by Baptism unto death, "who walk not according to the flesh" but putting off the old man,
and putting on the new, who is created according to God, become innocent, spotless, pure, upright, and beloved
of God.




Concupiscence Which Remains After Baptism Is No Sin

We must confess, however, that concupiscence, or the fuel of sin, still remains, as the Council declares in the
same place. But concupiscence does not constitute sin, for, as St. Augustine observes, in children who have
been baptised the guilt of concupiscence is removed, (the concupiscence itself) remains for probation; and in
another place he says: the guilt of concupiscence is pardoned in Baptism, but its infirmity remains. For
concupiscence which is the effect of sin is nothing more than an appetite of the soul in itself repugnant to
reason. But if it is not accompanied by the consent of the will or by negligence, it is very far from being sin.

When St. Paul says, I did not know concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet, he speaks not of
concupiscence itself, but of the fault of the will.

The same doctrine is taught by St. Gregory when he says: If there are any who assert that in Baptism sin is but
superficially effaced, what could be more untrue than their statement? By the Sacrament of faith the soul,
entirely freed from sin, adheres to God alone. In proof of this doctrine he has recourse to the testimony of our
Saviour who says in St. John: He that is -washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly.




Further Proof Of The First Effect Of Baptism

Should anyone desire a striking figure and image (of the efficacy of Baptism) let him consider the history of
Naaman the Syrian leper, of whom the Scriptures inform us that when he had washed seven times in the waters
of the Jordan he was so cleansed from his leprosy that his flesh became like the flesh of a child.

The remission of all sin, original and actual, is therefore the peculiar effect of Baptism. That this was the object
of its institution by our Lord and Saviour is clearly stated by the Prince of the Apostles, to say nothing of other
testimonies, when he says: Do penance and be baptised every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
remission of sins.




The Second Effect Of Baptism: Remission Of All Punishment Due To Sin

In Baptism not only is sin forgiven, but with it all the punishment due to sin is mercifully remitted by God. To
communicate the efficacy of the Passion of Christ our Lord is an effect common to all the Sacraments; but of
Baptism alone does the Apostle say, that by it we die and are buried together with Christ.

Hence holy Church has always understood that to impose those works of piety, usually called by the holy
Fathers works of satisfaction, on one who is to be cleansed in Baptism, would be injurious to this Sacrament in
the highest degree.

Nor is there any discrepancy between the doctrine here taught and the practice of the primitive Church, which
of old commanded the Jews, when preparing for Baptism, to observe a fast of forty successive days. (The fast


                                                        123
thus imposed) was not enjoined as a work of satisfaction; but those who had received Baptism were thus
admonished to devote some time to the uninterrupted exercise of fasting and prayer in honour of so great a
Sacrament.




Baptism Does Not Exempt From Penalties Of The Civil Law

Although the remission by Baptism of the punishments due to sin cannot be questioned, we are not to infer that
it exempts an offender from the punishments decreed by civil tribunals for some grave crime. Thus a person
sentenced to death is not rescued by Baptism from the penalty ordained by the law.

We cannot, however, too highly commend the religion and piety of those rulers who remit the sentence of the
law, that the glory of God may be the more strikingly displayed in His Sacraments.




Baptism Remits The Punishment Due To Original Sin After Death

Baptism also remits all the punishment due to original sin after this life, for through the merit of the death of our
Lord we are able to attain this blessing. By Baptism, as we have already said, we die with Christ. For if, says the
Apostle, we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
resurrection.




Baptism Does Not Free Us From The Miseries Of Life

Should it be asked why immediately after Baptism we are not exempt in this mortal life from misfortunes and
restored by the influence of this sacred ablution to that state of perfection in which Adam, the father of the
human race, was placed before his fall, the answer will be that there are two chief reasons for this.

In the first place we who by Baptism are united to, and become members of Christ's body, should not be more
honoured than our Head. Now Christ our Lord, although clothed from His birth with the plenitude of grace and
truth, was not divested of human infirmity which He assumed, until, having suffered and died, He rose to the
glory of immortality. It cannot appear extraordinary, therefore, if the faithful, even after they have received the
grace of justification by Baptism, are clothed with frail and perishable bodies until, having undergone many
labours for the sake of Christ, and having closed their earthly career, they are recalled to life and found worthy
to enjoy with Him an eternity of bliss.

The second reason why bodily infirmity, disease, sense of pain and motions of concupiscence remain after
Baptism is that in them we may have the seed and material of virtue from which we shall hereafter receive a
more abundant harvest of glory and more ample rewards. When, with patient resignation, we bear all the trials
of life, and, aided by the divine assistance, subject to the dominion of reason the rebellious desires of the heart,
we ought to cherish an assured hope that if, with the Apostle we shall have fought a good fight, finished the
course, and kept the faith, the Lord, the just judge, will render to us on that day a crown of justice which is laid
up for us.

Such seems to have been the divine plan with regard to the children of Israel. God delivered them from the
bondage of Egypt, having drowned Pharaoh and his hosts in the sea; yet He did not conduct them immediately
into the happy land of promise; He first tried them by a variety and multiplicity of sufferings. And when He
afterwards placed them in possession of the promised land and expelled the previous inhabitants from their




                                                        124
native territories, yet He left a few other nations whom the Israelites could not exterminate, in order that His
people might always have occasion to exercise fortitude and warlike courage.

We may add that if, to the heavenly gifts with which the soul is adorned in Baptism, were joined temporal
advantages, there would be good reason to doubt whether many might not approach Baptism with a view to
obtain such advantages in this life, rather than the glory to be hoped for in the next; whereas the Christian
should always propose to himself, not these delusive and uncertain goods which are seen, but the solid and
eternal ones which are not seen.




Baptism A Source Of Happiness To The Christian Even In This Life

This life, however, although full of misery, does not lack its pleasures and joys. To us, who by Baptism are
engrafted as branches on Christ's what could be more pleasing or desirable than, taking up the cross upon our
shoulders, to follow Him as our leader, fatigued by no labor, retarded by no danger, in ardent pursuit of the
rewards of our high vocation; some to receive the laurel of virginity, others the crown of teaching and
preaching, some the palm of martyrdom, others the honours appropriate to their respective virtues? These
splendid titles of exalted dignity none of us should receive, had we not contended in the race of this calamitous
life and stood unconquered in the conflict.




Third Effect Of Baptism: Grace Of Regeneration

But to return to the effects of Baptism, it should be taught that by virtue of this Sacrament we are not only
delivered from what are justly deemed the greatest of all evils, but are also enriched with invaluable goods and
blessings. Our souls are replenished with divine grace, by which we are rendered just and children of God and
are made heirs to eternal salvation. For it is written: He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved, and the
Apostle testifies that the Church is cleansed by the laver of water in the word of life. Now according to the
definition of the Council of Trent, which under pain of anathema we are bound to believe, grace not only remits
sin, but is also a divine quality inherent in the soul, and, as it were, a brilliant light that effaces all those stains
which obscure the lustre of the soul, investing it with increased brightness and beauty. This is also a clear
inference from the words of Scripture when it says that grace is poured forth, and also when it usually calls
grace, the pledge of the Holy Ghost.




Fourth Effect Of Baptism: Infused Virtues And Incorporation With Christ

This grace is accompanied by a most splendid train of all virtues, which are divinely infused into the soul along
with grace. Hence, when writing to Titus, the Apostle says: He saved us by the laver of regeneration and
renovation of the Holy Ghost, whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our
Saviour. St. Augustine, in explanation of the words, poured forth abundantly, says: that is, for the remission of
sins and for abundance of virtues.

By Baptism we are also united to Christ, as members to their Head. As therefore from the head proceeds the
power by which the different members of the body are moved to the proper performance of their respective
functions, so from the fullness of Christ the Lord are diffused divine grace and virtue through all those who are
justified, qualifying them for the performance of all the duties of Christian piety.




                                                          125
Why The Practice Of Virtue Is Difficult Even After Baptism

Though we are thus supported by a powerful array of virtues, it should not excite our surprise if we cannot,
without much labor and difficulty, undertake, or at least, perform acts of piety and of moral virtue. If this is so,
it is not because the goodness of God has not bestowed on us the virtues from which these good works proceed;
but because there still remains after Baptism a severe conflict of the flesh against the spirit, in which, however,
it would not become a Christian to be dispirited or grow faint.

Relying on the divine goodness we should confidently hope that by a constant habit of leading a holy life the
time will come when whatever things are modest, whatever just, whatever holy, will also prove easy and
agreeable. Let these be the subjects of our willing consideration, the objects of our cheerful practice, that the
God of peace may be with us.




Fifth Effect Of Baptism: Character Of Christian

By Baptism, moreover, we are sealed with a character that can never be effaced from the soul. On this point,
however, we need not speak at length, for what we have already sufficiently said on the subject, when treating
of the Sacraments in general, may be applied here.




Baptism Not To Be Repeated

Since on account of the nature and efficacy of this character it has been defined by the Church that this
Sacrament is on no account to be reiterated, pastors should frequently and diligently admonish the faithful on
this subject, lest at any time they may be led into error.

This doctrine is taught by the Apostle when he says: One Lord, one faith, one baptism. Again, when exhorting
the Romans, that being dead in Christ by Baptism they should take care not to lose the life which they had
received from Him, he says: In that Christ died unto sin, he died once. These words seem clearly to signify that
as Christ cannot die again, neither can we die again by Baptism. Hence the holy Church also openly professes
that she believes one Baptism. That this agrees with the nature of the thing and with reason is understood from
the very idea of Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration. As then, by virtue of the laws of nature, we are
generated and born but once, and, as St. Augustine observes, there is no returning to the womb; so, in like
manner, there is but one spiritual generation, and Baptism is never at any time to be repeated.




In Conditional Baptism The Sacrament Is Not Repeated

Nor let anyone suppose that it is repeated by the Church when she baptises anyone whose previous Baptism was
doubtful, making use of this formula: If thou art baptised, I baptise thee not again but if thou art not yet
baptised, I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. In such cases Baptism
is not to be considered as impiously repeated, but as holily, yet conditionally, administered.

In this connection, however, there are some matters, in which, to the very great injury of the Sacrament, abuses
are of almost daily occurrence, and which therefore demand the diligent attention of pastors. For there are not
wanting those who think that no sin is committed if they indiscriminately administer conditional Baptism.
Hence if an infant be brought to them, they think that no inquiry need be made as to whether it was previously
baptised, but proceed immediately to baptise the child. Nay more, although they be well aware that the




                                                        126
Sacrament was administered at home, they do not hesitate to repeat its administration in the Church
conditionally, making use of the solemn ceremonies of the Church.

This certainly they cannot do without sacrilege and without incurring what theologians call an irregularity.
According to the authority of Pope Alexander the conditional form of Baptism is to be used only when after due
inquiry doubts are entertained as to the validity of the previous Baptism. In no other case is it ever lawful to
administer Baptism a second time, even conditionally.




Sixth Effect Of Baptism: Opening The Gates Of Heaven

Besides the other advantages which accrue to us from Baptism, the last, to which all the others seem to be
referred, is that it opens to us the portals of heaven which sin had closed against us.




Effects Of Baptism Foreshadowed In The Baptism Of Christ

These effects which are wrought in us by virtue of Baptism are distinctly marked by the circumstances which,
as the Gospel relates, accompanied the Baptism of our Saviour. The heavens were opened and the Holy Ghost
appeared descending upon Christ our Lord in the form of a dove. By this we are given to understand that to
those who are baptised are imparted the gifts of the Holy Spirit, that to them are opened the gates of heaven.
The baptised, it is true, do not enter heaven immediately after Baptism, but in due season. When they shall have
been freed from all misery which is incompatible with a state of bliss, they shall exchange a mortal for an
immortal life.




Measure In Which Those Effects Are Obtained

These are the fruits of Baptism, which, if we consider the efficacy of the Sacrament, are, no doubt, equally
common to all; but if we consider the dispositions with which it is received, it is no less certain that all do not
share to the same extent in these heavenly gifts and graces.




Ceremonies of Baptism




Their Importance

It now remains to explain, clearly and concisely, what is to be taught concerning the prayers, rites, and
ceremonies of this Sacrament. To rites and ceremonies may, in some measure, be applied what the Apostle says
of the gift of tongues, that it is unprofitable to speak, unless the faithful understand. They present an image, and
convey the signification of the things that are done in the Sacrament; but if the people do not understand the
force and meaning of these signs, there is but little advantage derived from ceremonies. Pastors should take
care, therefore, to make them understood and to impress the minds of the faithful with a conviction that,
although ceremonies are not of absolute necessity, they are of very great importance and deserve great
veneration.




                                                        127
This the authority of those by whom they were instituted, who were, no doubt, the Apostles, and also the object
of their institution, sufficiently prove. It is manifest that ceremonies contribute to the more religious and holy
administration of the Sacraments, serve to place, as it were, before the eyes the exalted and inestimable gifts
which they contain, and impress on the minds of the faithful a deeper sense of the boundless beneficence of
God.




Three Classes Of Ceremonies In Baptism

In order that the pastor's instructions may follow a certain plan and that the people may find it: easier to
remember his words, all the ceremonies and prayers which the Church uses in the administration of Baptism are
to be reduced to three heads. The first comprehends such as are observed before coming to the baptismal font;
the second, such as are used at the font; the third, those that usually follow the administration of the Sacrament.




Ceremonies That Are Observed Before Coming To The Font: Consecration Of Baptismal Water

In the first place, then, the water to be used in Baptism should be prepared. The baptismal font is consecrated
with the oil of mystic unction; not, however, at all times, but, according to ancient usage, only on certain feasts,
which are justly deemed the greatest and the most holy solemnities in the year. The water of Baptism was
consecrated on the vigils of those feasts; and on those days alone, except in cases of necessity, it was also the
practice of the ancient Church to administer Baptism. But although the Church, on account of the dangers to
which life is continually exposed, has deemed it expedient to change her discipline in this respect, she still
observes with the greatest solemnity the festivals of Easter and Pentecost on which the baptismal water is to be
consecrated.




The Person To Be Baptised Stands At The Church Door

After the consecration of the water the other ceremonies that precede Baptism are next to be explained. The
persons to be baptised are brought or conducted a to the door of the church and are strictly forbidden to enter, as
unworthy to be admitted into the house of God, until they have cast off the yoke of the most degrading servitude
and devoted themselves unreservedly to Christ the Lord and His most just authority.




Catechetical Instruction

The priest then asks what they demand of the Church; and having received the answer, he first instructs them in
the doctrines of the Christian faith, of which a profession is to be made in Baptism.

This the priest does in a brief catechetical instruction, a practice which originated, no doubt, in the precept of
our Lord addressed to His Apostles: Go ye into the whole world, and teach all nations, baptising them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
have commanded you. From this command we may learn that Baptism is not to be administered until, at least,
the principal truths of our religion are explained.

But as the catechetical form consists of many interrogations, if the person to be instructed be an adult, he
himself answers; if an infant, the sponsor answers for him according to the prescribed form and makes the
solemn promise.


                                                        128
The Exorcism

The exorcism comes next in order. It consists of words of sacred and religious import and of prayers, and is
used to expel the devil, to weaken and crush his power.




The Salt

To the exorcism are added other ceremonies, each of which, being mystical, has its own clear signification.
When, for instance, salt is put into the mouth of the person to be baptised, this evidently means that, by the
doctrines of faith and by the gift of grace, he shall be delivered from the corruption of sin, shall experience a
relish for good works, and shall be delighted with the food of divine wisdom.




The Sign Of The Cross

Next his forehead, eyes, breast, shoulders and ears are signed with the sign of the cross, to declare, that by the
mystery of Baptism, the senses of the person baptised are opened and strengthened, to enable him to receive
God, and to understand and observe His Commandments.




The Saliva

His nostrils and ears are next touched with spittle, and he is then immediately admitted to the baptismal font. By
this ceremony we understand that, as sight was given to the blind man mentioned in the Gospel, whom the Lord
after He had spread clay on his eyes commanded to wash them in the waters of Siloe, so through the efficacy of
holy Baptism a light is let in on the mind, which enables it to discern heavenly truth.




The Ceremonies Observed After Coming To The Font

After the performance of these ceremonies the persons to be baptised approach the baptismal font, at which are
performed other rites and ceremonies which present a summary of the Christian religion.




The Renunciation Of Satan

Three distinct times the person to be baptised is asked by the priest: Dost thou renounce Satan, and all his
works, and all his pomps? To each of which he, or the sponsor in his name, replies, I renounce. Whoever, then,
purposes to enlist, under the standard of Christ, must first of all, enter into a sacred and solemn engagement to
renounce the devil and the world, and always to hold them in utter detestation as his worst enemies.




The Profession Of Faith


                                                        129
Next, standing at the baptismal font, he is interrogated by the priest in these words: Dost thou believe in God,
the Father Almighty? To which he answers: I believe. Being similarly questioned on the remaining Articles of
the Creed, he solemnly professes his faith. These two promises contain, it is clear, the sum and substance of the
law of Christ.




The Wish To Be Baptised

When the Sacrament is now about to be administered, the priest asks the candidate if he wishes to be baptised.
After an answer in the affirmative has been given by him, or, if he is an infant, by the sponsor, the priest
immediately performs the salutary ablution, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

As man, by yielding the assent of his will to the wicked suggestions of Satan, fell under a just sentence of
condemnation; so God will have none enrolled in the number of His soldiers but those whose service is
voluntary, that by a willing obedience to His commands they may obtain eternal salvation.




The Ceremonies That Follow Baptism: Chrism

After the person has been baptised, the priest anoints the crown of his head with chrism, thus giving him to
understand, that from that day he is united as a member to Christ, His Head, and ingrafted on His body; and that
he is, therefore, called a Christian from Christ, as Christ is so called from chrism. What the chrism signifies, the
prayers then offered by the priest, as St. Ambrose observes, sufficiently explain.




The White Garment

On the person baptised the priest then puts a white garment saying: Receive this white garment, which mayest
thou carry unstained before the judgment-seat of our Lord Jesus Christ; that thou mayest have eternal life.
Instead of a white garment, infants, because not formally dressed, receive a white cloth, accompanied by the
same words.

According to the teaching of the Fathers this symbol signifies the glory of the resurrection to which we are born
by Baptism, the brightness and beauty with which the soul, when purified from the stains of sin, is invested in
Baptism, and the innocence and integrity which the person who has received Baptism should preserve
throughout life.




The Lighted Candle

A lighted taper is then put into the hand of the baptised to signify that faith, inflamed by charity, which is
received in Baptism, is to be fed and augmented by the exercise of good works.




The Name Given In Baptism




                                                        130
Finally, a name is given the person baptised. It should be taken from some person whose eminent sanctity has
given him a place in the catalogue of the Saints. The similarity of name will stimulate each one to imitate the
virtues and holiness of the Saint, and, moreover, to hope and pray that he who is the model for his imitation will
also be his advocate and watch over the safety of his body and soul.

Wherefore those are to be reproved who search for the names of heathens, especially of those who were the
greatest monsters of iniquity, to bestow upon their children. By such conduct they practically prove how little
they regard Christian piety when they so fondly cherish the memory of impious men, as to wish to have their
profane names continually echo in the ears of the faithful.




Recapitulation

This exposition of the Sacrament of Baptism, if given by pastors, will be found to embrace almost everything
which should be known regarding this Sacrament. We have explained the meaning of the word Baptism, the
nature and substance of the Sacrament, and also the parts of which it is composed. We have said by whom it
was instituted; who are the ministers necessary to its administration; who should be, as it were, the tutors whose
instructions should sustain the weakness of the person baptised; to whom Baptism should be administered; and
how they should be disposed; what are the virtue and efficacy of the Sacrament; finally, we have developed, at
sufficient length for our purpose, the rites and ceremonies that should accompany its administration.

Pastors should recollect that the chief purpose of all these instructions is to induce the faithful to direct their
constant attention and solicitude to the fulfilment of the promises so sacredly made at Baptism, and to lead lives
not unworthy of the sanctity that should accompany the name and profession of Christian.




                                  THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION




Importance Of Instruction On Confirmation

If ever there was a time demanding the diligence of pastors in explaining the Sacrament of Confirmation, in
these days certainly it requires special attention, when there are found in the holy Church of God many by
whom this Sacrament is altogether omitted; while very few seek to obtain from it the fruit of divine grace which
they should derive from its participation.

Lest, therefore, this divine blessing may seem, through their fault, and to their most serious injury, to have been
conferred on them in vain, the faithful are to be instructed both on Whitsunday, on which day it is principally
administered, and also on such other days as pastors shall deem convenient. Their instructions should so treat
the nature, power, and dignity of this Sacrament, that the faithful may understand not only that it is not to be
neglected, hut that it is to be received with the greatest piety and devotion.




Name of this Sacrament

To begin with the name, it should be taught that this Sacrament is called by the Church Confirmation because, if
there is no obstacle to the efficacy of the Sacrament, a baptised person, when anointed with the sacred chrism
by the Bishop, with the accompanying solemn words: I sign thee with the sign of the cross, and confirm thee




                                                       131
with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, becomes stronger
with the strength of a new power, and thus begins to be a perfect soldier of Christ.




Confirmation is a Sacrament

That in Confirmation is contained the true and proper nature of a Sacrament has always been acknowledged by
the Catholic Church, as Pope Melchiades and many other very holy and very ancient Pontiffs expressly declare.
The truth of this doctrine St. Clement could not confirm in stronger terms than when he says: All should hasten
without delay to be born again unto God, and afterwards to be signed by the Bishop, that is, to receive the
sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost; for, as has been handed down to us from St. Peter, and as the other Apostles
taught in obedience to the command and of our Lord, he who culpably and voluntarily, and not from necessity,
neglects to receive this Sacrament, cannot possibly be a perfect Christian. This same faith has been confirmed,
as may be seen in their decrees, by Popes Urban, Fabian and Eusebius, who, filled with the same spirit, shed
their blood for the name of Christ.

The unanimous authority of the Fathers must be added. Among them Denis the Areopagite, Bishop of Athens,
when teaching how to consecrate and make use of this holy ointment, says: The priests clothe the person
Baptised with a garment emblematic of purity, in order to conduct him to the Bishop; and the Bishop, signing
him with the sacred and truly divine ointment, makes him partaker of the most holy communion. Of such
importance does Eusebius of Caesarea also deem this Sacrament as not to hesitate to say that the heretic
Novatus could not deserve to receive the Holy Ghost, because, having been baptised in a state of severe illness,
he was not anointed with the sign of chrism. But on this subject we have the most distinct testimonies from St.
Ambrose in his book On the Initiated, and from St. Augustine in his books Against the Epistles of Petilian the
Donatist.

Both of them were so persuaded that no doubt could exist as to the reality of this Sacrament that they even
taught and confirmed the doctrine by passages of Scripture, the one testifying that to the Sacrament of
Confirmation apply these words of the Apostle: Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed; the
other, these words of the Psalmist: Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the
beard of Aaron, and also these words of the same Apostle: The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by
the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.




Confirmation is Distinct from Baptism

Although said by Melchiades to have a most intimate connection with Baptism, Confirmation is still not to be
regarded as the same, but as a very different Sacrament; for the variety of the grace which each of the
Sacraments confers, and of the sensible sign employed to signify that grace, evidently render them distinct and
different Sacraments.

Since, then, by the grace of Baptism we are begotten unto newness of life, whereas by that of Confirmation we
grow to full maturity, having put away the things of a child, we can sufficiently understand that the same
difference that exists in the natural life between birth and growth exists also between Baptism, which
regenerates, and Confirmation, by virtue of which growth and perfect spiritual strength are imparted to the
faithful.

Besides, as there should be a new and distinct kind of Sacrament when the soul has to encounter any new
difficulty, it may easily be perceived that as we require the grace of Baptism to form the mind unto faith, so is it
also of the utmost advantage that the souls of the faithful be strengthened by a different grace, to the end that
they be deterred by no danger, or fear of pains, tortures or death, from the confession of the true faith. This,



                                                        132
then, being accomplished by the sacred chrism of Confirmation, it is hence clearly inferred, that the nature of
this Sacrament is different from Baptism.

Hence Pope Melchiades accurately evolves the difference between them, writing as follows: In Baptism man is
enlisted into the service, in Confirmation he is equipped for battle; at the baptismal font the Holy Ghost imparts
fullness to accomplish innocence, but in Confirmation he ministers perfection to grace; in Baptism we are
regenerated unto life, after Baptism we are fortified for the combat; in Baptism we are cleansed, after Baptism
we are strengthened; regeneration of itself saves those who receive Baptism in time of peace, Confirmation
arms and makes ready for conflicts.

These are truths not only already recorded by other Councils, but specially defined by the holy Council of
Trent; so that we are therefore no longer at liberty not only to think otherwise, but even to entertain the least
doubt concerning them.




Institution of Confirmation

It was shown above how necessary it is to teach concerning all the Sacraments in common from whom they had
their origin. Wherefore the same is also to be taught as regards Confirmation, in order that the faithful may be
impressed with a deeper sense of the sanctity of this Sacrament. Accordingly, pastors must explain that not only
was it instituted by Christ the Lord, but that by Him were also ordained, as Pope St. Fabian testifies, the rite of
chrism and the words which the Catholic Church uses in its administration. This is a fact easy to prove to those
who acknowledge Confirmation to be a Sacrament, because all the sacred mysteries exceed the powers of
human nature and could be instituted by no other than God alone.




Component Parts of Confirmation




The Matter

We now come to treat of the component parts of the Sacrament, and first of its matter. This is called chrism, a
word borrowed from the Greek language, and which, although used by profane writers to designate any sort of
ointment, is appropriated by common usage among ecclesiastical writers to signify that ointment only which is
composed of oil and balsam with the solemn consecration of the Bishop. A mixture of two material things,
therefore, furnishes the matter of Confirmation; and this mixture of different things not only declares the
manifold grace of the Holy Ghost given to those who are confirmed but also sufficiently shows the excellence
of the Sacrament itself.




The Remote Matter Of Confirmation Is Chrism

That such is the matter of this Sacrament the holy Church and her Councils have always taught; and the same
doctrine has been handed-down to us by St. Denis and by many other Fathers of the gravest authority,
particularly by Pope Fabian,' who testifies that the Apostles received the composition of chrism from our Lord
and transmitted it to us.




                                                        133
The Appropriateness Of Chrism

Nor indeed could any other matter than that of chrism seem more appropriate to declare the effects of this
Sacrament. Oil, by its nature rich, unctuous and fluid, expresses the fullness of grace, which, through the Holy
Ghost, overflows and is poured into others from Christ the head, like the ointment that ran down upon the beard
of Aaron, to the skirt of his garment; for God anointed him with the oil of gladness, above his fellows, and of
his fullness we all have received.

Balsam, the door of which is most pleasant, can signify nought save that the faithful, when made perfect by the
grace of Confirmation, diffuse around them such a sweet door of all virtues, that they may say with the Apostle:
We are unto God the good odour of Christ. Balsam has also the power of preserving from corruption whatever it
is used to anoint. This property seems admirably suited to express the virtue of the Sacrament, since it is quite
evident that the souls of the faithful, prepared by the heavenly grace of Confirmation, are easily protected from
the contagion of sins.




Chrism To Be Consecrated By The Bishop

The chrism is consecrated by the Bishop with solemn ceremonies; for that our Saviour gave this instruction at
His last supper, when He committed to His Apostles the manner of making chrism, we learn from Fabian, a
pontiff eminently distinguished by his sanctity and by the glory of martyrdom.

The necessity of this consecration may, however, be shown from reason also. In most of the other Sacraments
Christ so instituted their matter as to impart holiness also to it. For not only did He designate water as the
element of Baptism, saying: Except a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter the
kingdom of God; but He also, at His own Baptism, imparted to it the power of sanctifying thereafter. Hence
these words of St. Chrysostom: The water of Baptism, had it not been sanctified by contact with the body of our
Lord, could not purge away the sins of believers. As, then, our Lord did not consecrate this matter of
Confirmation by actually using and handling it, it is necessary that it be consecrated by holy and religious
prayers; and this consecration can appertain to none save the Bishop, who has been appointed the ordinary
minister of this Sacrament.




The Form Of Confirmation

The other component part of Confirmation, that is, its form and the words used at the sacred unction, must also
be explained. The faithful are to be admonished that in receiving this Sacrament they are, in particular on
hearing the words pronounced, to excite their minds to piety, faith and religion, that no obstacle may be placed
to heavenly grace.

The form of Confirmation, then, is comprised in these words: I sign thee with the sign of the cross, and I
confirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. If
we call upon reason regarding this truth, we may also easily prove the same thing; for the form of a Sacrament
should comprise all those things that explain the nature and substance of the Sacrament itself. But in
Confirmation these three things are chiefly to be noted: the divine power which, as a principal cause, operates in
the Sacrament; the strength of mind and soul which is imparted by the sacred unction to the faithful unto
salvation; and finally, the sign impressed on him who is to enter upon the warfare of Christ. Now of these the
first is sufficiently declared by the concluding words of the form: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost; the second, by the words immediately preceding them: I confirm thee with the chrism of
salvation; and the third, by the words with which the form opens: I sign thee with the sign of the cross.




                                                      134
But were we even unable to prove by reason that this is the true and perfect form of this Sacrament, the
authority of the Catholic Church, under whose guidance we have always been thus taught, suffers us not to
entertain the least doubt on the subject.




Minister of Confirmation

Pastors should also teach to whom especially has been committed the administration of this Sacrament; for as,
according to the Prophet, there are many who run without being sent, it is necessary to teach who are its true
and legitimate ministers, in order that the faithful may be enabled to receive the Sacrament and grace of
Confirmation.

Now the Holy Scriptures show that the Bishop alone is the ordinary minister of this Sacrament, because we read
in the Acts of the Apostles that when Samaria had received the Word of God, Peter and John were sent to them,
who prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost: for he was not as yet come upon any of them, but
they were only baptised. Here we may see that he who had baptised, having been only a deacon, had no power
to confirm; but that its administration was reserved to a more perfect order of ministers, that is, to the Apostles.
The same may be observed whenever the Sacred Scriptures make mention of this Sacrament.

Nor are there wanting in proof of this matter the clearest testimonies of the holy Fathers and of Popes Urban,
Eusebius, Damasus, Innocent and Leo, as is evident from their decrees. St. Augustine, also, seriously complains
of the corrupt practice of the Egyptians and Alexandrians, whose priests dared to administer the Sacrament of
Confirmation.

The thorough propriety of reserving this function to Bishops the pastor may illustrate by the following
comparison. As in the construction of buildings the artisans, who are inferior agents, prepare and dispose
cement, lime, timbers and the other material, while to the architect belongs the completion of the work; so in
like manner this Sacrament, which is, at it were, the completion of the spiritual edifice, should be performed by
no other than the chief priest.




Sponsors at Confirmation

A sponsor is also required, as we have already shown to be the case in Baptism. For if they who enter the
fencing lists have need for some one whose skill and counsel may teach them the thrusts and passes by which to
overcome their adversaries, while remaining safe themselves; how much more will the faithful require a leader
and monitor, when, sheathed, as it were, in the stoutest armour by this Sacrament of Confirmation, they engage
in the spiritual conflict, in which eternal salvation is the proposed reward. With good reason, therefore, are
sponsors employed in the administration of this Sacrament also; and the same spiritual affinity is contracted in
Confirmation, which, as we have already shown, is contracted by sponsors in Baptism, so as to impede the
lawful marriage of the parties.




The Subject of Confirmation

It often happens that, in receiving this Sacrament, the faithful are guilty of either precipitate haste or a gross
neglect and delay; concerning those who have become so impious as to have the hardihood to contemn and
despise it, we have nothing to say. Pastors, therefore, should also explain who may receive Confirmation, and
what should be their age and dispositions.




                                                        135
All Should Be Confirmed

First, it is necessary to teach that this Sacrament is not so necessary as to be utterly essential to salvation.
Although not essential, however, it ought to be omitted by no one, but rather, on the contrary, in a matter so full
of holiness through which the divine gifts are so liberally bestowed, the greater care should be taken to avoid all
neglect. What God has proposed in common unto all for their sanctification, all should 'likewise most earnestly
desire.

St. Luke, indeed, describing this admirable effusion of the Holy Spirit, says: And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house, where they were sitting; and a little
after: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. From these words we may understand that, as that house
was a type and figure of the Church, the Sacrament of Confirmation, which tool; its beginning from that day,
appertains to all the faithful.

This may also be easily inferred from the nature of the Sacrament itself. For they ought to be confirmed with the
sacred chrism who have need of spiritual increase, and who are to be led to the perfection of the Christian
religion. But this is, without exception, suited to all; because as nature intends that all her children should grow
up and attain full maturity, although she does not always realise her wishes; so the Catholic Church, the
common mother of all, earnestly desires that, in those whom she has regenerated by Baptism, the perfection of
Christian manhood be completed. Now as this is accomplished through the Sacrament of mystic Unction, it is
clear that Confirmation belongs alike to all the faithful.




The Proper Age For Confirmation

Here it is to be observed, that, after Baptism, the Sacrament of Confirmation may indeed be administered to all;
but that, until children shall have attained the use of reason, its administration is inexpedient. If it does not seem
well to defer (Confirmation) to the age of twelve, it is most proper to postpone this Sacrament at least to that of
seven years.

Confirmation has not been instituted as necessary to salvation, but that by virtue thereof we may be found very
well armed and prepared when called upon to fight for the faith of Christ; and for this conflict no one assuredly
will consider children who as yet lack the use of reason to be qualified.




Dispositions For Receiving Confirmation

From this, therefore, it follows that persons of mature age, who are to be confirmed, must, if they desire to
obtain the grace and gifts of this Sacrament, not only bring with them faith and piety, but also grieve from their
hearts for the serious sins which they have committed.

The pastor should take care that they have previous recourse to confession of their sins; should exhort them to
fasting and other works of piety; and admonish them of the propriety of reviving that laudable practice of the
ancient Church, of receiving this Sacrament fasting. It is to be presumed that to this the faithful may be easily
persuaded, if they but understand the gifts and admirable effects of this Sacrament.




The Effects of Confirmation


                                                         136
Pastors, therefore, should teach that, in common with the other Sacraments, Confirmation, unless some obstacle
be present on the part of the receiver, imparts new grace. For we have shown that these sacred and mystical
signs are of such a character as to indicate and produce grace.




The Grace Of Strength

But besides these things, which are common to this and the other (Sacraments), it is peculiar to Confirmation
first to perfect the grace of Baptism. For those who have been made Christians by Baptism, still have in some
sort the tenderness and softness, as it were, of new-born infants, and afterwards become, by means of the
Sacrament of chrism, stronger to resist all the assaults of the world, the flesh and the devil, while their minds are
fully confirmed in faith to confess and glorify the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence; also, originated the
very name (Confirmation), as no one will doubt. For the word Confirmation is not derived, as some not less
ignorantly than impiously have pretended, from the circumstance that persons baptised in infancy, when arrived
at mature years, were of old brought to the Bishop, in order to confirm their faith in Christ, which they had
embraced ill Baptism, so that Confirmation would seem not to differ from catechetical instruction. Of such a
practice no reliable testimony can be adduced. On the contrary, the name has been derived from the fact that by
virtue of this Sacrament God confirms in us the work He commenced in Baptism, leading us to the perfection of
solid Christian virtue.




Increase In Grace

But not only does it confirm, it also increases (divine grace), as says Melchiades: The Holy Ghost, whose
salutary descent upon the waters of Baptism, imparts in the font fullness to the accomplishment of innocence, in
Confirmation gives an increase of grace; and not only an increase, but an increase after a wonderful manner.
This the Scriptures beautifully express by a metaphor taken from clothing: Stay you in the city, said our Lord
and Saviour, speaking of this Sacrament, until you be clothed with power from on high.

If pastors wish to show the divine efficacy of this Sacrament -- and this, no doubt, will have great influence in
affecting the minds of the faithful -- it will be sufficient if they explain what occurred to the Apostles
themselves. So weak and timid were they before, and even at the very time of the Passion, that no sooner was
our Lord apprehended, than they instantly fled ; and Peter, who had been designated the rock and foundation of
the Church, and who had displayed unshaken constancy and exalted magnanimity, terrified at the voice of one
weak woman, denied, not once nor twice only, but a third time, that he was a disciple of Jesus Christ; and after
the Resurrection they all remained shut up at home for fear of the Jews. But, on the day of Pentecost, so great
was the power of the Holy Ghost with which they were all filled that, while they boldly and freely disseminated
the Gospel confided to them, not only through Judea, but throughout the world, they thought no greater
happiness could await them than that of being accounted worthy to suffer contumely, chains, torments and
crucifixion, for the name of Christ.




Character Of Soldier Of Christ

Confirmation has also the effect of impressing a character. Hence, as we before said of Baptism, and as will be
more fully explained in its proper place with regard to the Sacrament of Orders also, it can on no account ever
be repeated.




                                                        137
If, then, these things be frequently and accurately explained by pastors, it will be almost impossible that the
faithful, having known the utility and dignity of this Sacrament, should not use every exertion to receive it with
purity and devotion.




Ceremonies Of Confirmation

It remains now briefly to glance at the rites and ceremonies used by the Catholic Church in the administration of
this Sacrament; and pastors will understand the great advantages of this explanation, if they revert to what we
already said on this subject under its proper head.




The Anointing Of The Forehead

The forehead, then, of the persons to be confirmed is anointed with sacred chrism; for by this Sacrament the
Holy Spirit infuses Himself into the souls of the faithful, and increases in them strength and fortitude to enable
them, in the spiritual contest, to fight manfully and to resist their most wicked foes. Wherefore it is indicated
that they are to be deterred by no fear or shame, the signs of which appear chiefly on the forehead, from the
open confession of the name of Christ.




The Sign Of The Cross

Besides, that mark by which the Christian is distinguished from all others, as the soldier is by certain badges,
should be impressed on the more conspicuous part of the body.




Time When Confirmation Should Be Conferred

It has also been a matter of solemn religious observance in the Church of God that this Sacrament should be
administered principally at Pentecost, because on that day especially were the Apostles strengthened and
confirmed by the power of the Holy Ghost. By the recollection of this supernatural event the faithful should be
admonished of the nature and magnitude of the mysteries contained in the sacred unction.




The Slap On The Cheek

The person when anointed and confirmed next receives a gentle slap on the cheek from the hand of the Bishop
to make him recollect that, as a valiant combatant, he should be prepared to endure with unconquered spirit all
adversities for the name of Christ.




The Pax

Lastly, the peace is given him, that he may understand that he has attained the fullness of divine grace and that
peace which passeth all understanding.



                                                       138
Admonition

Let this, then, serve as a summary of those things which pastors are to expound touching the Sacrament of
chrism. The exposition, however, should not be given so much in empty words and cold language, as in the
burning accents of pious and glowing zeal, so as to seem to imprint them on the souls and inmost thoughts of
the faithful.




                                  THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST




Importance Of Instruction On The Eucharist

As of all the sacred mysteries bequeathed to us by our Lord and Saviour as most infallible instruments of divine
grace, there is none comparable to the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist; so, for no crime is there a heavier
punishment to be feared from God than for the unholy or irreligious use by the faithful of that which is full of
holiness, or rather which contains the very author and source of holiness. This the Apostle wisely saw, and has
openly admonished us of it. For when he had declared the enormity of their guilt who discerned not the body of
the Lord, he immediately subjoined: Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep.

In order that the faithful, therefore, aware of the divine honours due to this heavenly Sacrament, may derive
therefrom abundant fruit of grace and escape the most just anger of God, pastors should explain with the
greatest diligence all those things which may seem calculated more fully to display its majesty.




Institution of the Eucharist

In this matter it will be necessary that pastors, following the example of the Apostle Paul, who professes to have
delivered to the Corinthians what he had received from the Lord, first of all explain to the faithful the institution
of this Sacrament.

That its institution was as follows, is clearly inferred from the Evangelist. Our Lord, having loved his own,
loved them to the end. As a divine and admirable pledge of this love, knowing that the hour had now come that
He should pass from the world to the Father, that He-might not ever at any period be absent from His own, He
accomplished with inexplicable wisdom that which surpasses all the order and condition of nature. For having
kept the supper of the Paschal lamb with His disciples, that the figure might yield to the reality, the shadow to
the substance, He took bread, and giving thanks unto God, He blessed, and brake, and gave to the disciples, and
said: "Take ye and eat, this is my body which shall be delivered for you; this do for a commemoration of me."
In like manner also, He took the chalice after he had supped, saying: "This chalice is the new testament in my
blood; this do, as often as you shall drink it, in commemoration of me".




Meaning of the Word "Eucharist"

Wherefore sacred writers, seeing that it was not at all possible that they should manifest by one term the dignity
and excellence of this admirable Sacrament, endeavoured to express it by many words.



                                                        139
For sometimes they call it Eucharist, which word we may render either by good grace, or by thanksgiving. And
rightly, indeed, is it to be called good grace, as well because it first signifies eternal life, concerning which it has
been written: The grace of God is eternal life; and also because it contains Christ the Lord, who is true grace
and the fountain of all favours.

No less aptly do we interpret it thanksgiving; inasmuch as when we immolate this purest victim, we give daily
unbounded thanks to God for all His kindnesses towards us, and above all for so excellent a gift of His grace,
which He grants to us in this Sacrament. This same name, also, is fully in keeping with those things which we
read were done by Christ the Lord at the institution of this mystery. For taking bread he brake it, and gave
thanks. David also, when contemplating the greatness of this mystery, before he pronounced that song: He hath
made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord, he hath given food to them
that fear him, thought that he should first make this act of thanksgiving: His work is praise and magnificence.




Other Names Of This Sacrament

Frequently, also, it is called Sacrifice. Concerning this mystery there will be occasion to speak more at length
presently.

It is called, moreover, communion, the term being evidently borrowed from that passage of the Apostle where
we read: The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the
bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? For, as Damascene has explained, this
Sacrament unites us to Christ, renders us partakers of His flesh and Divinity, reconciles and unites us to one
another in the same Christ, and forms us, as it were, into one body.

Whence it came to pass, that i. was called also the Sacrament of peace and love. We can understand then how
unworthy they are of the name of Christian who cherish enmities, and how hatred, dissensions and discord
should be entirely put away, as the most destructive bane of the faithful, especially since by the daily Sacrifice
of our religion, we profess to preserve nothing with more anxious care, than peace and love.

It is also frequently called the Viaticum by sacred writers, both because it is spiritual food by which we are
sustained in our pilgrimage through this life, and also because it paves our way to eternal glory and happiness.
Wherefore, according to an ancient usage of the Catholic Church, we see that none of the faithful are permitted
to die without this Sacrament.

The most ancient Fathers, following the authority of the Apostle, have sometimes also called the Holy Eucharist
by the name of Supper, because it was instituted by Christ the Lord at the salutary mystery of the Last Supper.

It is not, however, lawful to consecrate or partake of the Eucharist after eating or drinking, because, according
to a custom wisely introduced by the Apostles, as ancient writers have recorded, and which has ever been
retained and preserved, Communion is received only by persons who are fasting.




The Eucharist Is a Sacrament Properly So Called

The meaning of the name having been explained, it will be necessary to show that this is a true Sacrament, and
one of those seven which the holy Church has ever revered and venerated religiously. For when the
consecration of the chalice is effected, it is called a mystery of faith.

Besides, to omit the almost endless testimonies of sacred writers, who have invariably thought that this was to
be numbered among the real Sacraments, the same thing is proved from the very principle and nature of a



                                                         140
Sacrament. For there are in it signs that are external and subject to the senses. In the next place it signifies and
produces grace. Moreover, neither the Evangelists nor the Apostle leave room for doubt regarding its institution
by Christ. Since all these things concur to establish the fact of the Sacrament, there is obviously no need of any
other argument.




In What Respect The Eucharist Is A Sacrament

But pastors should carefully observe that in this mystery there are many things to which sacred writers have
from time to time attributed the name of Sacrament. For, sometimes, both the consecration and the Communion;
nay, frequently also the body and blood itself of our Lord, which is contained in the Eucharist, used to be called
a Sacrament. Thus St. Augustine says that this Sacrament consists of two things, -- the visible species of the
elements, and the invisible flesh and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. And it is in the same sense that we
say that this Sacrament is to be adored, meaning the body and blood of our Lord.

Now it is plain that all these are less properly called Sacraments. The species of bread and wine themselves are
truly and strictly designated by this name.




How The Eucharist Differs From All The Other Sacraments

How much this Sacrament differs from all the others is easily inferred. For all the other Sacraments are
completed by the use of the material, that is, while they are being administered to some one. Thus Baptism.
attains the nature of a Sacrament when the individual is actually being washed in the water. For the perfecting
of the Eucharist on the other hand, the consecration of the material itself suffices, since neither (species) ceases
to be a Sacrament, though kept in the pyx.

Again in perfecting the other Sacraments there is no change of the matter and element into another nature. The
water of Baptism, or the oil of Confirmation, when those Sacraments are being administered, do not lose their
former nature of water and oil; but in the Eucharist, that which was bread and wine before consecration, after
consecration is truly the substance of the body and blood of the Lord.




The Eucharist Is But One Sacrament

But although there are two elements, as bread and wine, of which the entire Sacrament of the Eucharist is
constituted, yet guided by the authority of the Church, we confess that this is not many Sacraments, but only
one.

Otherwise, there cannot be the exact number of seven Sacraments, as has ever been handed down, and as was
decreed by the Councils of Lateran, Florence and Trent.

Moreover, by virtue of the Sacrament, one mystical body is effected; hence, that the Sacrament itself may
correspond to the thing which it effects, it must be one.

It is one not because it is indivisible, but because it signifies a single thing. For as food and drink, which are two
different things, are employed only for one purpose, namely, that the vigour of the body may be recruited; so
also it was but natural that there should be an analogy to them in the two different species of the Sacrament,
which should signify the spiritual food by which souls are supported and refreshed. Wherefore we have been
assured by our Lord the Saviour: My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.


                                                        141
The Eucharist Signifies Three Things

It must, therefore, be diligently explained what the Sacrament of the Eucharist signifies, that the faithful,
beholding the sacred mysteries with their eyes, may also at the same time feed their souls with the
contemplation of divine things. Three things, then, are signified by this Sacrament. The first is the Passion of
Christ our Lord, a thing past; for He Himself said: Do this for a commemoration of me, and the Apostle says:
As often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until he come.

It is also significant of divine and heavenly grace, which is imparted at the present time by this Sacrament to
nurture and preserve the soul. Just as in Baptism we are begotten unto newness of life and by Confirmation are
strengthened to resist Satan and openly to profess the name of Christ, so by the Sacrament of the Eucharist are
we nurtured and supported.

It is, thirdly, a foreshadowing of future eternal joy and glory, which, according to God's promises, we shall
receive in our heavenly country.

These three things, then, which are clearly distinguished by their reference to past, present and future times, are
so well represented by the Eucharistic mysteries that the whole Sacrament, though consisting of different
species, signifies the three as if it referred to one thing only.




Constituent Parts of the Eucharist




The Matter

It is particularly incumbent on pastors to know the matter of this Sacrament, in order that they themselves may
rightly consecrate it, and also that they may be able to instruct the faithful as to its significance, inflaming them
with an earnest desire of that which it signifies.




The First Element Of The Eucharist Is Bread

The matter of this Sacrament is twofold. The first element is wheaten bread, of which we shall now speak. Of
the second we shall treat hereafter. As the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke testify, Christ the Lord took
bread into His hands, blessed, and brake, saying: This is my body; and, according to John, the same Saviour
called Himself bread in these words: I am the living bread, that came down from heaven.




The Sacramental Bread Must Be Wheaten

There are, however, various sorts of bread, either because they consist of different materials, -- such as wheat,
barley, pulse and other products of the earth; or because they possess different qualities, -- some being leavened,
others altogether without leaven. It is to be observed that, with regard to the former kinds, the words of the
Saviour show that the bread should be wheaten; for, according to common usage, when we simply say bread,
we are sufficiently understood to mean wheaten bread. This is also declared by a figure in the Old Testament,



                                                        142
because the Lord commanded that the loaves of proposition, which signified this Sacrament, should be made of
fine flour.




The Sacramental Bread Should Be Unleavened

But as wheaten bread alone is to be considered the proper matter for this Sacrament -- a doctrine which has been
handed down by Apostolic tradition and confirmed by the authority of the Catholic Church -- so it may be
easily inferred from the doings of Christ the Lord that this bread should be unleavened. It was consecrated and
instituted by Him on the first day of unleavened bread, on which it was not lawful for the Jews to have anything
leavened in their house.

Should the authority of John the Evangelist, who says that all this was done before the feast of the Passover, be
objected to, the argument is one of easy solution. For by the day before the pasch John understands the same
day which the other Evangelists designate as the first day of unleavened bread. He wished particularly to mark
the natural day, which commences at sunrise; whereas they wanted to point out that our Lord celebrated the
Pasch on Thursday evening just when the days of the unleavened bread were beginning. Hence St. Chrysostom
also understands the first day of unleavened bread to be the day on the evening of which unleavened bread was
to be eaten.

The peculiar suitableness of the consecration of unleavened bread to express that integrity and purity of mind
which the faithful should bring to this Sacrament we learn from these words of the Apostle: Purge out the old
leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover is sacrificed. Therefore, let
us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread
of sincerity and truth.




Unleavened Bread Not Essential

This quality of the bread, however, is not to be deemed so essential that, if it be wanting, the Sacrament cannot
exist; for both kinds are called by the one name and have the true and proper nature of bread. No one, however,
is at liberty on his own private authority, or rather presumption, to transgress the laudable rite of his Church.
And such departure is the less warrantable in priests of the Latin Church, expressly obliged as they are by the
supreme Pontiffs, to consecrate the sacred mysteries with unleavened bread only.




Quantity Of The Bread

With regard to the first matter of this Sacrament, let this exposition suffice. It is, however, to be observed, that
the quantity of the matter to be consecrated is not defined, since we cannot define the exact number of those
who can or ought to receive the sacred mysteries.'




The Second Element Of The Eucharist Is Wine

It remains for us to treat of the other matter and element of this Sacrament, which is wine pressed from the fruit
of the vine, with which is mingled a little water.




                                                        143
That in the institution of this Sacrament our Lord and Saviour made use of wine has beep at all times the
doctrine of the Catholic Church, for He Himself said: I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine
until that day. On this passage Chrysostom observes: He says, "Of the fruit of the vine," which certainly
produced wine not water; as if he had it in view, even at so early a period, to uproot the heresy which asserted
that in these mysteries water alone is to be used.




Water Should Be Mixed With The Wine

With the wine, however, the Church of God has always mingled water. First, because Christ the Lord did so, as
is proved by the authority of Councils and the testimony of St. Cyprian; next, because by this mixture is
renewed the recollection of the blood and water that issued from His side. Waters, also, as we read in the
Apocalypse, signify the people; and hence, water mixed with the wine signifies the union of the faithful with
Christ their Head. This rite, derived as it is from Apostolic tradition, the Catholic Church has always observed.

But although there are reasons so grave for mingling water with the wine that it cannot be omitted without
incurring the guilt of mortal sin, yet its omission does not render the Sacrament null.

Again as in the sacred mysteries priests must be mindful to mingle water with wine, so, also, must they take
care to mingle it in small quantity, for, in the opinion and judgment of ecclesiastical writers, that water is
changed into wine. Hence these words of Pope Honorius on the subject: A pernicious abuse has prevailed in
your district of using in the sacrifice a greater quantity of water than of wine; whereas, according to the rational
practice of the universal Church, the wine should be used in much greater quantity than the water.




No Other Elements Pertain To This Sacrament

These, then, are the only two elements of this Sacrament; and with reason has it been enacted by many decrees
that, although there have been those who were not afraid to do so, it is unlawful to offer anything but bread and
wine.




Peculiar Fitness Of Bread And Wine

We have now to consider the aptitude of these two symbols of bread and wine to represent those things of
which we believe and confess they are the sensible signs.

In the first place, then, they signify to us Christ, as the true life of men; for our Lord Himself says: My flesh is
meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. As, then, the body of Christ the Lord furnishes nourishment unto
eternal life to those who receive this Sacrament with purity and holiness, rightly is the matter composed chiefly
of those elements by which our present life is sustained, in order that the faithful may easily understand that the
mind and soul are satiated by the Communion of the precious body and blood of Christ.

These very elements serve also somewhat to suggest to men the truth of the Real Presence of the body and
blood of the Lord in the Sacrament. Observing, as we do, that bread and wine are every day changed by the
power of nature into human flesh and blood, we are led the more easily by this analogy to believe that the
substance of the bread and wine is changed, by the heavenly benediction, into the real flesh and real blood of
Christ.




                                                        144
This admirable change of the elements also helps to shadow forth what takes place in the soul. Although no
change of the bread and wine appears externally, yet their substance is truly changed into the flesh and blood of
Christ; so, in like manner, although in us nothing appears changed, yet we are renewed inwardly unto life, when
we receive in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the true life.

Moreover, the body of the Church, which is one, consists of many members, and of this union nothing is more
strikingly illustrative than the elements of bread and wine; for bread is made from many grains and wine is
pressed from many clusters of grapes. Thus they signify that we, though many, are most closely bound together
by the bond of this divine mystery and made, as it were, one body.




Form Of The Eucharist

The form to be used in the consecration of the bread is next to be treated of, not, however, in order that the
faithful should be taught these mysteries, unless necessity require it; for this knowledge is not needful for those
who have not received Holy Orders. The purpose (of this section) is to guard against most shameful mistakes on
the part of priests, at the time of the consecration, due to ignorance of the form.




Form To Be Used In The Consecration Of The Bread

We are then taught by the holy Evangelists, Matthew and Luke, and also by the Apostle, that the form consists
of these words: This is my body; for it is written: Whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,
and brake, and gave to his disciples, and said: Take and eat, This is my body.

This form of consecration having been observed by Christ the Lord has been always used by the Catholic
Church. The testimonies of the Fathers, the enumeration of which would be endless, and also the decree of the
Council of Florence, which is well known and accessible to all, must here be omitted, especially as the
knowledge which they convey may be obtained from these words of the Saviour: Do this for a commemoration
of me. For what the Lord enjoined was not only what He had done, but also what he had said; and especially is
this true, since the words were uttered not only to signify, but also to accomplish.

That these words constitute the form is easily proved from reason also. The form is that which signifies what is
accomplished in this Sacrament; but as the preceding words signify and declare what takes place in the
Eucharist, that is, the conversion of the bread into the true body of our Lord, it therefore follows that these very
words constitute the form. In this sense may be understood the words of the Evangelist: He blessed; for they
seem equivalent to this: Taking bread, he blessed it, saying: "This is my body".




Not All The Words Used Are Essential

Although in the Evangelist the words, Take and eat, precede the words (This is my body), they evidently
express the use only, not the consecration, of the matter. Wherefore, while they are not necessary to the
consecration of the Sacrament, they are by all means to be pronounced by the priest, as is also the conjunction
for in the consecration of the body and blood. But they are not necessary to the validity of the Sacrament,
otherwise it would follow that, if this Sacrament were not to be administered to anyone, it should not, or indeed
could not, be consecrated; whereas, no one can lawfully doubt that the priest, by pronouncing the words of our
Lord according to the institution and practice of the Church, truly consecrates the proper matter of the bread,
even though it should afterwards never be administered.




                                                        145
Form To Be Used In The Consecration Of The Wine

With regard lo the consecration of the wine, which is the other element of this Sacrament, the priest, for the
reason we have already assigned, ought of necessity to be well acquainted with, and well understand its form.
We are then firmly to believe that it consists in the following words: This is the chalice of my blood, of the new
and eternal testament, the mystery of faith, which shall be shed for you and for many, to the remission of sins.
Of these words the greater part are taken from Scripture; but some have been preserved in the Church from
Apostolic tradition.

Thus the words, this is the chalice, are found in St. Luke and in the Apostle; but the words that immediately
follow, of my blood, or my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for you and for many to the
remission of sins, are found partly in St. Luke and partly in St. Matthew. But the words, eternal, and the mystery
of faith, have been taught us by holy tradition, the interpreter and keeper of Catholic truth.

Concerning this form no one can doubt, if he here also attend to what has been already said about the form used
in the consecration of the bread. The form to be used (in the consecration) of this element, evidently consists of
those words which signify that the substance of the wine is changed into the blood of our Lord. since, therefore,
the words already cited clearly declare this, it is plain that no other words constitute the form.

They moreover express certain admirable fruits of the blood shed in the Passion of our Lord, fruits which
pertain in a most special manner to this Sacrament. Of these, one is access to the eternal inheritance, which has
come to us by right of the new and everlasting testament. Another is access to righteousness by the mystery of
faith; for God hath set forth Jesus to be a propitiator through faith in his blood, that he himself may be just, and
the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus. Christ. A third effect is the remission of sins.




Explanation Of The Form Used In The Consecration Of The Wine

Since these very words of consecration are replete with mysteries and most appropriately suitable to the subject,
they demand a more minute consideration.

The words: This is the chalice of my blood, are to be understood to mean: This is my blood, which is contained
in this chalice. The mention of the chalice made at the consecration of the blood is right and appropriate,
inasmuch as the blood is the drink of the faithful, and this would not be sufficiently signified if it were not
contained in some drinking vessel.

Next follow the words: Of the new testament. These have been added that we might understand the blood of
Christ the Lord to be given not under a figure, as was done in the Old Law, of which we read in the Epistle to
the Hebrews that without blood a testament is not dedicated; but to be given to men in truth and in reality, as
becomes the New Testament. Hence the Apostle says: Christ therefore is the mediator of the new testament, that
by means of his death, they who are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

The word eternal refers to the eternal inheritance, the right to which we acquire by the death of Christ the Lord,
the eternal testator.

The words mystery of faith, which are subjoined, do not exclude the reality, but signify that what lies hidden
and concealed and far removed from the perception of the eye, is to be believed with firm faith. In this passage,
however, these words bear a meaning different from that which they have when applied also to Baptism. Here
the mystery of faith consists in seeing by faith the blood of Christ veiled under the species of wine; but Baptism




                                                        146
is justly called by us the Sacrament of faith, by the Greeks, the mystery of faith, because it embraces the entire
profession of the Christian faith.

Another reason why we call the blood of the Lord the mystery of faith is that human reason is particularly beset
with difficulty and embarrassment when faith proposes to our belief that Christ the Lord, the true Son of God, at
once God and man, suffered death for us, and this death is designated by the Sacrament of His blood.

Here, therefore, rather than at the consecration of His body, is appropriately commemorated the Passion of our
Lord, by the words. which shall be shed for the remission of sins. For the blood, separately consecrated, serves
to place before the eyes of all, in a more forcible manner, the Passion of our Lord, His death, and the nature of
His sufferings.

The additional words for you and for many, are taken, some from Matthew, some from Luke, but were joined
together by the Catholic Church under the guidance of the Spirit of God. They serve to declare the fruit and
advantage of His Passion. For if we look to its value, we must confess that the Redeemer shed His blood for the
salvation of all; but if we look to the fruit which mankind have received from it, we shall easily find that it
pertains not unto all, but to many of the human race. When therefore ('our Lord) said: For you, He meant either
those who were present, or those chosen from among the Jewish people, such as were, with the exception of
Judas, the disciples with whom He was speaking. When He added, And for many, He wished to be understood
to mean the remainder of the elect from among the Jews or Gentiles.

With reason, therefore, were the words for all not used, as in this place the fruits of the Passion are alone spoken
of, and to the elect only did His Passion bring the fruit of salvation. And this is the purport of the Apostle when
he says: Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; and also of the words of our Lord in John: I pray
for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me, because they are thine.

Beneath the words of this consecration lie hid many other mysteries, which by frequent meditation and study of
sacred things, pastors will find it easy, with the divine assistance, to discover for themselves.




Three Mysteries Of The Eucharist

We must now return to an explanation of those truths concerning the Eucharist about which the faithful are on
no account to be left in ignorance. Pastors, aware of the warning of the Apostle that those who discern not the
body of the Lord are guilty of a most grave crime, should first of all impress on the minds of the faithful the
necessity of detaching, as much as possible, their mind and understanding from the dominion of the senses; for
if they believe that this Sacrament contains only what the senses disclose, they will of necessity fall into
enormous impiety. Consulting the sight, the touch, the smell, the taste and finding nothing but the appearances
of bread and wine, they will naturally judge that this Sacrament contains nothing more than bread and wine.
Their minds, therefore, are as much as possible to be withdrawn from subjection to the senses and excited to the
contemplation of the stupendous might and power of God.

The Catholic Church firmly believes and professes that in this Sacrament the words of consecration accomplish
three wondrous and admirable effects.

The first is that the true body of Christ the Lord, the same that was born of the Virgin, and is now seated at the
right hand of the Father in heaven, is contained in this Sacrament.

The second, however repugnant it may appear to the senses, is that none of the substance of the elements
remains in the Sacrament.




                                                       147
The third, which may be deduced from the two preceding. although the words of consecration themselves
clearly express it, is that the accidents which present themselves to the eyes or other senses exist in a wonderful
and ineffable manner without a subject. All the accidents of bread and wine we can see, but they inhere in no
substance, and exist independently of any; for the substance of the bread and wine is so changed into the body
and blood of our Lord that they altogether cease to be the substance of bread and wine.




The Mystery of the Real Presence

To begin with the first (of these mysteries), pastors should give their best attention to show how clear and
explicit are the words of our Saviour which establish the Real Presence of His body in this Sacrament.




Proof From Scripture

When our Lord says: This is my body, this is my blood, no person of sound mind can mistake His meaning,
particularly since there is reference to Christ's human nature, the reality of which the Catholic faith permits no
one to doubt. The admirable words of St. Hilary, a man not less eminent for piety than learning, are apt here:
When our Lord himself declares, as our faith teaches us, that His flesh is food indeed, what room can remain for
doubt concerning the real presence of His body and blood?

Pastors should also adduce another passage from which it can be clearly seen that the true body and blood of
our Lord are contained in the Eucharist. The Apostle, after having recorded the consecration of bread and wine
by our Lord, and also the administration of Communion to the Apostles, adds: But let a man prove himself, and
so eat of that bread and drink of the chalice; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. If, as heretics continually repeat, the Sacrament
presents nothing to our veneration but a memorial and sign of the Passion of Christ, why was there need to
exhort the faithful, in language so energetic, to prove themselves? By the terrible word judgment, the Apostle
shows how enormous is the guilt of those who receive unworthily and do not distinguish from common food the
body of the Lord concealed in the Eucharist. In the same Epistle St. Paul had already developed this doctrine
more fully, when he said: The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
Christ? and the bread which we break, is it not the participation of the body of the Lord ? Now these words
signify the real substance of the body and blood of Christ the Lord.




Proof From The Teaching Of The Church

These passages of Scripture are therefore to be expounded by pastors; and they should especially teach that
there is nothing doubtful or uncertain about them. All the more certain are they since the infallible teaching of
God's Church has interpreted them, as may be ascertained in a twofold manner.




Testimony Of The Fathers

The first is by consulting the Fathers who flourished in the early ages of the Church and in each succeeding
century, who are the most unexceptionable witnesses of her doctrine. All of these teach in the clearest terms and
with the most entire unanimity the truth of this dogma. To adduce the individual testimony of each Father
would prove an endless task. It is enough, therefore, that we cite, or rather point out a few, whose testimony will
afford an easy criterion by which to judge of the rest.



                                                       148
Let St. Ambrose first declare his faith. In his book On Those Who are Initiated Into the Mysteries he says that
the true body of Christ is received in this Sacrament, just as the true body of Christ was derived from the Virgin,
and that this truth is to be believed with the firm certainty of faith. In another place he teaches that before
consecration there is only bread, but after consecration there is the flesh of Christ.

St. Chrysostom, another witness of equal authority and gravity, professes and proclaims this mysterious truth in
many passages, but particularly in his sixtieth homily, On Those Who Receive The Sacred Mysteries
Unworthily; and also in his forty-fourth and forty-fifth homilies on St. John. Let us, he says, obey, not
contradict God, although what He says may seem contrary to our reason and our sight. His words cannot
deceive, our senses are easily deceived.

With this doctrine fully agrees the uniform teaching of St. Augustine, that most zealous defender of Catholic
faith, particularly when in his explanation of the thirty-third Psalm he says: To carry himself in his own hands is
impossible to man, and peculiar to Christ alone; He was carried in His own hands when, giving His body to be
eaten, He said, This is my body.

To pass by Justin and Irenaeus, St. Cyril, in his fourth book on St. John, declares in such express terms that the
true body of our Lord is contained in this Sacrament, that no sophistry, no captious interpretations can obscure
his meaning.

Should pastors wish for additional testimonies of the Fathers, they will find it easy to add St. Denis,- St. Hilary,
St. Jerome, St. Damascene and a host of others, whose weighty teaching on this most important subject has been
collected by the labor and industry of learned and pious men.




Teaching Of The Councils

Another means of ascertaining the belief of the holy Church on matters of faith is the condemnation of the
contrary doctrine and opinion. It is manifest that belief in the Real Presence of the body of Christ in the holy
Sacrament of the Eucharist was so spread and taught throughout the universal Church and unanimously
professed by all the faithful, that when, five centuries ago, Berengarius presumed to deny this dogma, asserting
that the Eucharist was only a sign, he was unanimously condemned in the Council of Vercelli, which Leo IX
had immediately convoked, whereupon he himself anathematised his error.

Relapsing, however, into the same wicked folly, he was condemned by three different Councils, convened, one
at Tours, the other two at Rome; of the two latter, one was summoned by Pope Nicholas II, the other by Pope
Gregory VIII.' The General Council of Lateran, held under Innocent III, further ratified the sentence. Finally
this truth was more clearly defined and established in the Councils of Florence and Trent.




Two Great Benefits Of Proving The Real Presence

If, then, pastors will carefully explain these particulars, they will be able, while ignoring those who are blinded
by error and hate nothing more than the light of truth, to strengthen the weak and administer joy and consolation
to the pious, all the more as the faithful cannot doubt that this dogma is numbered among the Articles of faith.




Faith Is Strengthened




                                                       149
Believing and confessing, as they do, that the power of God is supreme over all things, they must also believe
that His omnipotence can accomplish the great work which we admire and adore in the Sacrament of the
Eucharist. And again since they believe the Holy Catholic Church, they must necessarily believe that the true
doctrine of this Sacrament is that which we have set forth.




The Soul Is Gladdened

Nothing contributes more to the spiritual joy and advantage of pious persons than the contemplation of the
exalted dignity of this most august Sacrament. In the first place they learn how great is the perfection of the
Gospel Dispensation, under which we enjoy the reality of that which under the Mosaic Law was only shadowed
forth by types and figures. Hence St. Denis divinely says that our Church is midway between the Synagogue
and the heavenly Jerusalem, and consequently participates of the nature of both. Certainly, then, the faithful can
never sufficiently admire the perfection of holy Church and her exalted glory which seems to be removed only
by one degree from the bliss of heaven. In common with the inhabitants of heaven, we too possess Christ, God
and man, present with us. They are raised a degree above us, inasmuch as they are present with Christ and enjoy
the Beatific Vision; while we, with a firm and unwavering faith, adore the Divine Majesty present with us, not,
it is true, in a manner visible to mortal eye, but hidden by a miracle of power under the veil of the sacred
mysteries.

Furthermore the faithful experience in this Sacrament the most perfect love of Christ our Saviour. It became the
goodness of the Saviour not to withdraw from us that nature which He assumed from us, but to desire, as far as
possible, to remain among us so that at all times He might be seen to verify the words: My delight is to be with
the children of men.




Meaning of the Real Presence




Christ Whole And Entire Is Present In The Eucharist

Here the pastor should explain that in this Sacrament are contained not only the true body of. Christ and all the
constituents of a true body, such as bones and sinews, but also Christ whole and entire. He should point out that
the word Christ designates the God-man, that is to say, one Person in whom are united the divine and human
natures; that the Holy Eucharist, therefore, contains both, and whatever is included in the idea of both, the
Divinity and humanity whole and entire, consisting of the soul, all the parts of the body and the blood,- all of
which must be believed to be in this Sacrament. In heaven the whole humanity is united to the Divinity in one
hypostasis, or Person; hence it would be impious, to suppose that the body of Christ, which is contained in the
Sacrament, is separated from His Divinity.




Presence In Virtue Of The Sacrament And In Virtue Of Concomitance

Pastors, however, should not fail to observe that in this Sacrament not all these things are contained after the
same manner, or by the same power. Some things, we say, are present in virtue of the consecration; for as the
words of consecration effect what they signify, sacred writers usually say that whatever the form expresses, is
contained in the Sacrament by virtue of the Sacrament. Hence, could we suppose any one thing to be entirely
separated from the rest, the Sacrament, they teach, would be found to contain solely what the form expresses
and nothing more.



                                                       150
On the other hand, some things are contained in the Sacrament because they are united to those which are
expressed in the form. For instance, the words This is my body, which comprise the form used to consecrate the
bread, signify the body of the Lord, and hence the body itself of Christ the Lord is contained in the Eucharist by
virtue of the Sacrament. Since, however, to Christ's body are united His blood, His soul, and His Divinity, all of
these also must be found to coexist in the Sacrament; not, however, by virtue of the consecration, but by virtue
of the union that subsists between them and His body. All these are said to be in the Eucharist by virtue of
concomitance. Hence it is clear that Christ, whole and entire, is contained in the Sacrament; for when two things
are actually united, where one is, the other must also be.




Christ Whole And Entire Present Under Each Species

Hence it also follows that Christ is so contained, whole and entire, under either species, that, as under the
species of bread are contained not only the body, but also the blood and Christ entire; so in like manner, under
the species of wine are truly contained not only the blood, but also the body and Christ entire.

But although these are matters on which the faithful cannot entertain a doubt, it was nevertheless wisely
ordained that two distinct consecrations should take place. First, because they represent in a more lively manner
the Passion of our Lord, in -which His blood was separated from His body; and hence in the form of
consecration we commemorate the shedding of His blood. Secondly, since the Sacrament is to be used by us as
the food and nourishment of our souls, it was most appropriate that it should be instituted as food and drink, two
things which obviously constitute the complete sustenance of the (human) body.




Christ Whole And Entire Present In Every Part Of Each Species

Nor should it be forgotten that Christ, whole and entire, is contained not only under either species, but also in
each particle of either species. Each, says St. Augustine, receives Christ the Lord, and He is entire in each
portion. He is not diminished by being given to many, but gives Himself whole and entire to each.

This is also an obvious inference from the narrative of the Evangelists. It is not to be supposed that our Lord
consecrated the bread used at the Last Supper in separate parts, applying the form particularly to each, but that
all the bread then used for the sacred mysteries was consecrated at the same time and with the same form, and in
a quantity sufficient for all the Apostles. That the consecration of the chalice was performed in this manner, is
clear from these words of the Saviour: Take and divide it among you.

What has hitherto been said is intended to enable pastors to show that the true body and blood of Christ are
contained in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.




The Mystery of Transubstantiation

The next point to be explained is that the substance of the bread and wine does not continue to exist in the
Sacrament after consecration. This truth, although well calculated to excite our profound admiration, is yet a
necessary consequence from what has been already established.




Proof From The Dogma Of The Real Presence




                                                       151
If, after consecration, the true body of Christ is present under the species of bread and wine, since it was not
there before, it must have become present either by change of place, or by creation, or by the change of some
other thing into it. It cannot be rendered present by change of place, because it would then cease to be in
heaven; for whatever is moved must necessarily cease to occupy the place from which it is moved. Still less can
we suppose the body of Christ to be rendered present by creation; nay, the very idea is inconceivable. In order
that the body of our Lord be present in the Sacrament, it remains, therefore, that it be rendered present by the
change of the bread into it. Wherefore it is necessary that none of the substance of the bread remain.




Proof From The Councils

Hence our predecessors in the faith, the Fathers of the General Councils of Lateran and of Florence, confirmed
by solemn decrees the truth of this dogma. In the Council of Trent it was still more fully defined in these words:
If any one shall say that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist the substance of the bread and wine
remains, together with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, let hint be anathema.




Proof From Scripture

The doctrine thus defined is a natural inference from the words of Scripture. When instituting this Sacrament,
our Lord Himself said: This is my body. The word this expresses the entire substance of the thing present; and
therefore if the substance of the bread remained, our Lord could not have truly said: This is my body.

In St. John Christ the Lord also says: The bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world. The bread
which He promises to give, He here declares to be His flesh. A little after He adds: Unless you eat the flesh of
the son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. And again: My flesh is meat indeed, and my
blood is drink indeed. Since, therefore, in terms so clear and so explicit, He calls His flesh bread and meat
indeed, and His blood drink indeed, He gives us sufficiently to understand that none of the substance of the
bread and wine remains in the Sacrament.




Proof From The Fathers

Whoever turns over the pages of the holy Fathers will easily perceive that on this doctrine (of
transubstantiation) they have been at all times unanimous. St. Ambrose says: You say, perhaps, "this bread is no
other than what is used for common food." True, before consecration it is bread; but no sooner are the words of
consecration pronounced than from bread it becomes the flesh of Christ. To prove this position more clearly, he
elucidates it by a variety of comparisons and examples. In another place, when explaining these words of the
Psalmist, Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done in heaven and on earth, St. Ambrose says: Although the
species of bread and wine are visible, yet we must believe that after consecration, the body and blood of Christ
are alone there. Explaining the same doctrine almost in the same words, St. Hilary says that although externally
it appear bread and wine, yet in reality it is the body and blood of the Lord.




Why The Eucharist Is Called Bread After Consecration

Here pastors should observe that we should not at all be surprised, if, even after consecration, the Eucharist is
sometimes called bread. It is so called, first because it retains the appearance of bread, and secondly because it
keeps the natural quality of bread, which is to support and nourish the body.



                                                       152
Moreover, such phraseology is in perfect accordance with the usage of the Holy Scriptures, which call things by
what they appear to be, as may be seen from the words of Genesis which say that Abraham saw three men,
when in reality he saw three Angels. In like manner the two Angels who appeared to the Apostles after the
Ascension of Christ the Lord into heaven, are called not Angels, but men.




The Meaning of Transubstantiation

To explain this mystery is extremely difficult. The pastor, however, should endeavour to instruct those who are
more advanced in the knowledge of divine things on the manner of this admirable change. As for those who are
yet weak in faith, they might possibly be overwhelmed by its greatness.




Transubstantiation A Total Conversion

This conversion, then, is so effected that the whole substance of the bread is changed by the power of God into
the whole substance of the body of Christ, and the whole substance of the wine into the whole substance of His
blood, and this, without any change in our Lord Himself. He is neither begotten, nor changed, not increased, but
remains entire in His substance.

This sublime mystery St. Ambrose thus declares: You see how efficacious are the words of Christ. If the word
of the Lord Jesus is so powerful as to summon into existence that which did not exist, namely the world, how
much more powerful is His word to change into something else that which already has existence ?

Many other ancient and most authoritative Fathers have written to the same effect. We faithfully confess, says
St. Augustine, that before consecration it is bread and wine, the product of nature; but after consecration it is the
body and blood of Christ, consecrated by the blessing. The body, says Damascene, is truly united to the
Divinity, that body which was derived from the virgin; not that the body thus derived descends from heaven, but
that the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ.

This admirable change, as the Council of Trent teaches, the Holy Catholic Church most appropriately expresses
by the word transubstantiation. Since natural changes are rightly called transformations, because they involve a
change of form; so likewise our predecessors in the faith wisely and appropriately introduced the term
transubstantiation, in order to signify that in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the whole substance of one thing
passes into the whole substance of another.

According to the admonition so frequently repeated by the holy Fathers, the faithful are to be admonished
against curious searching into the manner in which this change is effected. It defies the powers of conception;
nor can we find any example of it in natural transmutations, or even in the very work of creation. That such a
change takes place must be recognised by faith; how it takes place we must not curiously inquire.

No less of caution should be observed by pastors in explaining the mysterious manner in which the body of our
Lord is contained whole and entire under the least particle of the bread. Indeed, discussions of this kind should
scarcely ever be entered upon. Should Christian charity, however, require a departure from this rule, the pastor
should remember first of all to prepare and fortify his hearers by reminding them that no word shall be
impossible with God.




A Consequence Of Transubstantiation




                                                        153
The pastor should next teach that our Lord is not in the Sacrament as in a place. Place regards things only
inasmuch as they have magnitude. Now we do not say that Christ is in the Sacrament inasmuch as He is great or
small, terms which belong to quantity, but inasmuch as He is a substance. The substance of the bread is changed
into the substance of Christ, not into magnitude or quantity; and substance, it will be acknowledged by all, is
contained in a small as well as in a large space. The substance of air, for instance, and its entire nature must be
present under a small as well as a large quantity, and likewise the entire nature of water must be present no less
in a glass than in a river. Since, then, the body of our Lord succeeds to the substance of the bread, we must
confess it to be in the Sacrament after the same manner as the substance of the bread was before consecration;
whether the substance of the bread was present in greater or less quantity is a matter of entire indifference.




The Mystery of the Accidents without a Subject

We now come to the third great and wondrous effect of this Sacrament, namely, the existence of the species of
bread and wine without a subject.




Proof From The Preceding Dogmas

What has been said in explanation of the two preceding points must facilitate for pastors the exposition of this
truth. For, since we have already proved that the body and blood of our Lord are really and truly contained in
the Sacrament, to the entire exclusion of the substance of the bread and wine, and since the accidents of bread
and wine cannot inhere in the body and blood of Christ, it remains that, contrary to physical laws, they must
subsist of themselves, inhering in no subject.




Proof From The Teaching Of The Church

This has been at all times the uniform doctrine of the Catholic Church; and it can be easily established by the
same authorities which, as we have already proved, make it plain that the substance of the bread and wine
ceases to exist in the Eucharist.




Advantages Of This Mystery

Nothing more becomes the piety of the faithful than, omitting all curious questionings, to revere and adore the
majesty of this august Sacrament, and to recognise the wisdom of God in commanding that these holy mysteries
should be administered under the species of bread and wine. For since it is most revolting to human nature to
eat human flesh or drink human blood, therefore God in His infinite wisdom has established the administration
of the body and blood of Christ under the forms of bread and wine, which are the ordinary and agreeable food
of man.

There are two further advantages: first, it prevents the calumnious reproaches of the unbeliever, from which the
eating of our Lord under His visible form could not easily be defended; secondly, the receiving Him under a
form in which He is impervious to the senses avails much for increasing our faith. For faith, as the well known
saying of St. Gregory declares, has no merit in those things which fall under the proof of reason.

The doctrines treated above should be explained with great caution, according to the capacity of the hearers and
the necessities of the times.


                                                       154
The Effects of the Eucharist

But with regard to the admirable virtue and fruits of this Sacrament, there is no class of the faithful to whom a
knowledge of them is not most necessary. For all that has been said at such length on this Sacrament has
principally for its object, to make the faithful sensible of the advantages of the Eucharist. As, however, no
language can convey an adequate idea of its utility and fruits, pastors must be content to treat of one or two
points, in order to show what an abundance and profusion of all goods are contained in those sacred mysteries.




The Eucharist Contains Christ And Is The Food Of The Soul

This they will in some degree accomplish, if, having explained the efficacy and nature of all the Sacraments,
they compare the Eucharist to a fountain, the other Sacraments to rivulets. For the Holy Eucharist is truly and
necessarily to be called the fountain of all graces, containing, as it does, after an admirable manner, the fountain
itself of celestial gifts and graces, and the author of all the Sacrament, Christ our Lord, from whom, as from its
source, is derived whatever of goodness and perfection the other Sacraments possess. From this (comparison),
therefore, we may easily infer what most ample gifts of divine grace are bestowed on us by this Sacrament.

It will also be useful to consider attentively the nature of bread and wine, which are the symbols of this
Sacrament. For what bread and wine are to the body, the Eucharist is to the health and delight of the soul, but in
a higher and better way. This Sacrament is not, like bread and wine, changed into our substance; but we are, in
some wise, changed into its nature, so that we may well apply here the words of St. Augustine: I am the food of
the frown. Grow and thou shalt eat Me; nor shalt thou change Me into thee, as thy bodily food, but thou shalt be
changed into Me.




The Eucharist Gives Grace

If, then, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, they must surely be poured into the soul which receives with
purity and holiness Him who said of Himself: He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and
I in him. Those who receive this Sacrament piously and fervently must, beyond all doubt, so receive the Son of
God into their souls as to be ingrafted as living members on His body. For it is written: He that eateth me, the
same also shall live by me; also: The bread which I will give is my flesh for the life of the world. Explaining
this passage, St. Cyril says: The Word of God, uniting Himself to His own flesh, imparted to it a vivifying
power: it became Him, therefore, to unite Himself to our bodies in a wonderful manner, through His sacred
flesh and precious blood, which we receive in the bread and wine, consecrated by His vivifying benediction.




The Grace Of The Eucharist Sustains

When it is said that the Eucharist imparts grace, pastors must admonish that this does not mean that the state of
grace is not required for a profitable reception of this Sacrament. For as natural food can be of no use to the
dead, so in like manner the sacred mysteries can evidently be of no avail to a soul which lives not by the spirit.
Hence this Sacrament has been instituted under the forms of bread and wine to signify that the object of its
institution is not to recall the soul to life, but to preserve its life.

The reason, then, for saying that this Sacrament imparts grace, is that even the first grace, with which all should
be clothed before they presume to approach the Holy Eucharist, lest they eat and drink judgment to themselves,'



                                                        155
is given to none unless they receive in wish and desire this very Sacrament. For the Eucharist is the end of all
the Sacraments, and the symbol of unity and brotherhood in the Church, outside which none can attain grace.




The Grace Of The Eucharist Invigorates And Delights

Again, just as the body is not only supported but also increased by natural food, from which the taste every day
derives new relish and pleasure; so also is the soul not only sustained but invigorated by feasting on the food of
the Eucharist, which gives to the spirit an increasing zest for heavenly things. Most truly and fitly therefore do
we say that grace is imparted by this Sacrament, for it may be justly compared to the manna having in it the
sweetness of every taste.




The Eucharist Remits Venial Sins

It cannot be doubted that by the Eucharist are remitted and pardoned lighter sins, commonly called venial.
Whatever the soul has lost through the fire of passion, by falling into some slight offence, all this the Eucharist,
cancelling those lesser faults, repairs, in the same way -- not to depart from the illustration already adduced -- as
natural food gradually restores and repairs the daily waste caused by the force of the vital heat within us. Justly,
therefore, has St. Ambrose said of this heavenly Sacrament: That daily bread is taken as a remedy for daily
infirmity. But these things are to be understood of those sins for which no actual affection is retained.




The Eucharist Strengthens Against Temptation

There is, furthermore, such a power in the sacred mysteries as to preserve us pure and unsullied from sin, keep
us safe from the assaults of temptation, and, as by some heavenly medicine, prepare the soul against the easy
approach and infection of virulent and deadly disease. Hence, as St. Cyprian records, when the faithful were
formerly hurried in multitudes by tyrants to torments and death, because they confessed the name of Christ, it
was an ancient usage in the Catholic Church to give them, by the hands of the Bishop, the Sacrament of the
body and blood of our Lord, lest perhaps overcome by the severity of their sufferings, they should fail in the
fight for salvation.

It also restrains and represses the lusts of the flesh, for while it inflames the soul more ardently with the fire of
charity, it of necessity extinguishes the ardour of concupiscence.




The Eucharist Facilitates The Attainment Of Eternal Life

Finally, to comprise all the advantages and blessings of this Sacrament in one word, it must be taught that the
Holy Eucharist is most efficacious towards the attainment of eternal glory. For it is written: He that eateth my
flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life, and I will raise him up on the last day. That is to say, by the
grace of this Sacrament men enjoy the greatest peace and tranquillity of conscience during the present life; and,
when the hour of departing from this world shall have arrived, like Elias, who in the strength of the bread baked
on the hearth, walked to Horeb, the mount of God, they, too, invigorated by the strengthening influence of this
(heavenly food), will ascend to unfading glory and bliss.




                                                         156
How The Effects Of The Eucharist May Be Developed And Illustrated

All these matters will be most fully expounded by pastors, if they but dwell or. the sixth chapter of St. John, in
which are developed the manifold effects of this Sacrament. Or again, glancing at the admirable actions of
Christ our Lord, they may show that if those who received Him beneath their roof during His mortal life, or
were restored to health by touching His vesture or the hem of His garment, were justly and deservedly deemed
most blessed, how much more fortunate and happy we, into whose soul, resplendent as He is with unfading
glory, He disdains not to enter, to heal all its wounds, to adorn it with His choicest gifts, and unite it to Himself.




Recipient of the Eucharist




Threefold Manner Of Communicating

That the faithful may learn to be zealous for the better gifts, they must be shown who can obtain these abundant
fruits from the Holy Eucharist, must be reminded that there is not only one way of communicating. Wisely and
rightly, then, did our predecessors in the faith, as we read in the Council of Trent, distinguish three ways of
receiving this Sacrament.

Some receive it sacramentally only. Such are those sinners who do not fear to approach the holy mysteries with
polluted lips and heart, who, as the Apostle says, eat and drink the Lord's body unworthily. Of this class of
communicants St. Augustine says: He who dwells not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells not, most certainly
does not eat spiritually His flesh, although carnally and visibly he press with his teeth the Sacrament of His
flesh and blood. Those, therefore, who receive the sacred mysteries with such a disposition, not only obtain no
fruit therefrom, but, as the Apostle himself testifies, eat and drink judgment to themselves.

Others are said to receive the Eucharist in spirit only. They are those who, inflamed with a lively faith which
worketh by charity,' partake in wish and desire of that celestial bread offered to them, from which they receive,
if not the entire, at least very great fruits.

Lastly, there are some who receive the Holy Eucharist both sacramentally and spiritually, those who, according
to the teaching of the Apostle, having first proved themselves and having approached this divine banquet
adorned with the nuptial garment, derive from the Eucharist those most abundant fruits which we have already
described. Hence it is clear that those who, having it in their power to receive with fitting preparation the
Sacrament of the body of the Lord, are yet satisfied with a spiritual Communion only, deprive themselves of the
greatest and most heavenly advantages.




Necessity Of Previous Preparation For Communion

We now come to point out the manner in which the faithful should be previously prepared for sacramental
Communion. To demonstrate the great necessity of this previous preparation, the example of the Saviour should
be adduced. Before He gave to His Apostles the Sacrament of His precious body and blood, although they were
already clean, He washed their feet to show that we must use extreme diligence before Holy Communion in
order to approach it with the greatest purity and innocence of soul.

In the next place, the faithful are to understand that as he who approaches thus prepared and disposed is adorned
with the most ample gifts of heavenly grace; so, on the contrary, he who approaches without this preparation not
only derives from it no advantage, but even incurs the greatest misfortune and loss. It is characteristic of the



                                                         157
best and most salutary things that, if seasonably made use of, they are productive of the greatest benefit; but if
employed out of time, they prove most pernicious and destructive. It cannot, therefore, excite out surprise that
the great and exalted gifts of God; when received into a soul properly disposed, are of the greatest assistance
towards the attainment of salvation; while to those who receive them unworthily, they bring with them eternal
death.

Of this the Ark of the Lord affords a convincing illustration. The people of Israel possessed nothing more
precious and it was to them the source of innumerable blessings from God; but when the Philistines carried it
away, it brought on them a most destructive plague and the heaviest calamities, together with eternal disgrace.
Thus also food when received from the mouth into a healthy stomach nourishes and supports the body; but
when received into an indisposed stomach, causes grave disorders.




Preparation Of Soul

The first preparation, then, which the faithful should make, is to distinguish table from table, this sacred table
from profane tables, this celestial bread from common bread. This we do when we firmly believe that there is
truly present the body and blood of the Lord, of Him whom the Angels adore in heaven, at whose nod the pillars
of heaven fear and tremble, of whose glory the heavens and the earth are full. This is to discern the body of the
Lord in accordance with the admonition of the Apostle. We should venerate the greatness of the mystery rather
than too curiously investigate its truth by idle inquiry.

Another very necessary preparation is to ask ourselves if we are at peace with and sincerely love our neigh r. If,
therefore, thou offerest thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath anything against thee,
leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt
offer thy gift.

We should, in the next place, carefully examine whether our consciences be defiled by mortal sin, which has to
be repented of, in order that it may be blotted out before Communion by the remedy of contrition and
confession. The Council of Trent has defined that no one conscious of mortal sin and having an opportunity of
going to confession, however contrite he may deem himself, is to approach the Holy Eucharist until he has been
purified by sacramental confession.

We should also reflect in the silence of our own hearts how unworthy we are that the Lord should bestow on us
this divine gift, and with the centurion of whom our Lord declared that he found not so great faith in Israel, we
should exclaim from our hearts: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof.

We should also put the question to ourselves whether we can truly say with Peter: Lord, thou knowest that I
love thee, and should recollect that he who sat down at the banquet of the Lord without a wedding garment was
cast into a dark dungeon and condemned to eternal torments.




Preparation Of Body

Our preparation should not, however, be confined to the soul; it should also extend to the body. We are to
approach the Holy Table fasting, having neither eaten nor drunk anything at least from the preceding midnight
until the moment of Communion.

The dignity of so great a Sacrament also demands that married persons abstain from the marriage debt for some
days previous to Communion. This observance is recommended by the example of David, who, when about to




                                                        158
receive the show-bread from the hands of the priest, declared that he and his servants had been clean from
women for three days.

The above are the principal things to be done by the faithful preparatory to receiving the sacred mysteries with
profit; and to these heads may be reduced whatever other things may seem desirable by way of preparation.




The Obligation of Communion




How Often Must Communion Be Received?

Lest any be kept away from Communion by the fear that the requisite preparation is too hard and laborious, the
faithful are frequently to be reminded that they are all bound to receive the Holy Eucharist. Furthermore, the
Church has decreed that whoever neglects to approach Holy Communion once a year, at Easter, is liable to
sentence of excommunication.




The Church Desires The Faithful To Communicate Daily

However, let not the faithful imagine that it is enough to receive the body of the Lord once a year only, in
obedience to the decree of the Church. They should approach oftener; but whether monthly, weekly, or daily,
cannot be decided by any fixed universal rule. St. Augustine, however, lays down a most certain norm: Live in
such a manner as to be able to receive every day.

It will therefore be the duty of the pastor frequently to admonish the faithful that, as they deem it necessary to
afford daily nutriment to the body, they should also feel solicitous to feed and nourish the soul every day with
this heavenly food. It is clear that the soul stands not less in need of spiritual, than the body of corporal food.
Here it will be found most useful to recall the inestimable and divine advantages which, as we have already
shown, flow from sacramental Communion. It will be well also to refer to the manna, which was a figure (of
this Sacrament), and which refreshed the bodily powers every day. The Fathers who earnestly recommended the
frequent reception of this Sacrament may also be cited. The words of St. Augustine, Thou sinnest daily, receive
daily, express not his opinion only, but that of all the Fathers who have written on the subject, as anyone may
easily discover who will carefully read them.

That there was a time when the faithful approached Holy Communion every day we learn from the Acts of the
Apostles. All who then professed the faith of Christ burned with such true and sincere charity that, devoting
themselves to prayer and other works of piety, they were found prepared to communicate daily. This devout
practice, which seems to have been interrupted for a time, was again partially revived by the holy Pope and
martyr Anacletus, who commanded that all the ministers who assisted at the Sacrifice of the Mass should
communicate-an ordinance, as the Pontiff declares, of Apostolic institution. It was also for a long time the
practice of the Church that, as soon as the Sacrifice was complete, and when the priest himself had
communicated, he turned to the congregation and invited the faithful to the Holy Table in these words: Come,
brethren, and receive Communion; and thereupon those who were prepared, advanced to receive the holy
mysteries with the most fervent devotion.




The Church Commands; The Faithful To Communicate Once A Year




                                                       159
But subsequently, when charity and devotion had grown so cold that the faithful very seldom approached
Communion, it was decreed by Pope Fabian, that all should communicate thrice every year, at Christmas, at
Easter and at Pentecost. This decree was afterwards confirmed by many Councils, particularly by the first of
Agde.

Such at length was the decay of piety that not only was this holy and salutary law unobserved, but Communion
was deferred for years. The Council of Lateran, therefore, decreed that all the faithful should receive the sacred
body of the Lord, at least once a year, at Easter, and that neglect of this duty should be chastised by exclusion
from the society of the faithful.




Who Are Obliged By The Law Of Communion

But although this law, sanctioned by the authority of God and of His Church, concerns all the faithful, it should
be taught that it does not extend to those who on account of their tender age have not attained the use of reason.
For these are not able to distinguish the Holy Eucharist from common and ordinary bread and cannot bring with
them to this Sacrament piety and devotion. Furthermore (to extend the precept to them) would appear
inconsistent with the ordinance of our Lord, for He said: Take and eat - words which cannot apply to infants,
who are evidently incapable of taking and eating.

In some places, it is true, an ancient practice prevailed of giving the Holy Eucharist even to infants; but, for the
reasons already assigned, and for other reasons in keeping with Christian piety, this practice has been long
discontinued by authority of the Church.

With regard to the age at which children should be given the holy mysteries, this the parents and confessor can
best determine. To them it belongs to inquire and to ascertain from the children themselves whether they have
some knowledge of this admirable Sacrament and whether they desire to receive it.

Communion must not be given to persons who are insane and incapable of devotion. However, according to the
decree of the Council of Carthage, it may be administered to them at the close of life, provided they have
shown, before losing their minds, a pious and religious disposition, and no danger, arising from the state of the
stomach or other inconvenience or disrespect, is likely.




The Rite of Administering Communion

As to the rite to be observed in communicating, pastors should teach that the law of the holy Church forbids
Communion under both kinds to anyone but the officiating priests, without the authority of the Church itself.

Christ the Lord, it is true, as has been explained by the Council of Trent, instituted and delivered to His
Apostles at His Last Supper this most sublime Sacrament under the species of bread and wine; but it does not
follow that by doing so our Lord and Saviour established a law ordering its administration to all the faithful
under both species. For speaking of this Sacrament, He Himself frequently mentions it under one kind only, as,
for instance, when He says: If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, and: The bread that I will give is
my flesh for the life of the world, and: He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.




Why The Celebrant Alone Receives Under Both Species




                                                        160
It is clear that the Church was influenced by numerous and most cogent reasons, not only to approve, but also to
confirm by authority of its decree, the general practice of communicating under one species. In the first place,
the greatest caution was necessary to avoid spilling the blood of the Lord on the ground, a thing that seemed not
easily to be avoided, if the chalice were administered in a large assemblage of the people.

In the next place, whereas the Holy Eucharist ought to be in readiness for the sick, it was very much to be
apprehended, were the species of wine to remain long unconsumed, that it might turn acid.

Besides, there are many who cannot at all bear the taste or even the smell of wine. Lest, therefore, what is
intended for the spiritual health should prove hurtful to the health of the body, it has been most prudently
provided by the Church that it should be administered to the people under the species of bread only.

We may also further observe that in many countries wine is extremely scarce; nor can it, moreover, be brought
from elsewhere without incurring very heavy expenses and encountering very tedious and difficult journeys.

Finally, a most important reason was the necessity of opposing the heresy of those who denied that Christ,
whole and entire, is contained under either species, and asserted that the body is contained under the species of
bread without the blood, and the blood under the species of wine without the body. In order, therefore, to place
more clearly before the eyes of all the truth of the Catholic faith, Communion under one kind, that is, under the
species of bread, was most wisely introduced.

There are also other reasons, collected by those who have treated on this subject, and which, if it shall appear
necessary, can be brought forward by pastors.




The Minister of the Eucharist

To omit nothing doctrinal on this Sacrament, we now come to speak of its minister, a point, however. on which
scarcely anyone can be ignorant.




Only Priests Have Power To Consecrate And Administer The Eucharist

It must be taught, then, that to priests alone has been given power to consecrate and administer to the faithful,
the Holy Eucharist. That this has been the unvarying practice of the Church, that the faithful should receive the
Sacrament from the priests, and that the officiating priests should communicate themselves, has been explained
by the holy Council of Trent, which has also shown that this practice, as having proceeded from Apostolic
tradition, is to be religiously retained, particularly as Christ the Lord has left us an illustrious example thereof,
having consecrated His own most sacred body, and given it to the Apostles with His own hands.




The Laity Prohibited To Touch The Sacred Vessels

To safeguard in every possible way the dignity of so august a Sacrament, not only is the power of its
administration entrusted exclusively to priests, but the Church has also prohibited by law any but consecrated
persons, unless some case of great necessity intervene, to dare handle or touch the sacred vessels, the linen, or
other instruments necessary to its completion.

Priests themselves and the rest of the faithful may hence understand how great should be the piety and holiness
of those who approach to consecrate, administer or receive the Eucharist.


                                                        161
The Unworthiness Of The Minister Does Not Invalidate The Sacrament

What, however, has been already said of the other Sacraments, holds good also with regard to the Sacrament of
the Eucharist; namely, that a Sacrament is validly administered even by the wicked, provided all the essentials
have been duly observed. For we are to believe that all these depend not on the merit of the minister, but are
operated by the virtue and power of Christ our Lord.

These are the things necessary to be explained regarding the Eucharist as a Sacrament.




The Eucharist as a Sacrifice

We must now proceed to explain its nature as a Sacrifice, that pastors may understand what are the principal
instructions which they ought to impart to the faithful on Sundays and holy days, regarding this mystery in
conformity with the decree of the holy Council (of Trent).




Importance Of Instruction On The Mass

This Sacrament is not only a treasure of heavenly riches, which if turned to good account will obtain for us the
grace and love of God; but it also possesses a peculiar character, by which we are enabled to make some return
to God for the immense benefits bestowed upon us.

How grateful and acceptable to God is this victim, if duly and legitimately immolated, is inferred from the
following consideration. Of the sacrifices of the Old Law it is written: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldst not;
and again: If thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with burnt-offerings thou wilt not be
delighted. Now if these were so pleasing in the Lord's sight that, as the Scripture testifies, from them God
smelled a sweet savour, that is to say, they were grateful and acceptable to Him; what have we not to hope from
that Sacrifice in which is immolated and offered He Himself of whom a voice from heaven twice proclaimed:
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

This mystery, therefore, pastors should carefully explain, so that when the faithful are assembled at the
celebration of divine service, they may learn to meditate with attention and devotion on the sacred things at
which they are present.




Distinction of Sacrament and Sacrifice

They should teach, then, in the first place, that the Eucharist was instituted by Christ for two purposes: one, that
it might be the heavenly food of our souls, enabling us to support and preserve spiritual life; and the other, that
the Church might have a perpetual Sacrifice, by which our sins might be expiated, and our heavenly Father,
oftentimes grievously offended by our crimes, might be turned away from wrath to mercy, from the severity of
just chastisement to clemency. Of this thing we may observe a type and resemblance in the Paschal lamb, which
was wont to be offered and eaten by the children of Israel as a sacrament and a sacrifice.

Nor could our Saviour, when about to offer Himself to God the Father on the altar of the cross, have given any
more illustrious indication of His unbounded love towards us than by bequeathing to us a visible Sacrifice, by
which that bloody Sacrifice, which was soon after to be offered once on the cross, would be renewed, and its


                                                       162
memory daily celebrated with the greatest utility, unto the consummation of ages by the Church diffused
throughout the world.

But (between the Eucharist as a Sacrament and a Sacrifice) the difference is very great; for as a Sacrament it is
perfected by consecration; as a Sacrifice, all its force consists in its oblation. When, therefore, kept in a pyx, or
borne to the sick, it is a Sacrament, not a Sacrifice. As a Sacrament also, it is to them that receive it a source of
merit, and brings with it all those advantages which have been already mentioned; but as a Sacrifice, it is not
only a source of merit, but also of satisfaction. For as, in His Passion, Christ the Lord merited and satisfied for
us; so also those who offer this Sacrifice, by which they communicate with us, merit the fruit of His Passion,
and satisfy.




The Mass Is a True Sacrifice




Proof From The Council Of Trent

With regard to the institution of this Sacrifice, the holy Council of Trent has left no room for doubt, by
declaring that it was instituted by our Lord at His Last Supper; while it condemns under anathema all those who
assert that in it is not offered to God a true and proper Sacrifice; or that to offer means nothing else than that
Christ is given as our spiritual food.

Nor did (the Council) omit carefully to explain that to God alone is offered this Sacrifice. For although the
Church sometimes offers Masses in honour and in memory of the Saints, yet she teaches that the Sacrifice is
offered, not to them, but to God alone, who has crowned the Saints with immortal glory. Hence the priest never
says: I offer Sacrifice to thee Peter, or to thee Paul; but, while he offers Sacrifice to God alone, he renders Him
thanks for the signal victory won by the blessed martyrs, and thus implores their patronage, that they, whose
memory we celebrate on earth, may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven."




Proof From Scripture

This doctrine, handed down by the Catholic Church, concerning the truth of this Sacrifice, she received from the
words of our Lord, when, on that last night, committing to His Apostles these same sacred mysteries, He said:
Do this for a commemoration of me; for then, as was defined by the holy Council, He ordained them priests,
and commanded that they and their successors in the priestly office, should immolate and offer His body.

Of this the words of the Apostle to the Corinthians also afford a sufficient proof: You cannot drink the chalice
of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the? table of
devils. As then by the table of devils must be understood the altar on which sacrifice was offered to them; so
also - if the conclusion proposed to himself by the Apostle is to be legitimately drawn -- by the table of the Lord
can be understood nothing else than the altar on which Sacrifice was offered to the Lord.

Should we look for figures and prophecies of this Sacrifice in the Old Testament, in the first place Malachy
most clearly prophesied thereof in these words: From the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is
great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation:
for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.

Moreover, this victim was foretold, as well before as after the promulgation of the Law, by various kinds of
sacrifices; for this victim alone, as the perfection and completion of all, comprises all the blessings which were



                                                         163
signified by the other sacrifices. In nothing, however, do we behold a more lively image of the Eucharistic
Sacrifice than in that of Melchisedech; for the Saviour Himself offered to God the Father, at His Last Supper,
His body and blood, under the appearances of bread and wine, declaring that He was constituted a priest for
ever, after the order of Melchisedech.




Excellence of the Mass




The Mass Is The Same Sacrifice As That Of The Cross

We therefore confess that the Sacrifice of the Mass is and ought to be considered one and the same Sacrifice as
that of the cross, for the victim is one and the same, namely, Christ our Lord, who offered Himself, once only, a
bloody Sacrifice on the altar of the cross. The bloody and unbloody victim are not two, but one victim only,
whose Sacrifice is daily renewed in the Eucharist, in obedience to the command of our Lord: Do this for a
commemoration of me.

The priest is also one and the same, Christ the Lord; for the ministers who offer Sacrifice, consecrate the holy
mysteries, not in their own person, but in that of Christ, as the words of consecration itself show, for the priest
does not say: This is the body of Christ, but, This is my body; and thus, acting in the Person of Christ the Lord,
he changes the substance of the bread and wine into the true substance of His body and blood.




The Mass A Sacrifice Of Praise, Thanksgiving And Propitiation

This being the case, it must be taught without any hesitation that, as the holy Council (of Trent) has also)
explained, the sacred and holy Sacrifice of the Mass is not a Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving only, or a mere
commemoration of the Sacrifice performed on the cross, but also truly a propitiatory Sacrifice, by which God is
appeased and rendered propitious to us. If, therefore, with a pure heart, a lively faith, and affected with an
inward sorrow for our transgressions, we immolate and offer this most holy victim, we shall, without doubt,
obtain mercy from the Lord, and grace in time of need; for SO delighted is the Lord with the door of this victim
that, bestowing on us the gift of grace and repentance, He pardons our sins. Hence this usual prayer of the
Church: As often as the commemoration of this victim is celebrated, so often is the work of our salvation being
done; that is to say, through this unbloody Sacrifice flow to us the most plenteous fruits of that bloody victim.




The Mass Profits Both The Living And The Dead

Pastors should next teach that such is the efficacy of this Sacrifice that its benefits extend not only to the
celebrant and communicant, but to all the faithful, whether living with us on earth, or already numbered with
those who are dead in the Lord, but whose sins have not yet been fully expiated. For, according to the most
authentic Apostolic tradition, it is not less available when offered for them, than when offered for the sins of the
living, their punishments, satisfactions, calamities and difficulties of every sort.

It is hence easy to perceive, that all Masses, as being conducive to the common interest and salvation of all the
faithful, are to be considered common to all.




                                                        164
The Rites and ceremonies of the Mass

The Sacrifice (of the Mass) is celebrated with many solemn rites and ceremonies, none of which should be
deemed useless or superfluous. On the contrary, all of them tend to display the majesty of this august Sacrifice,
and to excite the faithful when beholding these saving mysteries, to contemplate the divine things which lie
concealed in the Eucharistic Sacrifice. On these rites and ceremonies we shall not dwell, since they require a
more lengthy exposition than is compatible with the nature of the present work; moreover priests can easily
consult on the subject some of the many booklets and works that have been written by pious and learned men.

What has been said so far will, with the divine assistance, be found sufficient to explain the principal things
which regard the Holy Eucharist both as a Sacrament and Sacrifice.




                                      THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE




Importance Of Instruction On This Sacrament

As the frailty and weakness of human nature are universally known and felt by each one in himself, no one can
be ignorant of the great necessity of the Sacrament of Penance. If, there- fore, the diligence of pastors should be
proportioned to the weight and importance of the subject, we must admit that in ex pounding this Sacrament
they can never be sufficiently diligent. Nay, it should be explained with more care than Baptism. Baptism is
administered but once, and cannot be repeated; Penance may be administered and becomes necessary, as often
as we may have sinned after Baptism. Hence the- Council of Trent declares: For those who fall into sin after
Baptism the Sacrament of Penance is as necessary to salvation as is Baptism for those who have not been
already baptised. The saying of St. Jerome that Penance is a second plank, is universally known and highly
commended by all subsequent writers on sacred things. As he who suffers shipwreck has no hope of safety,
unless, perchance, he seize on some plank from the wreck, so he that suffers the shipwreck of baptismal
innocence, unless he cling to the saving plank of Penance, has doubtless lost all hope of salvation.

These instructions are intended not only for the benefit of pastors, but also for that of the faithful at large, to
awaken attention, lest they be found culpably negligent in a matter so very important. Impressed with a just
sense of the frailty of human nature, their first and most earnest desire should be to advance with the divine
assistance in the ways of God, without sin or failing. But should they at any time prove so unfortunate as to fall,
then, looking at the infinite goodness of God, who like the good shepherd binds up and heals the wounds of His
sheep, they should not postpone recourse to the most saving remedy of Penance.




Different Meanings of the Word "Penance"

To enter at once on the subject, and to avoid all error to which the ambiguity of the word may give rise, its
different meanings are first to be explained. By penance some understand satisfaction; while others, who
wander far from the doctrine of the Catholic faith, supposing penance to have no reference to the past, define it
to be nothing more than newness of life. It must, therefore, be shown that the word has a variety of meanings.

In the first place, it is said of those to whom that which was before pleasing is now displeasing, whether the
object itself was good or bad. In this sense all those repent whose sorrow is according to the world, not
according to God; and therefore, worketh not salvation, but death.




                                                       165
In the second place, it is used to express that sorrow which the sinner conceives, not, however, for the sake of
God, but for his own sake, concerning some sin of his in which he once took pleasure.

A third kind of penance is that by which we experience interior sorrow of heart, or give exterior indication of
such sorrow for the sake of God alone. To all these kinds of sorrow the word repentance properly applies.

When the Sacred Scriptures say that God repented, the expression is evidently figurative. When we repent of
any thing, we are most anxious to change it; and hence when God has resolved to change any thing, the
Scriptures, accommodating their language to our manner of speaking, say that He repents. Thus we read that it
repented him that he had made man, and also that He was sorry that He had made Saul king.

But an important distinction is to be made between these different significations of the word. The first kind of
penance must be considered faulty; the second is only the agitation of a disturbed mind; the third we call both a
virtue and a Sacrament. In this last sense penance is taken here.




The Virtue of Penance

We shall first treat of penance as a virtue, not only because it is the duty of the pastor to lead the faithful to the
practice of every virtue; but also, because the acts which proceed from penance as a virtue, constitute the
matter, as it were, of Penance as a Sacrament, and unless the virtue be rightly understood, the force of the
Sacrament cannot be appreciated.

The faithful, therefore, are first to be admonished and exhorted to labor strenuously to attain this interior
penance of the heart which we call a virtue, and without which exterior penance can avail them very little.




Meaning Of Penance

Interior penance consists in turning to God sincerely and from heart, and in hating and detesting our past
transgressions, with a firm resolution of amendment of life, hoping to obtain pardon through the mercy.
Accompanying this penance, like inseparable companion of detestation for sin, is a sorrow and sadness, which
is a certain agitation and disturbance of the soul, and is called by many a passion. Hence many of the Fathers
define penance as an anguish of soul.

Penance, however, in those who repent, must be preceded by faith, for without faith no man can turn to God.
Faith, therefore, cannot on any account be called a part of penance.




Penance Proved To Be A Virtue

That this inward penance is, as we have already said, a virtue, the various commands which have been given
regarding it clearly show; for the law commands only those actions that are virtuous.

Furthermore, no one can deny that it is a virtue to be sorrowful at the time, in the manner, and to the extent
which are required. To regulate sorrow in this manner belongs to the virtue of penance. Some conceive a sorrow
which bears no proportion to their crimes. Nay, there are some, says Solomon, who are glad when they have
done evil. Others, on the contrary, give themselves to such melancholy and grief, as utterly to abandon all hope
of salvation. Such, perhaps, was the condition of Cain when he exclaimed: My iniquity is greater than that I
may deserve pardon. Such certainly was the condition of Judas, who, repenting, hanged himself, and thus lost


                                                         166
soul and body. Penance, therefore, considered as a virtue, assists us in restraining within the bounds of
moderation our sense of sorrow.

That penance is a virtue may also be inferred from the ends which the true penitent proposes to himself. The
first is to destroy sin and efface from the soul its every spot and stain. The second is to make satisfaction to God
for the sins which he has committed, which is clearly an act of justice. Between God and man, it is true, no
relation of strict justice can exist, so great is the distance that separates them; yet between them there is
evidently a sort of justice, such as exists between a father and his children, between a master and his servants.
The third (end of the penitent) is to reinstate himself in the favour and friendship of God whom he has offended
and whose hatred he has earned by the turpitude of sin. The foregoing considerations sufficiently prove that
penance is a virtue.




The Steps Which Lead Up To This Virtue

We must also point out the steps by which we may ascend to this divine virtue. I The mercy of God first goes
before us and converts our hearts to Him. This was the object of the Prophet's prayer: Convert us, O Lord, to
thee, and we shall be converted.

Illumined by this light the soul next tends to God by faith. He that cometh to God, says the Apostle, must
believe that he is, and is a rewarder of them that seek him.

A salutary fear of God's judgments follows, and the soul, contemplating the punishments that await sin, is
recalled from the paths of vice. To this (state of soul) seem to refer these words of Isaias: As a woman with
child, when she draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs, so are we become.

Then follows a hope of obtaining mercy from God, encouraged by which we resolve on improvement of life.

Lastly, our hearts are inflamed by charity, whence springs that filial fear which good and dutiful children
experience; and thus dreading only to offend the majesty of God in anything, we entirely abandon the ways of
sin.




Fruits Of This Virtue

Such are, as it were, the steps by which we ascend to this most exalted virtue, a virtue altogether heavenly and
divine, to which the Sacred Scriptures promise the kingdom of heaven; for it is written in St. Matthew: Do
penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. If, says Ezechiel, the wicked do penance for all his sins which he
hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment and justice, living he shall live. In another
place: I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, words which are
evidently understood of eternal life.




Penance as a Sacrament

Regarding external penance it will be necessary to show that in it the Sacrament properly consists, and that it
possesses certain outward and sensible signs which denote the effect that takes place interiorly in the soul.




                                                        167
Why Christ Instituted This Sacrament

In the first place, however, it will be well to explain why it is that Christ our Lord was pleased to number
Penance among the Sacraments. One of His reasons certainly was to leave us no room for doubt regarding the
remission of sin which was promised by God when He said: If the wicked do penance, etc. For each one has
good reason to distrust the accuracy of his own judgment on his own actions, and hence we could not but be
very much in doubt regarding the truth of our internal penance. It was to destroy this, our uneasiness, that our
Lord instituted the Sacrament of Penance, by means of which we are assured that our sins are pardoned by the
absolution of the priest; and also to tranquilize our conscience by means of the trust we rightly repose in the
virtue of the Sacraments. The words of the priest sacramentally and lawfully absolving us from our sins are to
be accepted in the same sense as the words of Christ our Lord when He said to the paralytic: Son, be of good
heart: thy sins are forgiven thee.

In the second place, no one can obtain salvation unless through Christ and the merits of His Passion. Hence it
was becoming in itself, and highly advantageous to us, that a Sacrament should be instituted through the force
and efficacy of which the blood of Christ flows into our souls, washes- away-all the sins committed after
Baptism, and thus leads us to recognise that it is to our Saviour alone we owe the blessing of reconciliation.




Penance Is a Sacrament

That Penance is a Sacrament pastors can easily show from what follows. As Baptism is a Sacrament because it
blots out all sins, and especially original sin, so for the same reason Penance, which takes away all the sins of
thought and deed committed after Baptism, must be regarded as a true Sacrament in the proper sense of the
word.

Moreover -- and this is the principal reason -- since what is exteriorly done, both by priest and penitent,
signifies the inward effects that take place in the soul, who will venture to deny that Penance is invested with
the nature of a proper and true Sacrament ? For a Sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing. Now the sinner who
repents plainly expresses by his words and actions that he has turned his heart from sin; while from the words
and actions of the priest we easily recognise the mercy of God exercised in the remission of sins.

In any event, the words of our Saviour furnish a clear proof: I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven. The absolution announced in the
words of the priest expresses the remission of sins which it accomplishes in the soul.




This Sacrament May Be Repeated

The faithful should be instructed not only that Penance is to be numbered among the Sacraments, but that it is
one of the Sacraments which may be repeated. To Peter, who had asked whether pardon could be given to sin
seven times, our Lord replied: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven.

If, then, (the pastor) happens to encounter those who seem to distrust the infinite goodness and clemency of
God, let him endeavour to inspire their minds with confidence, and raise them up to the hope of obtaining the
grace of God. He will easily accomplish this object by explaining the above and other passages which are
frequently met with in Holy Writ; as well as by using the arguments and reasons which may be found in St.
Chrysostom's book On the Lapsed, and St. Ambrose's books On Penance.




                                                       168
The Constituent Parts of Penance




The Matter

There is nothing that should be better known to the faithful than the matter of this Sacrament; hence they should
be taught that Penance differs from the other Sacraments in this that while the matter of the other Sacraments is
some thing, whether natural or artificial, the matter, as it were, of the Sacrament of Penance is the acts of the
penitent, -- namely, contrition, confession and satisfaction, -- as has been declared by the council of Trent. Now,
inasmuch as these acts are by divine institution required on the part of the penitent for the integrity of the
Sacrament, and for the full and perfect remission of sin, they are called parts of Penance. It is not because they
are not the real matter that they are called by the Council the matter as it were, but because they are not of that
sort of matter which is applied externally, such, for instance, as water in Baptism and chrism in Confirmation.

As regards the opinion of some who hold that sins themselves are the matter of this Sacrament, it will be found,
when carefully examined, that it does not really differ from the explanation already given. Thus we say that
wood which is consumed by fire is the matter of fire. In the same way, sins which are destroyed by Penance
may properly be called the matter of Penance.




The Form Of Penance

Pastors should not neglect to explain the form of the Sacrament of Penance. A knowledge of it will excite the
faithful to receive the grace of this Sacrament with the greatest possible devotion. Now the form is: I absolve
thee, as may be inferred not only from the words, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall be bound also in
heaven, but also from the teaching of Christ our Lord, handed down to us by the Apostles.

Moreover, since the Sacraments signify what they effect, the words, I absolve thee, signify that remission of sin
is effected by the administration of this Sacrament; and hence it is plain that such is the perfect form of the
Sacrament. For sins are, so to say, the chains by which the soul is bound, and from which it is freed by the
Sacrament of Penance. And none the less truly does the priest pronounce the form over the penitent who,
through perfect contrition, accompanied by the desire of confession, has already obtained remission of his sins
from God.

Several prayers are added, not that they are necessary to the form, but in order to remove every obstacle that can
impede the force and efficacy of the Sacrament owing to the fault of him to whom it is administered.

How thankful, then, should not sinners be to God for having bestowed such ample power on the priests of His
Church ! Unlike the priests of the Old Law who merely declared the leper cleansed from his leprosy, the power
now given to the priests of the New Law is not limited to declaring the sinner absolved from his sins, but, as a
minister of God, he truly absolves from sin. This is an effect of which God Himself, the author and source of
grace and justice, is the principal cause.




The Rites Observed in the Sacrament of Penance

The faithful should take great care to observe the rites which accompany the administration o f this Sacrament.
In this way they will have a higher idea of what they obtain from this Sacrament, that is, that they have been
reconciled as slaves to their kind master, or rather, as children to their best of fathers; and at the same time they




                                                        169
will also better understand what is the duty of those who desire, as everyone should, to show their gratitude and
remembrance of so great a benefit.

The sinner, then, who repents, casts himself humbly and sorrowfully at the feet of the priest, in order that by
there humbling himself he may the more easily be led to see that he must tear up the roots of pride whence
spring and flourish all the sins he now deplores. In the priest, who is his legitimate judge, he venerates the
person and the power of Christ our Lord; for in the administration of the Sacrament of Penance, as in that of the
other Sacraments, the priest holds the place of Christ. Next the penitent enumerates his sins, acknowledging, at
the same time, that he deserves the greatest and severest chastisements; and finally, suppliantly asks pardon for
his faults.

All these rites have a sure guarantee for their antiquity in the authority of St. Denis.




Effects of the Sacrament of Penance

Nothing will prove of greater advantage to the faithful, nothing will be found to conduce more to a willing
reception of the Sacrament of Penance, than for pastors to explain frequently the great advantage to be derived
therefrom. They will then see that of Penance it is truly said that its roots ale bitter, but its fruit sweet indeed.

First of all, then, the great efficacy o Penance consists in this, that it restores us to the grace of God, and unites
us to Him in the closest friendship.

In pious souls who approach this Sacrament with devotion, profound peace and tranquillity of conscience,
together with ineffable joy of soul, accompany this reconciliation. For there is no sin, however great or horrible,
which cannot be effaced by the Sacrament of Penance, and that not merely once, but over and over again. On
this point God Himself thus speaks through the Prophet: If the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath
committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die,
and I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done. And St. John says: If we confess our sins; he is
faithful and just, to forgive us our sins; and a little later, he adds: If any man sin, -- he excepts no sin whatever, -
- we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just; for he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.

When we read in Scripture that certain persons did not obtain pardon from God, even though they earnestly
implored it, we know that this was due to the fact that they had not a true and heartfelt sorrow for their sins.
Thus when we find in Sacred Scripture and in the writings of the Fathers passages which seem to assert that
certain sins are irremissible, we must understand the meaning to be that it is very difficult to obtain pardon for
them. A disease is sometimes called incurable, because the patient is so disposed as to loathe the medicines that
could afford him relief. Ill the same way certain sins are not remitted or pardoned because the sinner rejects the
grace of God, the only medicine for salvation. It is in this sense that St. Augustine wrote: When a man who,
through the grace of Jesus Christ, has once arrived at a knowledge of God, wounds fraternal charity, and, driven
by the fury of envy, lifts up his head against grace, the enormity of his sin is so great that, though compelled by
a guilty conscience to acknowledge and confess his fault, he finds himself unable to submit to the humiliation of
imploring pardon.




The Necessity of the Sacrament of Penance

Returning now to the Sacrament, it is so much the special province of Penance to remit sins that it is impossible
to obtain or even to hope for remission of sins by any other means; for it is written: Unless you do penance, you
shall all likewise perish. These words were said by our Lord in reference to grievous and mortal sins, although



                                                         170
at the same time lighter sins, which are called venial, also require some sort of penance. St. Augustine observes
that the kind of penance which is daily performed in the Church for venial sins, would be absolutely useless, if
venial sin could be remitted without penance.




The Three Integral Parts of Penance

But as it is not enough to speak in general terms when treating of practical matters, the pastors should take care
to explain, one by one, those things from which the faithful can understand the meaning of true and salutary
Penance.




Their Existence

Now it is peculiar to this Sacrament that besides matter and form, which it has in common with all the other
Sacraments, it has also, as we have said, those parts which constitute Penance, so to say, whole and entire;
namely, contrition, confession and satisfaction. On these St. Chrysostom thus speaks: Penance enables the
sinner to bear all willingly in his heart is contrition; on his lips confession; in his actions entire humility or
salutary satisfaction.




Their Nature

These three parts belong to that class of parts which are necessary to constitute a whole. The human body is
composed of many members, -- -hands, feet, eyes and the various other parts; the want of any one of which
makes the body be justly considered imperfect, while if none of them is missing, the body is regarded as perfect.
In the same way, Penance is composed of these three parts in such a way that though contrition and confession,
which justify man, are alone required to constitute its essence, yet, unless accompanied by its third part,
satisfaction, it necessarily remains short of its absolute perfection.

These three parts, then, are so intimately connected with one another, that contrition includes the intention and
resolution of confessing and making satisfaction; contrition and the resolution of making satisfaction imply
confession; while the other two precede satisfaction.




Necessity Of These Integral Parts

The reason why these are the integral parts may be thus explained. Sins against God are committed by thought,
by word and by deed. It is, then, but reasonable, that in recurring to the power of the keys we should endeavour
to appease God's wrath, and obtain pardon for our sins by means of the very same things which we employed to
offend His sovereignty.

A further reason by way of confirmation can also be assigned. Penance is a sort of compensation for sin,
springing from the free will of the delinquent, and is appointed by God, against whom the offence has been
committed. Hence, on the one hand, there is required the willingness to make compensation, in which
willingness contrition chiefly consists; while, on the other hand, the penitent must submit himself to the
judgment of the priest, who holds God's place, in order to enable him to award a punishment proportioned to the
gravity of the sin committed. Hence the reason for and the necessity of confession and satisfaction are easily
inferred.


                                                         171
The First Part of Penance




Contrition

As the faithful require instruction on the nature and efficacy of the parts of Penance, we must begin with
contrition. This subject demands careful explanation; for as often as we call to mind our past transgressions, or
offend God anew, so often should our hearts be pierced with contrition.




The Meaning Of Contrition

By the Fathers of the Council of Trent, contrition is defined: A sorrow and detestation for sin committed, with a
purpose of sinning no more. and a little further on the Council, speaking of the motion of the will to contrition,
adds: If joined with a confidence in the mercy of God and an earnest desire of per forming whatever is
necessary to the proper reception of the Sacrament, it thus prepares us for the remission of sin.




Contrition Is A Detestation Of Sin

From this definition, therefore, the faithful will perceive that the efficacy of contrition does not simply consist
in ceasing to sin, or in resolving to begin, or having actually begun a new life; it supposes first of all a hatred of
one's ill-spent life and a desire of atoning for past transgressions.

This is especially confirmed by those cries of the holy Fathers,. which we so frequently meet with in Holy
Scripture. I have laboured in my groaning, says David; every night I will wash my bed; and again, The Lord
hath heard the voice of my weeping. I will recount to thee all my years, says another, in the bitterness of my
soul. These and many like expressions were called forth by an intense hatred and a lively detestation of past
transgressions.




Contrition Produces Sorrow

But although contrition is defined as sorrow, the faithful are not thence to conclude that this sorrow consists in
sensible feeling; for contrition is an act of the will, and, as St. Augustine observes, grief is not penance but the
accompaniment of penance. By sorrow the Fathers understood a hatred and detestation of sin; in the first place,
because the Sacred Scriptures frequently use the word in this sense. How long, says David, shall I take counsels
in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day. And secondly, because from contrition arises sorrow in the inferior
part of the soul which is called the seat of concupiscence.

With propriety, therefore, is contrition defined a sorrow, because it produces sorrow; hence penitents, in order
to express it, used to change their garments. Our Lord alludes to this custom when He says: Woe to thee,
Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been
wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sack-cloth and ashes.




                                                         172
Names Of Sorrow For Sin

To signify the intensity of this sorrow the name contrition has rightly been given to the detestation of sin of
which we speak. The word means the breaking of an object into small parts by means of a stone or some harder
substance; and here it is used metaphorically, to signify that our hearts, hardened by pride, are beaten and
broken by penance. Hence no-other sorrow, not even that which is felt for the death of parents, or children, or
for any other calamity, is called contrition. The word is exclusively employed to express the sorrow with which
we are overwhelmed by the forfeiture of the grace of God and of our own innocence.

Contrition, however, is often designated by other names. Sometimes it is called contrition of heart, because the
word heart is frequently used in Scripture to express the will. As the movement of the body originates in the
heart, so the will is the faculty which governs and controls the other powers of the soul.

By the holy Fathers it is also called compunction of heart, and hence they preferred to entitle their works on
contrition treatises On Compunction of Heart; for as ulcers are lanced with a knife in order to allow the escape
of the poisonous matter accumulated within, so the heart, as it were, is pierced with the lance of contrition, to
enable it to emit the deadly poison of sin.

Hence, contrition is called by the Prophet Joel, a rending of the heart. Be converted to me, he says, with all your
hearts in fasting, in weeping, in mourning, and rend your hearts.




Qualities of Sorrow for Sin




It Should Be Supreme

That sorrow for sins committed should be so profound and supreme that no greater sorrow could be thought of
will easily appear from the considerations that follow.

Perfect contrition is an act of charity, emanating from what is called filial fear; hence it is clear that the measure
of contrition and of charity should be the same. Since, therefore, the charity which we cherish towards God, is
the most perfect love, it follows that contrition should be the keenest sorrow of the soul. God is to be loved
above all things, and whatever separates us from God is therefore to be hated above all things. It is also worthy
of note that to charity and contrition the language of Scripture assigns the same extent. Of charity it is said:
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart.' Of contrition the Lord says through the Prophet: Be
converted with your whole heart.

Secondly, it is true that of all objects which deserve our love, God is the supreme good, and it is not less true
that of all objects which deserve our execration sin is the supreme evil. The same reason, then, which prompts
us to confess that God is to be loved above all things, obliges us also of necessity to acknowledge that sin is to
be hated above all things. That God is to be loved above all things, so that we should be prepared to sacrifice
our lives rather than offend Him, these words of the Lord clearly declare: He that loveth father or mother more
than me, is not worthy of me; He that will save his life shall lose it.

Further, it should be noted that since, as St. Bernard says, there is no limit or measure to charity, or to use his
own words, as the measure of loving God is to love Him without measure, there should be no limit to the hatred
of sin.




                                                         173
Sorrow For Sin Should Be Intense

Besides, our contrition should be not only the greatest, but also the most intense, and so perfect that it excludes
all apathy and indifference; for it is written in Deuteronomy: When thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt
find him: yet so if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy soul, and in Jeremias.: Thou shalt
seek me and shalt find me, when thou shalt seek me unto all thy heart; and I will be found by thee, saith the
Lord.

If, however, our contrition be not perfect, it may nevertheless be true and efficacious. For as things which fall
under the senses frequently touch the heart more sensibly than things purely spiritual, it sometimes happens that
persons feel more intense sorrow for the death of their children than for the grievousness of their sins.

Our contrition may also be true and efficacious, although unaccompanied by tears. Penitential tears, however,
are much to be desired and commended. On this subject St. Augustine has well said: The spirit of Christian
charity lives not within you, if you lament the body from which the soul has departed, but lament not the soul
from which God has departed. To the same effect are the words of the Redeemer above cited: Woe to thee,
Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been
wrought in you, they had long since done penance, in sack-cloth and ashes. To establish this truth it will suffice
to recall the well-known examples of the Ninivites, of David, of the woman who was a sinner, and of the Prince
of the Apostles, all. of whom obtained the pardon of their sins when they implored the mercy of God with
abundant tears.




Sorrow For Sin Should Be Universal

The faithful should be earnestly exhorted and admonished to strive to extend their contrition to each mortal sin.
For it is thus that Ezechias describes contrition: I will recount to thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
To recount all our years is to examine our sins one by one in order to have sorrow for them from our hearts. In
Ezechiel also we read: If the wicked do penance for all his sins, he shall live. In this sense St. Augustine says:
Let the sinner consider the quality of his sins, as to time, place, variety and person.

In this matter, however, the faithful should not despair of the infinite goodness and mercy of God. For since
God is most desirous of our salvation, He will not delay to pardon us. With a father's fondness, He embraces the
sinner the moment he enters into himself, turns to the Lord, and, having detested all his sins, resolves that later
on, as far as he is able, he will call them singly to mind and detest them. The Almighty Himself, by the mouth
of His Prophet, commands us to hope, when He says: The wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what
day soever he shall turn from his wickedness.




Conditions Required for Contrition

From what has been said we may gather the chief requisites of true contrition. In these the faithful are to be
accurately instructed, that each may know the means of attaining, and may have a fixed standard by which to
determine, how far he may be removed from the perfection of this virtue.




Detestation Of Sin




                                                        174
We must, then, in the first place, detest and deplore all out sins. If our sorrow and detestation extend only to
some sins, our repentance is not salutary, but feigned and false. Whosoever shall keep the whole law, says St.
James, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.




Intention Of Confession And Satisfaction

In the next place, our contrition must be accompanied with a desire of confessing and satisfying for our sins.
Concerning these dispositions we shall treat in their proper place.




Purpose Of Amendment

Thirdly, the penitent must form a fixed and firm purpose of amendment of life. This the Prophet clearly teaches
in the following words: If the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my
commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living Ice shall live, and shall not die: I will not remember all his
iniquities which he hath done. And a little after: When the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness
which he hath wrought, and doth judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive. Still further on he adds: Be
converted and do penance for all your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all
your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. To the
woman taken in adultery Christ our Lord commanded the same thing: Go thy way, and sin no more; and also to
the lame man whom He cured at the pool of Bethsaida: Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more.




Reasons For These Conditions

That a sorrow for sin and a firm purpose of avoiding sin for the future are two conditions indispensable to
contrition nature and reason clearly show. He who would be reconciled to a friend whom he has wronged must
regret to have injured and offended him, and his future conduct must be such as to avoid offending in anything
against friendship.

Furthermore, these are conditions to which man is bound to yield obedience; for the law to which man is
subject, be it natural, divine, or human, he is bound to obey. If, therefore, by force or fraud, the penitent has
taken anything from his neighbour, he is bound to restitution. Likewise if, by word or deed he has injured his
neighbour’s honour or reputation, he is under an obligation of repairing the injury by procuring him some
advantage or rendering him some service. Well known to all is the maxim of St. Augustine: The sin is not
forgiven unless what has been taken away is restored.




Forgiveness Of Injuries

Again, not less necessary for contrition than the other chief conditions is a care that it be accompanied by entire
forgiveness of the injuries which we may have received from others. This our Lord and Saviour admonishes
when He declares: If you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your
offences, but if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.

These are the conditions which the faithful should observe as regards contrition. There are other dispositions
which, although not essential to true and salutary penance, contribute to render contrition more perfect and
complete in its kind, and which pastors will readily discover.


                                                        175
The Effects of Contrition

Simply to make known those things which pertain to salvation should not be deemed a full discharge of the duty
of pastors; their zeal and industry should be exerted to persuade the people to adopt these truths as their rule of
conduct and as the governing principle of their actions. Hence it will be highly useful often to explain the power
and utility of contrition.

For whereas most other pious practices, such as alms, fasting, prayer and similar holy and commendable works,
are sometimes rejected by God on account of the faults of those who perform them, contrition can never be
other than pleasing and acceptable to Him. A contrite and humble heart, O God, exclaims the Prophet, thou wilt
not despise.

Nay more, the same Prophet declares elsewhere that, as soon as we have conceived this contrition in our hearts,
our sins are forgiven by God: I said, I will confess my injustice to the Lord, and thou hast forgiven the
wickedness of my sin. Of this truth we have a figure in the ten lepers, who, when sent by our Lord to the priests,
were cured of their leprosy before they had reached them; which gives us to understand that such is the efficacy
of true contrition, of which we have spoken above, that through it we obtain from the Lord the immediate
pardon of all sins.




Means of Arousing True Contrition

To move the faithful to contrition, it will be very useful if pastors point out some method by which each one
may excite himself to contrition.

They should all be admonished frequently to examine their consciences, in order to ascertain if they have been
faithful in the observance of those things which God and His Church require. Should anyone be conscious of
sin, he should immediately accuse himself, humbly solicit pardon from God, and implore time to confess and
satisfy for his sins. Above all, let him supplicate the aid of divine grace, in order that he may not relapse into
those sins which he now penitently deplores.

Pastors should also take care that the faithful be excited to a supreme hatred of sin, both because its turpitude
and baseness are very great and because it brings us the gravest losses and misfortunes. For sin deprives us of
the friendship of God, to whom we are indebted for so many invaluable blessings, and from whom we might
have expected and received gifts of still higher value; and along with this it consigns us to eternal death and to
torments unending and most severe.




The Second Part of Penance




Confession

Having said so much on contrition, we now come to confession, which is another part of Penance. The care and
exactness which its exposition demands of pastors must be at once obvious, if we only reflect that most holy
persons are firmly persuaded that whatever of piety, of holiness, of religion, has been preserved to our times in
the Church, through God's goodness, must be ascribed in great measure to confession. It cannot, therefore, be a
matter of surprise that the enemy of the human race, in his efforts to destroy utterly the Catholic Church, should,


                                                       176
through the agency of the ministers of his wicked designs, have assailed with all his might this bulwark, as it
were, of Christian virtue. It should be shown, therefore, in the first place that the institution of confession is
most useful and even necessary to us.




Necessity Of Confession

Contrition, it is true, blots out sin; but who does not know that to effect this it must be so intense, so ardent, so
vehement, as to bear a proportion to the magnitude of the crimes which it effaces? This is a degree of contrition
which few reach; and hence, in this way, very few indeed could hope to obtain the pardon of their sins. It,
therefore, became necessary that the most merciful Lord should provide by some easier means for the common
salvation of men; and this He has done in His admirable wisdom, by giving to His Church the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.

According to the doctrine of the Catholic Church, a doctrine firmly to be believed and constantly professed by
all, if the sinner have a sincere sorrow for his sins and a firm resolution of avoiding them in future, although he
bring not with him that contrition which may be sufficient of itself to obtain pardon, all his sins are forgiven and
remitted through the power of the keys, when he confesses them properly to the priest. Justly, then, do those
most holy men, our Fathers, proclaim that by the keys of the Church the gate of heaven is thrown open, a truth
which no one can doubt since the Council of Florence has decreed that the effect of Penance is absolution from
sin.




Advantages Of Confession

To appreciate further the great advantages of confession we may turn to a fact taught by experience. To those
who have led immoral lives nothing is found so useful towards a reformation of morals as sometimes to disclose
their secret thoughts, all their words and actions, to a prudent and faithful friend, who can assist them by his
advice and cooperation. For the same reason it must prove most salutary to those whose minds are agitated by
the consciousness of guilt to make known the diseases and wounds of their souls to the priest, as the vicegerent
of Christ our Lord, bound to eternal secrecy by the strictest of laws. (In the Sacrament of Penance) they will
find immediate remedies, the healing qualities of which will not only remove the present malady, but will also
have such a heavenly efficacy in preparing the soul against an easy relapse into the same kind of disease and
infirmity.

Another advantage of confession, which should not be overlooked, is that it contributes powerfully to the
preservation of social order. Abolish sacramental confession, and that moment you deluge society with all sorts
of secret and heinous crimes -- crimes too, and others of still greater enormity, which men, once that they have
been depraved by vicious habits, will not dread to commit in open day. The salutary shame that attends
confession restrains licentiousness, bridles desire and checks wickedness.




Definition Of Confession

Having explained the advantages of confession, pastors should next unfold its nature and efficacy. Confession,
then, is defined: A sacramental accusation of one's sins, made to obtain pardon by virtue of the keys.

It is rightly called an accusation, because sins are not to be told as if the sinner boasted of his crimes, as they do
who are glad when they have done evil; nor are they to be related as stories told for the sake of amusing idle




                                                         177
listeners. They are to be confessed as matters of self-accusation, with a desire, as it were, to avenge them on
ourselves.

We confess our sins with a view to obtain pardon. In this respect the tribunal of penance differs from other
tribunals, which take cognisance of capital offences, and before which a confession of guilt does not secure
acquittal and pardon, but penalty and punishment.

The definition of confession by the holy Fathers, although different in words, is substantially the same.
Confession, says St. Augustine, is the disclosure of a secret disease, with the hope of obtaining pardon; and St.
Gregory: Confession is a detestation of sins. Both of these definitions accord with, and are contained in the
preceding definition.




Confession Instituted By Christ

In the next place, it is a duty of greatest moment that pastors should unhesitatingly teach that this Sacrament
owes its institution to the singular goodness and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has ordered all things
well, and solely with a view to our salvation.

After His Resurrection He breathed on the Apostles, assembled together, saying: Receive ye the Holy Ghost,
whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. Now in
giving to priests the power to retain and forgive sins, it is evident that our Lord made them also judges in this
matter.

Our Lord seems to have signified the same thing when, having raised Lazarus from the dead, He commanded
His Apostles to loose him from the bands in which he was bound. This is the interpretation of St. Augustine.
The priests, he says, can now do more: they can exercise greater clemency towards those who confess and
whose sins they forgive. The Lord, in giving over Lazarus, whom He had already raised from the dead, to be
loosed by the hands of His disciples, wished us to understand that to priests was given the power of loosing.

To this also refers the command given by our Lord to the lepers cured on the way, that they show themselves to
the priests, and subject themselves to their judgment.

Invested, then, as they are, by our Lord with power to remit and retain sins, priests are evidently appointed
judges of the matter on which they are to pronounce; and since, according to the wise remark of the Council of
Trent, we cannot form an accurate judgment on any matter, or award to crime a just proportion of punishment
without having previously examined and made ourselves well acquainted with the case, it follows that the
penitent is obliged to make known to the priests, through the medium of confession, each and every sin.

This doctrine the pastors should teach as defined by the holy Council of Trent, and handed down by the uniform
doctrine of the Catholic Church. An attentive perusal of the Fathers will present passages throughout their
works, proving in the clearest terms that this Sacrament was instituted by our Lord, and that the law of
sacramental confession, which, from the Greek, they call exomologesis, and exagoreusis, is to be received as
true Gospel teaching.

If we seek figures in the Old Testament, the different kinds of sacrifices which were offered by the priests for
the expiation of different sorts of sins, seem, beyond all doubt, to have reference to confession of sins.




Rites Added By The Church




                                                        178
Not only are the faithful to be taught that confession was instituted by our Lord. They are also to be reminded
that, by authority of the Church, certain rites and solemn ceremonies have been added which, although not
essential to the Sacrament, serve to place its dignity more fully before the eyes of the penitent, and to prepare
his soul, so that, kindled with devotion, he may more easily receive the grace of God. When, with uncovered
head and bended knees, with eyes fixed on the earth and hands raised in supplication, and with other indications
of Christian humility not essential to the Sacrament, we confess our sins, our minds are thus deeply impressed
with a clear conviction of the heavenly virtue of the Sacrament, and also of the necessity of most earnestly
beseeching and imploring the mercy of God.




The Law of Confession

Nor let it be supposed that, although confession was instituted by our Lord, He did not declare its use to be
necessary. The faithful must be impressed with the conviction that he who is dead in sin is to be recalled to
spiritual life by means of sacramental confession.




Proof Of The Obligation

This truth is clearly conveyed by our Lord Himself, when, by a most beautiful metaphor, He calls the power of
administering this Sacrament, the key of the kingdom of heaven. Just as no one can enter any place without the
help of him who has the keys, so no one is admitted to heaven unless its gates be unlocked by the priests to
whose custody the Lord gave the keys. This power would otherwise be of no use in the Church. If heaven can
be entered without the power of the keys, in vain would they to whom the keys were given seek to prevent
entrance within its portals.

This thought was familiar to the mind of St. Augustine. Let no man, he says, say within himself: "I repent in
secret to the Lord. God, who has power to pardon me, knows the inmost sentiments of my heart.,, Was there,
then, no reason for saying "whatsoever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven," no reason why the keys
were given to the Church of God? The same doctrine is taught by St. Ambrose in his treatise On Penance, when
refuting the heresy of the Novatians who asserted that the power of forgiving sins belonged solely to God.'
Who, says he, yields greater reverence to God, he who obeys or he who resists His commands? God commands
us to obey His ministers; and by obeying them, we honour God alone.




The Age At Which The Law Of Confession Obliges

As the law of confession was no doubt enacted and established by our Lord Himself, it is our duty to ascertain,
on whom, at what age, and at what period of the year, it becomes obligatory. According to the canon of the
Council of Lateran, which begins: Omnis utriusque sexus, no person is bound by the law of Confession until he
has arrived at the use of reason, -- a time determinable by no fixed number of years. It may, however, be laid
down as a general principle, that children are bound to go to confession as soon as they are able to discern good
from evil, and are capable of malice; for, when a person has arrived at an age when he must begin to attend to
the work of his salvation, he is bound to confess his sins to a priest, since there is no other salvation for one
whose conscience is burdened with sin.




At What Time The Law Of Confession Obliges




                                                       179
In the same canon holy Church has defined the period within which we are especially bound to discharge the
duty of confession. It commands all the faithful to confess their sins at least once a year. If, however, we consult
our eternal interests, we will certainly not neglect to have recourse to confession as often, at least, as we are in
danger of death, or undertake to perform any act incompatible with the state of sin, such as to administer or
receive the Sacraments. The same rule should be strictly followed when we are apprehensive of forgetting some
sin, into which we may have fallen; for we cannot confess sins unless we remember them, neither do we obtain
pardon unless our sins are blotted out through sacramental confession.




The Qualities of Confession

But since in confession many things are to be observed, some of which are essential, some not essential to the
Sacrament, all these matters should be carefully treated. Access can easily be had to works and treatises from
which an explanation of all these things can be drawn.




Confession Should Be Entire

Pastors should teach, first of all, that care must be exercised that confession be complete and entire. All mortal
sins must be revealed to the priest. Venial sins, which do not separate us from the grace of God, and into which
we frequently fall, although they may be usefully confessed, as the experience of the pious proves, may be
omitted without sin, and expiated by a variety of other means. Mortal sins, as we have already said, are all to be
confessed, even though they be most secret, or be opposed only to the last two Commandments of the
Decalogue. Such secret sins often inflict deeper wounds on the soul than those which are committed openly and
publicly.

So the Council of Trent has defined, and such has been the constant teaching of the Church, as the Fathers
declare. St. Ambrose speaks thus: Without the confession of his sin, no man can be justified from his sin. In
confirmation of the same doctrine, St. Jerome, on Ecclesiastes, says: If the serpent, the devil, has secretly and
without the knowledge of a third person, bitten anyone, and has infused into him the poison of sin; if unwilling
to disclose his wound to his brother or master, he is silent and will not do penance, his master, who has a tongue
ready to cure him, can render him no service. The same doctrine we find in St. Cyprian, in his sermon On the
Fallen. Although guiltless, he says, of the heinous crime of sacrificing to idols, or of having purchased
certificates to that effect; yet, as they entertained the thought of doing so, they should confess it with grief to the
priests of God. In fine, such is the unanimous voice and teaching of all the Doctors of the Church.

In confession we should employ all that care and exactness which we usually bestow upon worldly concerns of
great moment, and all our efforts should be directed to the cure of our soul's wounds and to the destruction of
the roots of sin. We should not be satisfied with the bare enumeration of our mortal sins, but should mention
such circumstances as considerably aggravate or extenuate their malice. Some circumstances are so serious as
of themselves to constitute mortal guilt. On no account whatever, therefore, are such circumstances to be
omitted. Thus if one man has killed another, he must state whether his victim was a layman or an ecclesiastic.
Or, if he has had sinful relations with a woman, he must state whether the female was unmarried or married, a
relative or a person consecrated to God by vow. These circumstances change the nature of the sins; so that the
first kind of unlawful intercourse is called by theologians simple fornication, the second adultery, the third
incest, and the fourth sacrilege. Again, theft is numbered in the catalogue of sins. But if a person has stolen one
golden coin, his sin is less grievous than if he had stolen a hundred or two hundred, or an immense sum; and if
the stolen money belonged to the Church, the sin would be still more grievous. The same rule applies to the
circumstances of time and place, but' the examples are too well known from many books to require mention
here. Circumstances such as these are, therefore, to be mentioned; but those which do not considerably
aggravate the malice of the sin may be lawfully omitted.




                                                         180
Sins Concealed

So important is it that confession be entire that if the penitent confesses only some of his sins and wilfully
neglects to accuse himself of others which should be confessed, he not only does not profit by his confession,
but involves himself in new guilt. Such an enumeration of sins cannot be called sacramental confession; on the
contrary, the penitent must repeat his confession, not omitting to accuse himself of having, under the semblance
of confession, profaned the sanctity of the Sacrament.




Sins Forgotten

But should the confession seem defective, either because the penitent forgot some grievous sins, or because,
although intent on confessing all his sins, he did not examine the recesses of his conscience with sufficient
accuracy, he is not bound to repeat his confession. It will be sufficient, when he recollects the sins which he had
forgotten, to confess them to a priest on a future occasion.

It should be noted, however, that we are not to examine our consciences with careless indifference, or to be so
negligent in recalling our sins as to seem as if unwilling to remember them. Should this have been the case, the
confession must by all means be made over again.




Confession Should Be Plain, Simple, Sincere

In the second place our confession should be plain, simple and undisguised; not artfully made, as is the case
with some who seem more intent on defending themselves than on confessing their sins. Our confession should
be such as to disclose to the priest a true image of our lives, such as we ourselves know them to be, exhibiting
as doubtful that which is doubtful, and as certain that which is certain. If, then, we neglect to enumerate our
sins, or introduce extraneous matter, our confession, it is clear, lacks this quality.




Confession Should Be Prudent, Modest, Brief

Prudence and modesty in explaining matters of confession are also much to be commended, and a superfluity of
words is to be carefully avoided. Whatever is necessary to make known the nature of every sin is to be
explained briefly and modestly.




Confession Should Be Made Privately And Often

Secrecy as regards confession should be strictly observed, as well by the penitent as by the priest. Hence, no one
can, on any account, confess by messenger or letter, because in those cases secrecy would not be possible.

The faithful should be careful above all to cleanse their consciences from sin by frequent confession. When a
person is in mortal sin nothing can be more salutary, so precarious is human life, than to have immediate
recourse to confession. But even if we could promise ourselves a long life, yet it would be truly disgraceful that




                                                       181
we who are so particular in whatever relates to cleanliness of dress or person, were not at least equally careful in
preserving the lustre of the soul unsullied from the foul stains of sin.




The Minister of the Sacrament of Penance




The Usual Minister

We now come to treat of the minister of this Sacrament. That the minister of the Sacrament of Penance must be
a priest possessing ordinary or delegated jurisdiction the laws of the Church sufficiently declare. Whoever
discharges this sacred function must be invested not only with the power of orders, but also with that of
jurisdiction. Of this ministry we have an illustrious proof in these words of our Lord, recorded by St. John:
Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained, words
addressed not to all, but to the Apostles only, to whom, in this function of the ministry, priests succeed.

This is also most fitting, for as all the grace imparted by this Sacrament is communicated from Christ the Head
to His members, they who alone have power to consecrate His true body should alone have power to administer
this Sacrament to His mystical body, the faithful, particularly as these are qualified and disposed by means of
the Sacrament of Penance to receive the Holy Eucharist.

The scrupulous care which in the primitive ages of the Church guarded the right of the ordinary priest is easily
seen from the ancient decrees of the Fathers, which provided that no Bishop or priest, except in case of great
necessity, presume to exercise any function in the parish of another without the authority of him who governed
there. This law derives its sanction from the Apostle when he commanded Titus to ordain priests in every city,
to administer to the faithful the heavenly food of doctrine and of the Sacraments.




The Minister In Danger Of Death

In order that none may perish, if there is imminent danger of death, and recourse cannot be had to the proper
priest, the Council of Trent teaches that according to the ancient practice of the Church of God it is then lawful
for any priest, not only to remit all kinds of Sill, whatever faculties they might otherwise require, but also to
absolve from excommunication.




Qualifications Of The Minister

Besides the powers of orders and of jurisdiction, which are of absolute necessity, the minister of this Sacrament,
holding as he does the place at once of judge and physician, should be gifted not only with knowledge and
erudition, but also with prudence.

As judge, his knowledge, it is evident, should be more than ordinary, for by it he is to examine into the nature of
sins, and among the various kinds of sins to judge which are grievous and which are not, keeping in view the
rank and condition of the person.

As physician he has also occasion for consummate prudence, for to him it belongs to administer to the diseased
soul those healing medicines which will not only effect the cure, but prove suitable preservatives against its
future contagion.


                                                       182
The faithful, therefore, will see the great care that each one should take in selecting (as confessor) a priest, who
is recommended by integrity of life, by learning and prudence, who is deeply impressed with the awful weight
and responsibility of the station which he holds, who understands well the punishment due to every sin, and can
also discern who are to be loosed and who to be bound.




The Confessor Must Observe The Seal Of Confession

Since each one is most anxious that his sins and defilements should be buried in oblivion, the faithful are to be
admonished that there is no reason whatever to apprehend that what is made known in confession will ever be
revealed by the priest to anyone, or that by it the penitent can at any time be brought into danger of any sort.
The laws of the Church threaten the severest penalties against any priests who would fail to observe a perpetual
and religious silence concerning all the sins confessed to them. Let the priest, says the great Council of Lateran,
take special care, neither by word or sign, nor by any other means whatever, to betray in the least degree the
sinner.




Duties of the Confessor towards Various Classes of Penitents

Having treated of the minister of this Sacrament, the order of our matter requires that we next proceed to
explain some general heads which are of considerable importance with regard to the use and practice of
confession.

Many of the faithful, to whom, as a rule, no time seems to pass so slowly as that which is appointed by the laws
of the Church for the duty of confession, are so removed from Christian perfection that, far from bestowing
attention on those other matters which are obviously most efficacious in conciliating the favour and friendship
of God, they do not even try to remember the sins that are to be confessed to the priest.

Since, therefore, nothing is to be omitted which can assist the faithful in the important work of salvation, the
priest should be careful to observe if the penitent be truly contrite for his sins, and deliberately and firmly
resolved to avoid sin for the future.




The Well Disposed Should Be Exhorted To Thanksgiving And Perseverance

If the sinner is found to be thus disposed, he is to be admonished and earnestly exhorted to pour out his heart in
gratitude to God for so great and so singular a blessing, and to supplicate unceasingly the aid of divine grace,
shielded by which he may securely combat his evil propensities.

He should also be taught not to suffer a day to pass without devoting a portion of it to meditation on some
mystery of the Passion of our Lord, and to exciting and inflaming himself to the imitation and most ardent love
of his Redeemer. The fruit of such meditation will be to fortify him more and more every day against all the
assaults of the devil. For what other reason is there why our courage sinks and our strength fails the moment the
enemy makes even the slightest attack on us, but that we neglect by pious meditation to kindle within us the fire
of divine love, which animates and invigorates the soul?




The Indisposed Should Be Helped




                                                        183
But should the priest perceive that the penitent is not truly contrite, he will endeavour to inspire him with an
anxious desire for contrition, inflamed by which he may resolve to ask and implore this heavenly gift from the
mercy of God.




Those Who Seek To Excuse Their Sins Should Be Corrected

The pride of some who seek by vain excuses to justify or extenuate their offences is carefully to be repressed. If,
for instance, a penitent confesses that he was wrought up to anger, and immediately transfers the blame of the
excitement to another, who, he complains, was the aggressor, he is to be reminded that such apologies are
indications of a proud spirit, and of a man who either thinks lightly of, or is unacquainted with the enormity of
his sin, while they serve rather to aggravate than to extenuate his guilt. He who thus labours to justify his
conduct seems to say that then only will he exercise patience, when no one injures him -- a disposition than
which nothing can be more unworthy of a Christian. Instead of lamenting the state of him who inflicted the
injury he disregards the grievousness of the sin, and is angry with his brother. Having had an opportunity of
honouring God by his exemplary patience, and of correcting a brother by his meekness, he turns the very means
of salvation to his own destruction.




Those Who Are Ashamed To Confess Their Sins Should Be Instructed

Still more pernicious is the fault of those who, yielding to a foolish bashfulness, cannot induce themselves to
confess their sins. Such persons are to be encouraged by exhortation, and are to be reminded that there is no
reason whatever why they should fear to disclose their sins, that to no one can it appear surprising if persons fall
into sin, the common malady of the human race and the natural consequence of human infirmity.




The Careless Should Be Rebuked

There are others who, either because they seldom confess their sins, or because they have bestowed no care or
attention on the examination of their consciences, do not know well how to begin or end their confession. Such
persons deserve to be severely rebuked, and are to be taught that before anyone approaches the tribunal of
Penance he should employ every diligence to excite himself to contrition for his sins, and that this he cannot do
without endeavouring to know and recollect them severally.




The Unprepared Should Be Dismissed Or Led To Good Disposition

Should the confessor meet persons of this class entirely unprepared, he should dismiss them without harshness,
exhorting them in the kindest terms to take some time to reflect on their sins, and then return; but should they
declare that they have already done everything in their power to prepare, and there is reason to apprehend that if
sent away they may not return, their confession is to be heard, particularly if they manifest some disposition to
amend their lives and can be induced to accuse their own negligence and promise to atone for it at another time
by a diligent and accurate scrutiny of conscience. In such cases, however, the confessor should proceed with
caution. If, after having heard the confession, he is of the opinion that the penitent did not entirely lack diligence
in examining his conscience or sorrow in detesting his sins, he may absolve him; but if he has found him
deficient in both, he should, as we have already said, admonish him to use greater care in his examination of
conscience, and dismiss him as kindly as he can.




                                                        184
The Pastor Should Show The Wrong Of Human Respect

But as it sometimes happens that females, who may have forgotten some sin in a former confession, cannot
bring themselves to return to the confessor, dreading to expose themselves before the people to the suspicion of
having been guilty of something grievous or of looking for the praise of extraordinary piety, the pastor should
frequently remind the faithful, both publicly and privately, that no one is gifted with so tenacious a memory as
to be able to recollect all his thoughts, words and actions; that the faithful, therefore, should they call to mind
some sin which they had previously forgotten, should not be deterred from returning to the priest. These and
many other matters of the same nature demand the attention of priests in confession.




The Third Part of Penance




Satisfaction

Let us now come to the third part of Penance, which is called satisfaction. We shall begin by explaining its
nature and efficacy, because the enemies of the Catholic Church have on these subjects taken ample occasion to
sow discord and division, to the serious detriment of Christians.




General Meaning Of The Word "Satisfaction,"

Satisfaction is the full payment of a debt; for that is sufficient or satisfactory to which nothing is wanting.
Hence, when we speak of reconciliation to favour, to satisfy means to do what is sufficient to atone to the
angered mind for an injury offered; and in this sense satisfaction is nothing more than compensation for an
injury done to another. But, to come to the object that now engages us, theologians make use of the word
satisfaction to signify the compensation man makes, by offering to God some reparation for the sins he has
committed.




Various Kinds Of Satisfaction To God

This sort of satisfaction, since it has several degrees, can be understood in various senses.

The first and highest degree of satisfaction is that by which whatever we owe to God on account of our sins is
paid abundantly, even though He should deal with us according to the strictest rigour of His justice. This degree
of satisfaction appeases God and renders Him propitious to us; and it is a satisfaction for which we are indebted
to Christ our Lord alone, who paid the price of our sins on the cross, and offered to God a superabundant
satisfaction. No created being could have been of such worth as to deliver us from so heavy a debt. He is the
propitiation for our sins, says St. John, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world. This
satisfaction, therefore, is full and superabundant, perfectly adequate to the debt of all sins committed in this
world. It gives to man's actions great worth before God, and without it they would be deserving of no esteem
whatever. This David seems to have had in view when, having asked himself, what shall I render to the -Lord,
for all the things that he hath rendered to me? and finding nothing besides this satisfaction, which he expressed
by the word chalice, a worthy return for so many and such great favours, he replied: I will take the chalice of
salvation, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.


                                                        185
There is another kind of satisfaction, which is called canonical, and is performed within a certain fixed period of
time. Hence, according to the most ancient practice of the Church, when penitents are absolved from their sins,
some penance is imposed, the performance of which is commonly called satisfaction.

By the same name is called any sort of punishment endured for sin, although not imposed by the priest, but
spontaneously undertaken and performed by ourselves.




Elements Of Sacramental Satisfaction

This, however, does not belong to Penance as a Sacrament. Only that satisfaction constitutes part of the
Sacrament which, as we have already said, is offered to God for sins at the command of the priest. Furthermore,
it must be accompanied by a deliberate and firm purpose carefully to avoid sin for the future.

For to satisfy, as some define it, is to pay due honour to God: and this, it is evident, no person can do, who is not
entirely resolved to avoid sin. Again, to satisfy is to cut off all occasions of sin, and to close every avenue
against its suggestions. In accordance with this idea of satisfaction some have defined it as a cleansing, which
effaces whatever defilement may remain in the soul from the stains of sin, and which exempts us from the
temporal chastisements due to sin.




Necessity Of Satisfaction

Such being the nature of satisfaction, it will not be difficult to convince the faithful of the necessity imposed on
the penitent of performing works of satisfaction. They are to be taught that sin carries in its train two evils, the
stain and the punishment. Whenever the stain is effaced, the punishment of eternal death is forgiven with the
guilt to which it was due; yet, as the Council of Trent declares, the remains of sin and the temporal punishment
are not always remitted.

Of this the Scriptures afford many conspicuous examples, such as are found in the third chapter of Genesis, in
the twelfth and twenty-second of Numbers, and in many other places. That of David, however, is the best
known and most striking. Although the Prophet Nathan had announced to him: The Lord also hath taken a-way
thy sin, thou shalt not , yet David voluntarily subjected himself to the most severe penance, imploring night and
day the mercy of God in these words: Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; for I
know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me. Thus did he beseech the Lord to pardon not only the crime,
but also the punishment due to it, and to restore him, cleansed from the remains of sin, to his former state of
purity and integrity. This he besought with most earnest supplications, and yet the Lord punished his
transgression with the loss of his adulterous offspring, the rebellion and death of his beloved son Absalom, and
with the other chastisements and calamities with which he had previously threatened him.

In Exodus, too, we read that though the Lord yielded to the prayers of Moses and spared the idolatrous
Israelites, yet He threatened the enormity of their crime with heavy chastisement, and Moses himself declared
that the Lord would take severest vengeance on it, even to the third and fourth generations.

That such was at all times the doctrine of the holy Fathers in the Catholic Church, their own testimony most
clearly proves.




Advantages of Satisfaction




                                                        186
It Is Required By God’s Justice And Mercy

Why in the Sacrament of Penance, as in that of Baptism, the punishment due to sin is not entirely remitted is
admirably explained in these words of the Council of Trent: Divine justice seems to require that they who
through ignorance sinned before Baptism, should recover the friendship of God in a different manner from
those who, after they have been freed from the thraldom, of sin and the devil and have received the gifts of the
Holy Ghost, dread not knowingly to violate the temple of God and grieve the Holy Spirit. It is also in keeping
with the divine mercy not to remit our sins without any satisfaction, lest, taking occasion hence, and imagining
our sins less grievous than they are, we should become injurious, as it were, and contumelious to the Holy
Ghost, and should fall into greater enormities, treasuring up to ourselves wrath against the day of wrath. These
satisfactory penances have, no doubt, great influence in recalling from and, as it were, bridling against sin, and
in rendering the sinner more vigilant and cautious for the future.




Satisfaction Atones To The Church

Furthermore (these satisfactions) serve as testimonies of our sorrow for sin committed, and thus atone to the
Church which is grievously insulted by our crimes. God, says St. Augustine, despises not a contrite and humble
heart; but, as heartfelt grief is generally concealed from others, and is not manifested by words or other signs,
wisely, therefore, are penitential times appointed by those who preside over the Church, in order to atone to the
Church, in which sins are forgiven.




Satisfaction Deters Others From Sin

Besides, the example presented by our penitential practices serves as a lesson to others, how to regulate their
lives and practice piety. Seeing the punishments inflicted on sin, they must feel the necessity of using the
greatest circumspection through life, and of correcting their former habits.

The Church, therefore, with great wisdom ordained that when anyone had committed a public crime, a public
penance should be imposed on him, in order that others, being deterred by fear, might more carefully avoid sin
in future. This has sometimes been observed even with regard to secret sins of more than usual gravity.

But with regard to public sinners, as we have already said, they were never absolved until they had performed
public penance. During the performance of this penance, the pastors poured out prayers to God for their
salvation, and ceased not to exhort the penitents to do the same. In this respect, great was the care and solicitude
of St. Ambrose, of whom it is related that many who came to the tribunal of Penance with hardened hearts were
so softened by his tears as to conceive the sorrow of true contrition. But in process of time the severity of
ancient discipline was so relaxed and charity grew so cold, that in our days many of the faithful think inward
sorrow of soul and grief of heart unnecessary for obtaining pardon, imagining that a mere appearance of sorrow
is sufficient.




By Satisfaction We Are Made Like Unto Christ

Again, by undergoing these penances we are made like unto Jesus Christ our Head, inasmuch as He Himself
suffered and was tempted. As St. Bernard observes, nothing can appear so unseemly as a delicate member under
a head crowned with thorns. To use the words of the Apostle: We are joint-heirs with Christ, yet so if we suffer



                                                        187
with him; and again, If we be dead with him, we shall live also with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with
him.




Satisfaction Heals The Wounds Of Sin

St. Bernard also observes that sin produces two effects: a stain on the soul and a wound; that the stain is
removed through the mercy of God, while to heal the wound inflicted by sin the remedy of penance is most
necessary. When a wound has been healed, some scars remain which demand attention; likewise, with regard to
the soul, after the guilt of sin is forgiven, some of its effects remain, from which the soul requires to be
cleansed.

St. Chrysostom fully confirms the same doctrine when he says: It is not enough that the arrow has been
extracted from the body; the wound which it inflicted must also be healed. So with regard to the soul, it is not
enough that sin has been pardoned; the wound which it has left must also be healed by penance.

St. Augustine also frequently teaches that penance exhibits at once the mercy and the justice of God, -- His
mercy by which He pardons sin and the eternal punishment due to sin; His justice by which He exacts
temporary punishment from the sinner.




Satisfaction Disarms The Divine Vengeance

Finally, the punishment which the sinner endures disarms the vengeance of God and averts the punishments
decreed against us. Thus the Apostle says: If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but whilst we
are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. If all this is explained to
the faithful, it must have great influence in exciting them to perform works of penance.




Source of the Efficacy of Satisfactory Works

Of the great efficacy of penance we may form some idea, if we reflect that it arises entirely from the merits of
the Passion of Christ our Lord. It is His Passion that imparts to our good actions two greatest advantages: the
first, that we may merit the rewards of eternal glory, so that a cup of cold water given in His name shall not be
without its reward; the second, that we may be able to satisfy for our sins.

Nor does this lessen the most perfect and superabundant satisfaction of Christ our Lord, but, on the contrary,
renders it still more conspicuous and illustrious. For the grace of Christ is seen to abound more, inasmuch as it
communicates to us not only what He merited and paid of Himself alone, but also what, as Head, He merited
and paid in His members, that is, in holy and just men. Hence it can be seen how such great weight and dignity
belong to the good actions of the pious. For Christ our Lord continually infuses His grace into the devout soul
united to Him by charity, as the head to the members, or as the vine through the branches. This grace always
precedes, accompanies and follows our good works, and without it we can have no merit, nor can we at all
satisfy God.

Hence it is that nothing seems wanting to the just. Through their works done by the power of God, they are able,
on the one hand, to satisfy God's law, as far as their human and mortal condition will allow; and, on the other
hand, they can merit eternal life, to the fruition of which they will be admitted if they die in the state of God's
grace. Well known are the words of the Saviour: He that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not




                                                       188
thirst for ever; but the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life
everlasting.




Conditions for Satisfaction

In satisfaction two things are particularly required: the one, that he who satisfies be in a state of grace, the friend
of God, since works done without faith and charity cannot be acceptable to God; the other, that the works
performed be such as are of their own nature painful or laborious. They are a compensation for past sins, and, to
use the words of the holy martyr Cyprian, the redeemers, as it were, of past sins, and must, therefore, in some
way be disagreeable.

It does not, however, always follow that they are painful or laborious to those who undergo them. The influence
of habit, or the intensity of divine love, frequently renders the soul insensible to things the most difficult. Such
works, however, do not therefore cease to be satisfactory. It is the privilege of the children of God to be so
inflamed with His love, that while undergoing the most cruel tortures, they are either almost insensible to them,
or bear them all with the greatest joy.




Works Of Satisfaction Are Of Three Kinds

Pastors should teach that all kinds of satisfaction are reducible to three heads: prayer, fasting and almsdeeds,
which correspond to three kinds of goods which we have received from God, those of the soul, those of the
body and what are called external goods.

Nothing can be more effectual in uprooting all sin from the soul than these three kinds of satisfaction. For since
whatever is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life,
everyone can see that to these three causes of disease are opposed also three remedies. To the first is opposed
fasting; to the second, almsdeeds; to the third, prayer.

Moreover, if we consider those whom our sins injure, we shall easily perceive why all kinds of satisfaction are
reduced especially to these three. For those (we offend by our sins) are: God, our neighbour and ourselves. God
we appease by prayer, our neighbour we satisfy by alms, and ourselves we chastise by fasting.

As this life is chequered by many and various afflictions, the faithful are to be particularly reminded that those
who patiently bear all the trials and afflictions coming from the hand of God acquire abundant satisfaction and
merit; whereas those who suffer with reluctance and impatience deprive themselves of all the fruits of
satisfaction, merely enduring the punishment which the just judgment of God inflicts upon their sins.




One Can Satisfy For Another

In this the supreme mercy and goodness of God deserve our grateful acknowledgment and praise, that He has
granted to our frailty the privilege that one may satisfy for another. This, however, is a privilege which is
confined to the satisfactory part of Penance alone. As regards contrition and confession, no one is able to be
contrite for another; but those who are in the state of grace may pay for others what is due to God, and thus we
may be said in some measure to bear each other's burdens.

This is a doctrine on which the faithful cannot for a moment entertain a doubt, since we profess in the Apostle's
Creed our belief in the Communion of Saints. For since we are all reborn to Christ in the same cleansing waters


                                                         189
of Baptism and are partakers of the same Sacraments, and, above all, are nourished with the same body and
blood of Christ our Lord, as our food and drink, we are all, it is manifest, members of the same body. As then
the foot does not perform its functions solely for itself, but also for the sake of the eyes, and as the eyes see not
only for their own sake, but for the general good of all the members, so also works of satisfaction must be
considered common to us all.

This, however, is not true in reference to all the advantages to be derived from satisfaction. For works of
satisfaction are also medicinal, and are so many remedies prescribed to the penitent to heal the depraved
affections of the soul. It is clear that those who do not satisfy for themselves can have no share in this fruit of
penance.

These three parts of Penance, contrition, confession and satisfaction, should be fully and clearly explained.




Duties of the Confessor as Regards Satisfaction




Restitution Must Be Insisted On

Above all, priests should be very careful not to give absolution to any penitent, whose confession they have
heard, without obliging him to make full satisfaction for any injury to his neighbour’s goods or character for
which he seems responsible. No person is to be absolved until he has first faithfully promised to restore all that
belongs to others.

But as there are many who readily promise to comply with their duty in this respect, yet are deliberately
determined never to fulfil their promises, these persons should be obliged to make restitution, and the words of
the Apostle are to be frequently pressed upon their minds: He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather
let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that
suffereth need.




Quantity And Quality Of Penances Should Be Reasonable

In imposing penance priests should do nothing arbitrarily, but should be guided solely by justice, prudence and
piety. In order to show that they follow this rule, and also to impress more deeply on the mind of the penitent
the enormity of his sin, it will be useful sometimes to remind him of the severe punishments inflicted by the
ancient penitential canons, as they are called, for certain sins. The nature of the sin, therefore, will regulate the
extent of the satisfaction.

No satisfaction can be more salutary than to require of the penitent to devote, for a certain number of days,
some time to prayer, not omitting to pray to God in behalf of all mankind, and particularly for those who have
departed this life in the Lord.




Voluntary Works Of Penance Should Be Recommended

Penitents should also be exhorted to undertake of their own accord the frequent performance of the penances
imposed by the confessor, and thus so to conduct their lives that, having faithfully complied with everything
which the Sacrament of Penance demands, they may never cease earnestly to practice the virtue of penance.


                                                         190
PUBLIC PENANCES SHOULD SOMETIMES BE GIVEN

Should it be deemed proper sometimes to visit public crimes with public penance, and should the penitent
express great reluctance of seek to escape from its performance, he should not be listened to too readily, but
should be persuaded to embrace with cheerfulness and readiness that which will be salutary to himself and to
others.




Admonition

These things concerning the Sacrament of Penance and its several parts should be taught in such a manner as to
enable the faithful not only to understand them perfectly, but also, with the Lord's help, to resolve to put them in
practice piously and religiously.




                                THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION




Importance Of Instruction On Extreme Unction

In all thy works, the Scriptures teach, remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin, words which convey to
the pastor a silent admonition to omit no opportunity of exhorting the faithful to constant meditation on death.
The Sacrament of Extreme Unction, because inseparably associated with recollection of the day of death,
should, it is obvious, form a subject of frequent instruction, not only because it is right to explain the mysteries
of salvation, but also because death, the inevitable doom of all men, when recalled to the minds of the faithful,
represses depraved passion. Thus shall they be less disturbed by the approach of death, and will pour forth their
gratitude in endless praises to God, who has not only opened to us the way to true life in the Sacrament of
Baptism, but has also instituted that of Extreme Unction, to afford us, when departing this mortal life, an easier
way to heaven.




Names of this Sacrament

In explaining what is more necessary on this subject we shall follow almost the same order observed in the
exposition of the other Sacraments. Hence we shall first show that this Sacrament is called Extreme Unction,
because among all the unctions prescribed by our Lord to His Church, this is the last to be administered.

For this reason it was also called by our predecessors in the faith, the Sacrament of the anointing of the sick, and
also the Sacrament of the dying, names which easily turn the minds of the faithful to the remembrance of that
last hour.




Extreme Unction Is a True Sacrament

That Extreme Unction is strictly speaking a Sacrament, is first to be explained; and this the words of St. James
the Apostle, promulgating the law of this Sacrament, clearly establish. Is any man, he says, sick amongst you ?
Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the



                                                        191
Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man; and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be in sins, they
shall be forgiven him. When the Apostle says that sins are forgiven, he ascribes to Extreme Unction the nature
and efficacy of a Sacrament.

That such has been at all times the doctrine of the Catholic Church on Extreme Unction, many Councils testify,
and the Council of Trent denounces anathema against all who presume to teach or think otherwise. Innocent I
also recommends this Sacrament with great earnestness to the attention of the faithful.




Extreme Unction Is But One Sacrament

Pastors, therefore, should teach that Extreme Unction is a true Sacrament, and that, although administered with
many anointings, each given with a peculiar prayer, and under a peculiar form, it constitutes not many, but one
Sacrament. It is one, however, not in the sense that it is composed of inseparable parts, but because each of the
parts contributes to its perfection, as is the case with every object composed of many parts. As a house which
consists of a great variety of parts derives its perfection from unity of plan, so is this Sacrament, although
composed of many and different things and words, but one sign, and it effects only that one thing of which it is
the sign.




Essential Parts of Extreme Unction

Pastors should also teach what are the component parts of this Sacrament, its matter and form. These St. James
does not omit, and each is replete with its own peculiar mysteries.




The Matter Of Extreme Unction

Its element, then, or matter, as defined by Councils, particularly by the Council of Trent, consists of oil
consecrated by the Bishop. Not any kind of oil extracted from fatty or greasy substances, but olive oil alone
(can be the matter of this Sacrament).

Thus its matter is most significant of what is inwardly effected in the soul by the Sacrament. Oil is very
efficacious in soothing bodily pain, and the power of this Sacrament lessens the pain and anguish of the soul.
Oil also restores health, brings joy, feeds light, and is very efficacious in refreshing bodily fatigue. All these
effects signify what the divine power accomplishes in the sick man through the administration of this
Sacrament. So much will suffice in explanation of the matter.




The Form Of Extreme Unction

The form of the Sacrament is the word and solemn prayer which the priest uses at each anointing: By this Holy
Unction may God pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed by the evil use of sight, smell or touch.

That this is the true form of this Sacrament we learn from these words of St. James: Let them pray over him . . .
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. Hence we can see that the form is to be applied by way of
prayer. The Apostle does not say of what particular words that prayer is to consist; but this form has been
handed down to us by the faithful tradition of the Fathers, so that all the Churches retain the form observed by
the Church of Rome, the mother and mistress of all Churches. Some, it is true, alter a few words, as when for


                                                        192
God pardon thee, they say (God) remit, or (God) spare, and sometimes, May (God) remedy all the evil thou hast
committed. But as there is no change of meaning, it is clear that all religiously observe the same form.

It should not excite surprise that, while the form of each of the other Sacraments either absolutely signifies what
it expresses, such as I baptise thee, or I Sign thee with the sign of the cross, or is pronounced, as it were, by way
of command, as in administering Holy Orders, Receive power, the form of Extreme Unction alone is expressed
by way of prayer. Wisely has it been so appointed. For since this Sacrament is administered not only for the
spiritual grace which it bestows, but also for the recovery of health, which, however, is not always obtained,
therefore use a deprecative form, in order to implore of God's mercy what the virtue of the Sacrament does not
always and uniformly effect.




The Ceremonies Of Extreme Unction

In the administration of this Sacrament special rites are also used, consisting principally of prayers offered by
the priest for the recovery of the sick person. There is no Sacrament, the administration of which is
accompanied with more numerous prayers; and with good reason, for at that moment more than ever the faithful
require the assistance of pious prayers. All who may be present, and especially the pastor, should pour out their
fervent aspirations to God, and earnestly commend to His mercy the life and salvation of the sufferer.




Institution of Extreme Unction

Having thus proved that Extreme Unction is truly and properly to be numbered among the Sacraments, we
rightly infer that it owes its institution to Christ our Lord. It was subsequently made known and promulgated to
the faithful by the Apostle St. James.

Our Saviour Himself, however, seems to have given some indication of it, when He sent His disciples two and
two before Him; for the Evangelist informs us that going forth, they preached that all should do penance; and
they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.

This anointing cannot be supposed to have been invented by the Apostles, but was commanded by our Lord.
Nor did its power arise from any natural virtue. Its efficacy, we must believe, was mystical, having been
instituted to heal the maladies of the soul, rather than to cure the diseases of the body. This is the doctrine taught
by St. Denis, St. Ambrose, St. Chrysostom and St. Gregory the Great; so that it cannot be at all doubted that
Extreme Unction is to be recognised and venerated as one of the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church.




The Subject of Extreme Unction

But although instituted for the use of all, Extreme Unction is not lo be administered indiscriminately to all.




The Subject Must Be In Danger Of Death

In the first place, it is not to be administered to persons in sound health, according to these words of St. James:
Is anyone sick amongst you? This is also proved by the fact that Extreme Unction was instituted as a remedy
not only for the diseases of the soul, but also for those of the body. Now only the sick need a remedy, and



                                                        193
therefore this Sacrament is to be administered to those only whose malady is such as to excite apprehensions of
approaching death.

It is, however, a very grievous sin to defer the Holy Unction until, all hope of recovery being lost, life begins to
ebb, and the sick person is fast verging into a state of insensibility. It is obvious that if the Sacrament is
administered while consciousness and reason are yet unimpaired, and the mind is capable of eliciting acts of
faith and of directing the will to sentiments of piety, a more abundant participation of its graces must be
received. Though this heavenly medicine is in itself always salutary, pastors should be careful to apply it when
its efficacy can be aided by the piety and devotion of the sick person.




The Danger Must Arise From Sickness

Extreme Unction, then, can be administered to no one who is not dangerously sick; not even to those who are in
danger of death, as when they undertake a perilous voyage, or enter into battle with the sure prospect of death,
or have been condemned to death and are on the way to execution.




The Person Anointed Must Have Attained The Use Of Reason

Furthermore, all those who have not the use of reason are not fit subjects for this Sacrament; and likewise
children who, having committed no sins, do not need the Sacrament as a remedy against the remains of sin. The
same is true of idiots and insane persons, unless they give indications in their lucid intervals of a disposition to
piety, and express a desire to be anointed. To persons who from their birth never enjoyed the use of reason this
Sacrament is not to be administered; but if a sick person, while in the possession of his faculties, expresses a
wish to receive Extreme Unction and afterwards becomes delirious he is to be anointed.




Administration of Extreme Unction

The Sacred Unction is to be applied not to the entire body, but to the organs of sense only, -- to the eyes, on
account of sight; to the ears, on account of hearing; to the nostrils, on account of smell; to the mouth, on account
of taste and speech; to the hands, on account of touch. The sense of touch, it is true, is diffused throughout the
entire body, yet it is more developed in the hands.

This manner of administering Extreme Unction is observed throughout the universal Church, and is in keeping
with the medicinal nature of the Sacrament. As in corporal disease, although the malady affects the entire body,
yet the cure is applied to that part only which is the seat and origin of the disease; so likewise this Sacrament is
applied not to the entire body, but to those members in which the power of sensation is most conspicuous, and
also to the loins, which are, as it were, the seat of concupiscence, and to the feet, by which we move from one
place to another.

Here it is to be observed that, during the same illness, and while the danger of dying continues the same, the
sick person is to be anointed but once. Should he, however, recover after he has been anointed, he may receive
the aid of this Sacrament as often as he shall have relapsed into the same danger of death. This Sacrament,
therefore, is evidently to be numbered among those which may be repeated.




Dispositions for the Reception of Extreme Unction


                                                        194
As all care should be taken that nothing impede the. grace of the Sacrament, and as nothing is more opposed to
it than the consciousness of mortal guilt, the constant practice of the Catholic Church must be observed of
administering the Sacrament of Penance and the Eucharist before Extreme Unction.

And next, let parish priests strive to persuade the sick person to receive this Sacrament from the priest with the
same faith with which those of old who were to be healed by the Apostles used to present themselves. But the
salvation of his soul is to be the first object of the sick man's wishes, and after that the health of the body, with
this qualification, if it be for the good of his soul.

Nor should the faithful doubt that those holy and solemn prayers which are used by the priest, not in his own
person, but in that of the Church and of our Lord Jesus Christ, are heard by God; and they are most particularly
to be exhorted on this one point, to take care that the Sacrament of this most salutary oil be administered to
them holily and religiously, when the sharper conflict seems at hand, and the energies of the mind as well as of
the body appear to be failing.




The Minister of Extreme Unction

Who the minister of Extreme Unction is we learn from the same Apostle that promulgated the law of the Lord;
for he says: Let him bring in the priests (presbyters). By which name, as the Council of Trent has well
explained, he does not mean persons advanced in years, or of chief authority among the people, but priests who
have been duly ordained by Bishops with the imposition of hands.

To the priest, therefore, has been committed the administration of this Sacrament; not, however, to every priest,
as holy Church has decreed, but to the proper pastor who has jurisdiction, or to another authorised by him to
discharge this office.

In this, however, as also in the administration of the other Sacraments, it is to be most distinctly remembered
that the priest is the representative of Christ our Lord, and of His spouse, holy Church.




The Effects of Extreme Unction

The advantages we receive from this Sacrament are also to be accurately explained, so that if nothing else can
allure the faithful to its reception, they may be induced at least by its utility; for we are naturally disposed to
measure almost all things by our interests.

Pastors, therefore, should teach that by this Sacrament is imparted grace that remits sins, and especially lighter,
or as they are commonly called, venial sins; for mortal sins are removed by the Sacrament of Penance. Extreme
Unction was not instituted primarily for the remission of grave offences; only Baptism and Penance accomplish
this directly.

Another advantage of the Sacred Unction is that it liberates the soul from the languor and infirmity which it
contracted from sins, and from all the other remains of sin. The time most opportune for this cure is when we
are afflicted with severe illness and danger to life impends, for it has been implanted in man by nature to dread
no human visitation so much as death. This dread is greatly augmented by the recollection of our past sins,
especially if our conscience accuses us of grave offences; for it is written: They shall come with fear at the
thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them. Another source of vehement
anguish is the anxious thought that we must soon afterwards stand before the judgment seat of God, who will
pass on us a sentence of strictest justice according to our deserts. It often happens that, struck with this terror,
the faithful feel themselves deeply agitated; and nothing conduces more to a tranquil death than to banish



                                                         195
sadness, await with a joyous mind the coming of our Lord, and be ready willingly to surrender the deposit
entrusted whenever it shall be His will to demand it back. To free the minds of the faithful from this solicitude,
and fill the soul with pious and holy joy is, then, an effect of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction.

From it, moreover, we derive another advantage, which may justly be deemed the greatest of all. For although
the enemy of the human race never ceases, while we live, to meditate our ruin and destruction, yet at no time
does he more violently use every effort utterly to destroy us, and, if possible, deprive us of all hope of the divine
mercy, than when he sees the last day of life approach. Therefore arms and strength are supplied to the faithful
in this Sacrament to enable them to break the violence and impetuosity of the adversary, and to fight bravely
against him; for the soul of the sick is relieved and encouraged by the hope of the divine goodness, strengthened
by which it bears more lightly ail the burdens of sickness, and eludes with greater ease the artifice and cunning
of the devil who lies in wait for it.

Finally, the recovery of health, if indeed advantageous, is another effect of this Sacrament. And if in our days
the sick obtain this effect less frequently, this is to be attributed, not to any defect of the Sacrament, but rather to
the weaker faith of a great part of those who are anointed with the sacred oil, or by whom it is administered; for
the Evangelist bears witness that the Lord wrought not many miracles among His own, because of their
unbelief.

It may also be truly said at the Christian religion, since it has struck its roots more deeply in the minds of men,
stands now less in need of the aids of such miracles than it did formerly, at the commencement of the rising
Church. Nevertheless, faith should be strongly excited in this respect, and whatever it may please God in His
wisdom to do with regard to the health of the body, the faithful ought to rely on a sure hope of attaining, by
virtue of this sacred oil, health of the soul, and of experiencing, should the hour of their departure from life be at
hand, the fruit of that glorious assurance: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.




Admonition

We have thus explained briefly the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. But if these points are developed by the
pastor at greater length and with the care the subject demands, it is not to be doubted that the faithful will derive
very great fruit of piety from his instruction.




                                    THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS




Importance Of Instruction On This Sacrament

If one attentively considers the nature and essence of the other Sacraments, it will readily be seen that they all
depend on the Sacrament of Orders to such an extent that without it some of them could not be constituted or
administered at all; while others would be deprived of all their solemn ceremonies, as well as of a certain part of
the religious respect and exterior honour accorded to them. Wherefore in continuing the exposition of the
doctrine of the Sacraments, it will be necessary for pastors to bear in mind that it is their duty to explain with
even special care the Sacrament of Orders.

This explanation will be highly advantageous. First of all to the pastor himself, then to all those who have
entered on the ecclesiastical state, and finally to the people in general. To the pastor himself, because by treating
of this subject he himself will be more deeply moved to stir up within him the grace he has received in this
Sacrament; to those who have been called to the portion of the Lord, partly by animating them with a like spirit



                                                         196
of piety, and partly by affording them an opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of such things as will enable
them all the more easily to advance to higher orders; to the rest of the faithful, first, because it enables them to
understand the respect due to the Church's ministers, and secondly, because as it often happens that many may
be present who have destined their children, while yet young, for the Church's service, or who desire to embrace
that life themselves, it is far from right that such persons should be unacquainted with the principal truths
regarding this particular state.




Dignity of this Sacrament

In the first place, then, the faithful should be shown how great is the dignity and excellence of this Sacrament
considered in its highest degree, the priesthood.

Bishops and priests being, as they are, God's interpreters and ambassadors, empowered in His name to teach
mankind the divine law and the rules of conduct, and holding, as they do, His place on earth, it is evident that no
nobler function than theirs can be imagined. Justly, therefore, are they called not only Angels, but even gods,
because of the fact that they exercise in our midst the power and prerogatives of the immortal God.

In all ages, priests have been held in the highest honour; yet the priests of the New Testament far exceed all
others. For the power of consecrating and offering the body and blood of our Lord and of forgiving sins, which
has been conferred on them, not only has nothing equal or like to it on earth, but even surpasses human reason
and understanding.

And as our Saviour was sent by His Father, and as the Apostles and disciples were sent into the whole world by
Christ our Lord, so priests are daily sent with the same powers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of
the ministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ.




Requirements in Candidates for Orders




Holiness, Knowledge, Prudence

The burden of this great office, therefore, should not be rashly imposed on anyone, but is to be conferred on
those only who by their holiness of life, their knowledge, faith and prudence, are able to bear it.




Divine Call

Let no one take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God as Aaron was; and they are called by God
who are

called by the lawful ministers of His Church. It is to those who arrogantly intrude themselves into this ministry
that the Lord must be understood to refer when He says: I did not send prophets, yet they ran. Nothing can be
more unhappy and wretched than such a class of men as this, and nothing more calamitous to the Church of
God.




                                                       197
Right Intention

In every action we undertake it is of the highest importance to have a good motive in view, for if the motive is
good, the rest proceeds harmoniously. The candidate for Holy Orders, therefore, should first of all be
admonished to entertain no purpose unworthy of so exalted an office.

This subject demands all the greater attention, since in these days the faithful often sin gravely in this respect.
Some there are who embrace this state to secure the necessaries of life, and who, consequently, seek in the
priesthood, just as other men do in the lowest walks of life, nothing more or less than gain. Though both the
natural and divine law lay down, as the Apostle remarks, that he who serves the altar should live by the altar;
yet to approach the altar for the sake of gain and money is one of the very gravest of sacrileges.

Some are attracted to the priesthood by ambition and love of honours; while there are others who desire to be
ordained simply in order that they may abound in riches, as is proved by the fact that unless some wealthy
benefice were conferred on them, they would not dream of receiving Holy Orders. It is such as these that our
Saviour describes as hirelings, who, in the words of Ezechiel, feed themselves and not the sheep, and whose
baseness and dishonesty have not only brought great disgrace on the ecclesiastical state, so much so that hardly
anything is now more vile and contemptible in the eyes of the faithful, but also end in this, that they derive no
other fruit from their priesthood than was derived by Judas from the Apostleship, which only brought him
everlasting destruction.

But they, on the other hand, who are lawfully called by God, and who undertake the ecclesiastical state with the
single motive of promoting the honour of God, are truly said to enter the Church by the door.

This, however, must not be understood as if the same law did not bind all men equally. Men have been created
to honour God, and this the faithful in particular, who have obtained the grace of Baptism, should do with their
whole heart, their whole soul, and with all their strength.

But those who desire to receive the Sacrament of Orders, should aim not only at seeking the glory of God in all
things-an obligation admittedly common to all men, and particularly to the faithful -- but also to serve Him in
holiness and justice in whatever sphere of His ministry they may be placed. Just as in the army all the soldiers
obey the general's orders, though they all have not the same functions to discharge, one being a centurion,
another a prefect, so in like manner, though all the faithful should diligently practice piety and innocence, which
are the chief means of honouring God, yet they who are in Holy Otters have certain special duties and functions
to discharge in the Church. Thus they offer Sacrifice for themselves and for all the people; they explain God's
law and exhort and form the faithful to observe it promptly and cheerfully; they administer the Sacraments of
Christ our Lord by means of which all grace is conferred and increased; and, in a word, they are separated from
the rest of the people to fill by far the greatest and noblest of all ministries.




The Twofold Power Conferred by this Sacrament

Having explained all this, the pastor should now turn his attention to the special properties of this Sacrament, so
that the faithful who desire to enter into the ecclesiastical state may understand the nature of the office to which
they are called and the extent of the power bestowed by God on the Church and her ministers.

This power is twofold: the powers of orders and the power of jurisdiction. The power of orders has for its object
the real body of Christ our Lord in the Blessed Eucharist. The power of jurisdiction refers altogether to the
mystical body of (Christ. The scope of this power is to govern and rule the Christian people, and lead them to
the unending bliss of heaven.




                                                        198
The Power Of Orders

The power of orders not only embraces the power of consecrating the Eucharist, but also fits and prepares the
souls of men for its reception. It also embraces all else that can have any reference to the Eucharist. Regarding
this power numerous passages of Sacred Scripture may be adduced; but the weightiest and most striking are
those which are read in St. John and St. Matthew: As the Father, says our Lord, hath sent me I also send you. ....
Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain
they are retained; and: Amen, I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall be bound also in heaven;
and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth shall be loosed a also in heaven. These texts, when expounded by
pastors, in accordance with the teaching and authority of the Fathers, will throw great light on this truth.




Greatness Of This Power

This power far excels that given under the law of nature to certain ones who had charge of sacred things. The
period previous to the written law must have had its priesthood and its spiritual power, since it is certain that it
had its law; for these two, as the Apostle testifies, are so closely connected that if the priesthood is transferred,
the law must necessarily be transferred also. Guided, therefore, by a natural instinct, men recognised that God is
to be worshipped; and hence it follows that in every nation some, whose power might in a certain sense be
called spiritual, were given the care of sacred things and of divine worship.

This power was also possessed by the Jews; but though it was superior in dignity to that with which priests were
invested under the law of nature, yet it must be regarded as far inferior to the spiritual power that is found in the
New Law. For the latter is heavenly, and surpasses all the power of Angels; it is derived not from the Mosaic
priesthood, but from Christ our Lord who was a priest, not according to the order of Aaron, but according to the
order of Melchisedech. For He it is who, Himself endowed with the supreme power of granting grace and
remitting sins, left to His Church this power, although He limited it in extent and attached it to the Sacraments.




Names of this Sacrament

Hence to exercise this power certain ministers are appointed and solemnly consecrated, which consecration is
called the Sacrament of Orders, or Sacred Ordination. The Fathers used this word, which in itself has a most
extensive signification, to show the dignity and excellence of God's ministers.

In fact, order, when understood in its strict meaning and acceptation, is the arrangement of superior and inferior
things so disposed as to stand in mutual relation towards each other. Now as in this ministry there are many
grades and various functions, and as all these are disposed and arranged according to a definite plan, the name
Order has been well and properly applied to it.




Holy Orders Is a Sacrament

That Sacred Ordination is to be numbered among the Sacraments of the Church, the Council of Trent has
established by the same line of reasoning as we have already used several times. Since a Sacrament is a sign of
a sacred thing, and since the outward action in this consecration denotes the grace and power bestowed on him
who is consecrated, it becomes clearly evident that Order must be truly and properly regarded as a Sacrament.
Thus the Bishop, handing to him who is being ordained a chalice with wine and water, and a paten with bread,
says: Receive the power of offering sacrifice, etc. In these words, pronounced along with the application of the
matter, the Church has always taught that the power of consecrating the Eucharist is conferred, and that a



                                                        199
character is impressed on the soul which brings with it grace necessary for the due and proper discharge of that
office, as the Apostle declares thus: I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee, by the
imposition of my hands; for God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of sobriety.




Number of Orders

Now, to use the words of the holy Council: The ministry of so sublime a priesthood being a thing all divine, it is
but befitting its worthier and more reverent exercise that in the Church's well-ordered disposition there should
be several different orders of ministers destined to assist the priesthood by virtue of their office, -- orders
arranged in such a way that those who have already received clerical tonsure should be raised, step by step,
from the lower to the higher orders.

It should be taught, therefore, that these orders are seven in number, and that this has been the constant teaching
of the Catholic Church. These orders are those of porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon and priest.

That the number of ministers was wisely established thus may be proved by considering the various offices that
are necessary for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the consecration and administration of
the Blessed Eucharist, this being the principal scope of their institution.

They are divided into major or sacred, and minor orders. The major or sacred orders are priesthood, deaconship
and subdeaconship; while the minor orders are those of acolyte, exorcist, lector and porter, concerning each of
which we shall now say a few words so that the pastor may be able to explain them to those especially whom he
knows to be about to receive any of the orders in question.




Tonsure

In the beginning should be explained first tonsure, and it should be shown that this is a sort of preparation for
the reception of orders. As men are prepared for Baptism by exorcisms and for Matrimony by engagement, so to
those who dedicate themselves to God by tonsure the way is opened that leads to the Sacrament of Orders; for
by the cutting off of hair is signified the character and disposition of him who desires to devote himself to the
sacred ministry.




The Name "Cleric"

Regarding the name cleric, which is then given him for the first time, it is derived from the fact that he thereby
begins to take the Lord for his lot and inheritance, just as those, who among the Jews were attached to the
service of God, were forbidden by the Lord to have any part of the ground that would be distributed in the land
of promise: , he said, am thy portion and inheritance. And although these words are true of all the faithful, yet it
is certain that they apply in a special way to those who consecrate themselves to the service of God.




Origin And Meaning Of Tonsure

The hair of the head is cut off in the form of a crown. It should be always worn thus, and should be enlarged
according as one is advanced to higher orders.



                                                        200
The Church teaches that this usage is derived from Apostolic origin, as mention is made of it by the most
ancient and authoritative Fathers, such as St. Denis the Areopagite, St. Augustine and St. Jerome.

It is said that the Prince of the Apostles first introduced this usage in memory of the crown of thorns which was
put upon our Saviour's head, so that the devices resorted to by the impious for the ignominy and torture of
Christ might be used by His Apostles a sign of honour and glory, as well as to signify that the ministers of the
Church should strive to resemble Christ our Lord and represent Him in all things.

Some, however, assert that by tonsure is denoted the royal dignity, that is, the portion reserved especially for
those who are called to the inheritance of the Lord. It will readily be seen that what the Apostle Peter says of all
the faithful: You are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, applies especially and with much
greater reason to the ministers of the Church.

Still there are some who consider that by the circle, which is the most perfect of all figures, is signified the
profession of a more perfect life undertaken by ecclesiastics; while in view of the fact that the hair of their
heads, which is a kind of bodily superfluity, is cut off, others think that it denotes contempt for external things,
and detachment of soul from all human cares.




The Minor Orders




Porter

After tonsure it is customary to advance to the first order, which is that of porter. The function (of porter) is to
guard the keys and doors of the church, and to allow no one to enter there to whom access has been forbidden.
Formerly the porter used to assist at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, to see that no one approached too near the
altar, or disturbed the priest during the celebration of the divine mysteries. Other duties were also assigned to
him, as may be seen from the ceremonies used at his ordination.

Thus the Bishop, taking the keys from the altar, hands them to him who is being made porter, and says: Let your
conduct be that of one who has to render to God an account of those things that are kept under these keys.

How great was the dignity of this order in the ancient Church may be inferred from a usage which exists in the
Church in these times. For the office of treasurer, which is still numbered among the more honourable functions
of the Church, was entrusted to porters, and carried with it also the guardianship of the sacristy.




Reader

The second degree of orders is the office of reader, whose duty it is to read in the church in a clear and distinct
voice the books of the Old and of the New Testament, and especially those which are read during the nocturnal
psalmody. Formerly it was also his duty to teach the faithful the first rudiments of the Christian religion.

Hence it is that when ordaining him, the Bishop, in the presence of the people, handing him a book in which are
set down all that regards this office, says: Take, and be you an announcer of the word of God; if you faithfully
and profitably discharge your office, you shall have a part with those who from the be- ginning have well
ministered the word of God.




                                                        201
Exorcist

The third order is that of exorcists, to whom is given the power to invoke the name of the Lord over those who
are possessed by unclean spirits. Hence the Bishop when ordaining them presents to them a book in which the
exorcisms are contained, and at the same time pronounces this form of words: Take, and commit to memory,
and have the power of imposing hands over the possessed, whether baptised or catechumen.




Acolyte

The fourth degree is that of acolytes, and it is the last of the orders that are called minor and not sacred. Their
duty is to attend and serve the ministers who are in major orders, that is, the deacon and subdeacon, in the
Sacrifice of the altar. They also carry and attend to the lights during the celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass,
and especially during the reading of the Gospel, from which fact they are also called candle-bearers.

Therefore at the ordination of acolytes the Bishop observes the following rite: First of all he carefully warns
them of the nature of their office; then hands to each of them a light, saying: Receive this candlestick and
candle, and remember that henceforth you are given the charge of lighting the candles of the church, in the
name of the Lord. Then he hands them empty cruets in which are presented the wine and water for the Sacrifice,
saying: Receive these cruets to supply wine and water for t) c Eucharist of Christ's blood, in the name of the
Lord.




The Major Orders




Subdeacon

From the minor orders, which are not sacred, and of which we have been speaking until now, one lawfully
enters and ascends to major and Sacred Orders.

Now the subdiaconate is the first degree of (major orders). Its function, as the name itself indicates, is to serve
the deacon at the altar. It is the subdeacon who should prepare the altar linen, the vessels and the bread and wine
necessary for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice. He also it is who presents water to the Bishop or priest when
he washes his hands during the Sacrifice of the Mass. It is also the subdeacon who now reads the Epistle which
in former times was read at Mass by the deacon. He assists as witness at the Holy Sacrifice, and guards the
celebrant from being disturbed by anyone during the sacred ceremonies.

The various duties that pertain to the subdeacon are indicated by the solemn ceremonies used at his ordination.
In the first place the Bishop warns him that the obligation of perpetual continence is attached to this order, and
declares that no one is to be admitted among the subdeacons who is not ready and willing to accept the
obligation in question. Then, after the solemn recitation of the Litanies, the Bishop enumerates and explains the
duties and functions of the subdeacon. Thereupon each one of those who are being ordained receives the chalice
and sacred paten from the Bishop; and, to show that he is to serve the deacon, the subdeacon receives from the
archdeacon cruets filled with wine and water, together with a basin and towel with which to wash and dry the
hands. At the same time the Bishop pronounces these words: See what sort of ministry is entrusted to you; I
admonish you therefore, to show yourself worthy to please God. Other prayers follow, and finally, when the
Bishop has clothed the subdeacon with the sacred vestments, for each of which there are special words and
ceremonies, he gives kiln the book of the Epistles, saying: Receive the book of the Epistles with power to read
them in the Holy Church of God, as well for the living as for the dead.



                                                        202
Deacon

The second degree of Sacred Orders is that of the deacons, whose functions are much more extensive and have
always been regarded as more holy. His duty it is to be always at the side of the Bishop, guard him while he
preaches, serve him and the priest during the celebration of the divine mysteries, as well as during the
administration of the Sacraments, and to read the Gospel in the Sacrifice of the Mass. In former times he
frequently warned the faithful to be attentive to the holy mysteries; he administered our Lord's blood in those
churches in which the custom existed that the faithful should receive the Eucharist under both species; and to
him was entrusted the distribution of the Church's goods, as well as the duty of providing for all that was
necessary to each one's sustenance. To the deacon also, as the eye of the Bishop, it belongs to see who they are
in the city a that lead a good and holy life, and who not; who are present at the Holy Sacrifice and sermons at
appointed times, and who not; so that he may be able to give an account of all to the Bishop, and enable him to
admonish and advise each one privately, or to rebuke and correct publicly, according as he may deem more
profitable. He should also read out the list of the catechumens and present to the Bishop those who are to be
admitted to orders. Finally in the absence of a Bishop or priest, he can explain the Gospel, but not from the
pulpit, thus letting it be seen that this is not his proper office.

The Apostle shows the great care that should be taken that no one unworthy of the diaconate be promoted to this
order, when in his Epistle to Timothy he sets forth a deacon's character, virtues and integrity. The same point is
also gathered from the rites and solemn ceremonies which the Bishop employs when ordaining him. The Bishop
uses more numerous and more solemn prayers at the ordination of a deacon than at that of a subdeacon, and he
also adds other kinds of sacred vestments. Moreover, he imposes hands on him, just as we read the Apostles
used to do when ordaining the first deacons. Finally, he hands him the book of the Gospels, with these words:
Receive the power to read the Gospel in the Church of God both for the living and the dead in the name of the
Lord.




Priest

The third and highest degree of all Sacred Orders is the priesthood. The Fathers of the first centuries usually
designated those who had received this order by two names. At one time they called them presbyters -- a Greek
word signifying elders, not only because of the ripe years very necessary for this order, but much more on
account of their gravity, knowledge and prudence; for it is written: Venerable old age is not that of long time
nor counted by the number of years; but the understanding of a man is grey hairs and an unspotted life is old
age. At other times they call them priests, both because they are consecrated to God, and because to them it
belongs to administer the Sacraments and take charge of things sacred and divine.




Twofold Priesthood

But as Sacred Scripture describes a twofold priesthood, one internal and the other external, it will be necessary
to have a distinct idea of each to enable pastors to explain the nature of the priesthood now under discussion.




The Internal Priesthood

Regarding the internal priesthood, all the faithful are said to be priests, once they have been washed in the
saving waters of Baptism. Especially is this name given to the just who have the Spirit of God, and who, by the



                                                       203
help of divine grace, have been made living members of the great High-priest, Jesus Christ; for, enlightened by
faith which is inflamed by charity, they offer tip spiritual sacrifices to God on the altar of their hearts. Among
such sacrifices must be reckoned every good and virtuous action done for the glory of God.

Hence we read in the Apocalypse: Christ hath washed us front our sins. in his own blood and hath made us a
kingdom, and priests to God and his Father. In like manner was it said by the Prince of the Apostles: Be you
also as living stones built up, a spiritual house a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
God by Jesus Christ; while the Apostle exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice holy , pleasing unto
God your reasonable service. And long before this David had said: A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a
contrite and humble heart O God thou wilt not despise. All this clearly regards the internal priesthood.




The External Priesthood

The external priesthood, on the contrary, does not pertain to the faithful at large, but only to certain men who
have been ordained and consecrated to God by the lawful imposition of hands and by the solemn ceremonies of
holy Church, and who are thereby devoted to a particular sacred ministry.

This distinction of the priesthood can be seen even in the Old Law. That David spoke of the internal priesthood,
we have just shown. On the other hand, everyone knows the many and various precepts given by the Lord to
Moses and Aaron regarding the external priesthood. Along with this He appointed the whole tribe of Levi to the
ministry of the Temple, and He forbade by law that anyone belonging to another tribe should dare to intrude
himself into that function. Hence it was that King Ozias was afflicted with leprosy by the Lord for having
usurped the sacerdotal ministry, and had to suffer grave chastisements for his arrogance and sacrilege.

Now as the same distinction (of a twofold) priesthood may be noted in the New Law, the faithful should be
cautioned that what we are now about to say concerns that external priesthood which is conferred on certain
special individuals. This alone belongs to the Sacrament of Holy Orders.




Functions of the Priesthood

The office of a priest, then, is to offer Sacrifice to God and to administer the Sacraments of the Church. This is
proved by the very ceremonies used at his ordination. When-ordaining a priest, the Bishop first of all imposes
hands on him, as do all the other priests who are present. Then he puts a stole on his shoulders and arranges it
over his breast in the form of a cross, declaring thereby that the priest is clothed with power from on high,
enabling him to carry the cross of Christ our Lord and the sweet yoke of God's law, and to inculcate this law not
only by words, but also by the example of a most holy and virtuous life.

He next anoints his hands with holy oil, and then gives him the chalice with wine and the paten with a host,
saying at the same time: Receive the power to offer Sacrifice to God and to celebrate Masses both for the living
and for the dead. By these words and ceremonies the priest is constituted an interpreter and mediator between
God and man, which indeed must be regarded as the principal function of the priesthood.

Lastly, placing his hands a second time on the head (of the person ordained the Bishop) says: Receive the Holy
Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain they are retained,
thus communicating to him that divine power of forgiving and retaining sin which was given by our Lord to His
disciples. Such, then, are the special and principal functions of the sacerdotal order.




                                                        204
Degrees of the Priesthood




Priests

Now although (the sacerdotal order) is one alone, yet it has various degrees of dignity and power. The first
degree is that of those who are simply called priests, and of whose functions we have hitherto been speaking.




Bishops

The second is that of Bishops, who are placed over the various dioceses to govern not only the other ministers
of the Church, but the faithful also, and to promote their salvation with supreme vigilance and care. Hence it is
that in Sacred Scripture they are often called pastors of the sheep. Their office and duty has been well described
by St. Paul in his sermon to the Ephesians, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles; while St. Peter, the Prince of
the Apostles, has also laid down a divine rule for the exercise of the episcopal office. And if Bishops strive to
conform their actions according to this rule, there can be no doubt that they will be good pastors and will be also
esteemed as such. Bishops are also called pontiffs. This name is derived from the pagans, who thus designated
their chief priests.




Archbishops

The third degree is that of Archbishops, who preside over a number of Bishops and who are called
Metropolitans, because they are Bishops of those cities which are regarded as the metropolis of their respective
provinces. Hence they enjoy greater dignity and more extensive power than Bishops, although their Ordination
is the same.




Patriarchs

In the fourth degree come Patriarchs, that is to say, the first and highest of the Fathers. Formerly, besides the
Roman Pontiff, there were in the universal Church only four Patriarchs, who, however, were not of equal
dignity. Thus Constantinople, though it reached the patriarchal honour only after all the others, yet it obtained a
higher rank by reason of being the capital of the Empire. Next in rank came the Patriarch of Alexandria, which
Church had been founded by St. Mark the Evangelist by order of the Prince of the Apostles. The third was that
of Antioch, where Peter fixed his first See. Finally, that of Jerusalem, a See first governed by James, the brother
of our Lord.




The Pope

Above all these, the Catholic Church has always placed the Supreme Pontiff of Rome, whom Cyril of
Alexandria, in the Council of Ephesus, named the Chief Bishop, Father and Patriarch of the whole world. He
sits in that chair of Peter in which beyond every shadow of doubt the Prince of the Apostles sat to the end of his
days, and hence it is that in him the Church recognises the highest degree of dignity, and a universality of
jurisdiction derived, not from the decrees of men or Councils, but from God Himself. Wherefore he is the
Father and guide of all the faithful, of all the Bishops, and of all the prelates, no matter how high their power


                                                       205
and office; and as successor of St. Peter, as true and lawful Vicar of Christ our Lord, he governs the universal
Church.

From what has been said, therefore, pastors should teach what are the principal duties and functions of the
various ecclesiastical orders and degrees, and also who is the minister of this Sacrament.




The Minister of Holy Orders

Beyond all doubt, it is to the Bishop that the administration (of orders) belongs, as is easily proved by the
authority of Holy Scripture, by most certain tradition, by the testimony of all the Fathers, by the decrees of the
Councils, and by the usage and practice of Holy Church.

It is true that permission has been granted to some abbots occasionally to administer those orders that are minor
and not sacred; yet there is no doubt whatever that it is the proper office of the Bishop, and of the Bishop alone
to confer the orders called holy or major.

To ordain subdeacons, deacons and priests, one Bishop suffices; but in accordance with an Apostolic tradition
that has been always observed in the Church, Bishops are consecrated by three Bishops.




The Recipient of Holy Orders

We now come to indicate who are fit to receive this Sacrament, and especially the priestly order, and what are
the principal dispositions required of them.

From (what we shall lay down concerning the dispositions requisite for the priesthood) it will be easy to
determine what ought to be observed in conferring the other orders, due account being taken of the office and
dignity of each. Now the extreme caution I hat should be used in conferring this Sacrament is gathered from the
fact that, while all the other Sacraments impart grace to the recipient for his own use and sanctification, he, on
the other hand, who receives Holy Orders is made partaker of heavenly grace precisely that by his ministry he
may promote the welfare of the Church and therefore of all mankind.

Hence we readily understand why it is that ordinations take place only on special days, on which, moreover, in
accordance with a very ancient practice of the Catholic Church, a solemn fast is appointed in order that by holy
and fervent prayer the faithful may obtain from God ministers who will be well qualified to exercise properly
and to the advantage of the Church the power of so great a ministry.




Qualifications for the Priesthood




Holiness Of Life

The chief and most necessary quality requisite in him who is to be ordained a priest is that he be recommended
by integrity of life and morals: first because, by procuring or permitting his ordination while conscious of
mortal sin, a man renders himself guilty of a new and enormous crime; and secondly, because the priest is
bound to give to others the example of a holy and innocent life.



                                                        206
In this connection pastors should set forth the rules which the Apostle laid down to Titus and Timothy, and he
should also explain that those bodily defects, which, by the Lord's command excluded from the service of the
altar in the Old Law, should for the most part be understood of deformities of soul in the New Law. This is why
the holy custom has been established in the Church that he who is about to be admitted to orders should first
take great care to cleanse his conscience in the Sacrament of Penance.




Competent Knowledge

In the second place there is required of the priest not only that knowledge which concerns the use and
administration of the Sacraments; but he should also be versed in the science of Sacred Scripture, so as to be
able to instruct the people in the mysteries of the Christian faith and the precepts of the divine law, lead them to
piety and virtue, and reclaim them from sin.

The priest's duties are twofold. The first is to consecrate and administer the Sacraments properly; the second is
to instruct the people entrusted to him in all that they must know or do in order to be saved. Hence the words of
the Prophet Malachias: The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the Law at his mouth;
because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.

Now to fulfil the first of these duties it is enough for him to be endowed with a moderate share of knowledge.
As for the second, it is no mere ordinary, but very special knowledge that is required. At the same time,
however, it should be remembered that a profound knowledge of abstruse questions is not demanded of all
priests in an equal degree. It is enough that each one knows all that is necessary for the discharge of his office
and ministry.




Canonical Fitness

This Sacrament should not be conferred on children, nor on the insane or mad, because they are devoid of the
use of reason. Yet if it does happen to be administered to them, we must unhesitatingly believe that the
sacramental character becomes impressed on their souls. As for the precise age requisite for the reception of the
various orders, this will easily be found in the decrees of the Council of Trent.

Slaves also are excluded. He who is not his own master and who is in the power of another, should not be
dedicated to the divine service.

Homicides and men of blood are also rejected, because they are excluded by a law of the Church and are
declared irregular.

The same must be said of the illegitimate and of all those not born in lawful wedlock. It is only right that those
who are dedicated to the divine service should have nothing in them which could expose them to the well-
deserved derision or contempt of others.

Finally, those who are notably maimed or deformed should not be admitted. A defect or deformity of this kind
cannot but offend the eye and stand in the way of the due administration of the Sacraments.




Effects of Holy Orders




                                                        207
This much being explained, it now remains for pastors to point out the effects of this Sacrament. It is evident
that the Sacrament of Orders, while mainly concerned, as already explained, with the welfare and beauty of the
Church, nevertheless also confers on the soul of him who is ordained the grace of sanctification, fitting and
qualifying him for the proper discharge of his functions and for the administration of the Sacraments, in the
same way as by the grace of Baptism each one is qualified to receive the other Sacraments.

Another grace is clearly conferred by this Sacrament; namely, a special power with reference to the most
Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist. This power is full and perfect in the priest, because he alone can consecrate
the body and blood of our Lord; but it is greater or less in the inferior ministers in proportion as their ministry
approaches the Sacrament of the Altar.

This power is also called a spiritual character, because those who have been ordained are distinguished from the
rest of the faithful by a certain interior mark impressed on the soul, by which they are dedicated to the divine
worship. It is this grace which the Apostle seems to have had in view when he said to Timothy: Neglect not the
grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of hands of the priesthood; and again: I
admonish thee, that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.




Admonition

This much will suffice for the Sacrament of Orders. We have aimed at presenting nothing more than the
principal points that bear on the subject, so as to supply the pastor with sufficient matter for instructing the
faithful, and directing them to Christian piety.




                                     THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY




Importance Of Instruction On This Sacrament

As it is the duty of the pastor to seek the holiness and perfection of the faithful, his earnest desires must be in
full accordance with those expressed by the Apostle when writing to the Corinthians: I would that all men were
even as myself, that is, that all should embrace the virtue of continence. No greater happiness can befall the
faithful in this life than to have their souls distracted by no worldly cares, the unruly desires of the flesh
tranquillised and restrained, and the mind fixed on the practice of piety and the contemplation of heavenly
things.

But as, according to the same Apostle, every one hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and
another after that; and as marriage is gifted with great and divine blessings, so much so as truly and properly to
hold a place among the other Sacraments of the Catholic Church, and as its celebration was honoured by the
presence of our Lord Himself, it is clear that this subject should be explained, particularly since we find that St.
Paul and the Prince of the Apostles have in many places minutely described to us not only the dignity but also
the duties of the married state. Filled with the Spirit of God (these Apostles) well understood the numerous and
important advantages which must flow to Christian society from a knowledge, and an inviolable observance by
the faithful of the sanctity of marriage; while they saw that from ignorance or disregard of (its holiness), many
and serious calamities and losses must be brought upon the Church.




Nature and Meaning of Marriage



                                                        208
The nature and meaning of marriage are, therefore, to be first explained. Vice not infrequently assumes the
semblance of virtue, and hence care must be taken that the faithful be not deceived by a false appearance of
marriage, and thus stain their souls with turpitude and wicked lusts. To explain this subject, let us begin with the
meaning of the word itself.




Names Of This Sacrament

The word matrimony is derived from the fact that the principal object which a female should propose to herself
in marriage is to become a mother; or from the fact that to a mother it belongs to conceive, bring forth and train
her offspring.

It is also called wedlock (conjugium) from joining together, because a lawful wife is united to her husband, as it
were, by a common yoke.

It is called nuptials, because, as St. Ambrose observes, the bride veiled her face through modesty -- a custom
which would also seem to imply that she was to be subject and obedient to her husband.




Definition Of Matrimony

Matrimony, according to the general opinion of theologians, is defined: The conjugal union of man and woman,
contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life.

In order that the different parts of this definition may be better understood, it should be taught that, although a
perfect marriage has all the following conditions, -- namely, internal consent, external compact expressed by
words, the obligation and tie which arise from the contract, and the marriage debt by which it is consummated;
yet the obligation and tie expressed by the word union alone have the force and nature of marriage.

The special character of this union is marked by the word conjugal. This word is added because other contracts,
by which men and women bind themselves to help each other in consideration of money received or other
reason, differ essentially from matrimony.

Next follow the words between qualified persons; for persons excluded by law cannot contract marriage, and if
they do their marriage is invalid. Persons, for instance, within the fourth degree of kindred, a boy before his
fourteenth year, and a female before her twelfth, the ages established by law, cannot contract marriage.

The words, which obliges them to live together throughout life, express the indissolubility of the tie which binds
husband and wife.




Essence And Cause Of Marriage

Hence it is evident that marriage consists in the tie spoken of above. Some eminent theologians, it is true, say
that it consists in the consent, as when they define it: The consent of the man and woman. But we are to
understand them to mean that the consent is the efficient cause of marriage, which is the doctrine of the Fathers
of the Council of Florence; because, without the consent and contract, the obligation and tie cannot possibly
exist.




                                                        209
The Kind of Consent Required in Matrimony

It is most necessary that the consent be expressed in words denoting present time.




Mutual

Marriage is not a mere donation, but a mutual agreement; and therefore the consent of one of the parties is
insufficient for marriage, the consent of both being essential.




External

To declare this consent words are obviously necessary. If the internal consent alone, without any external
indication, were sufficient for marriage, it would then seem to follow as a necessary consequence, that were two
persons, living in the most separate and distant countries, to consent to marry, they would contract a true and
indissoluble marriage, even before they had mutually signified to each other their consent by letter or messenger
-- a consequence as repugnant to reason as it is opposed to the decrees and established usage of holy Church.




Present

Rightly was it said that the consent must be expressed in words which have reference to present time; for words
which signify a future time, promise, but do not actually unite in marriage. Besides, it is evident that what is to
be done has no present existence, and what has no present existence can have little or no firmness or stability.
Hence a man who has only promised to marry a certain woman acquires by the promise no marriage rights,
since his promise has not yet been fulfilled. Such promises are, it is true, obligatory, and their violation involves
the offending party in a breach of faith. But he who has once entered into the matrimonial alliance, regret it as
he afterwards may, cannot possibly change, or invalidate, or undo what has been done.

As, then, the marriage contract is not a mere promise, but a transfer of right, by which the man actually yields
the dominion of his body to the woman, the woman the dominion of her body to the man, it must therefore be
made in words which designate the present time, the force of which words abides with undiminished efficacy
from the moment of their utterance, and binds the husband and wife by a tie that cannot be broken.

Instead of words, however, it may be sufficient for marriage to substitute a nod or other unequivocal sign of
internal consent. Even silence, when the result of female modesty, may be sufficient, provided the parents
answer for their daughter.




The Essence of Marriage Constituted by the Consent

Hence pastors should teach the faithful that the nature and force of marriage consists in the tie and obligation;
and that, without consummation, the consent of the parties, expressed in the manner already explained, is
sufficient to constitute a true marriage. It is certain that our first parents before their fall, when, according to the




                                                          210
holy Fathers, no consummation took place, were really united in marriage. Hence the Fathers say that marriage
consists not in its use but in the consent. This doctrine is repeated by St. Ambrose in his book On Virgins.




Twofold Consideration of Marriage

When these matters have been explained, it should be taught that matrimony is to be considered from two points
of view, either as a natural union, since it was not invented by man but instituted by nature; or as a Sacrament,
the efficacy of which transcends the order of nature.




Marriage As A Natural Contract

As grace perfects nature, and as that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that
which is spiritual, the order of our matter requires that we first treat of Matrimony as a natural contract,
imposing natural duties, and next consider what pertains to it as a Sacrament.




Instituted By God

The faithful, therefore, are to be taught in the first place that marriage was instituted by God. We read in
Genesis that God created them male and female, and blessed them, saying: "Increase and multiply"; and also:
"It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.,' And a little further on: But for
Adam there was not found a helper like himself. Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam; and when he
was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it. And the Lord God built a rib which he took
from Adam. into a woman, and brought her to Adam; and Adam said: "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh
of my flesh: she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man: wherefore a man shall leave father
and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall be two in one flesh," These words, according to the
authority of our Lord Himself, as we read in St. Matthew, prove the divine institution. of Matrimony.




Marriage Is Indissoluble By Divine Law

Not only did God institute marriage; He also, as the Council of Trent declares, rendered it perpetual and
indissoluble.' What God hath joined together, says our Lord, let not man separate.

Although it belongs to marriage as a natural contract to be indissoluble, yet its indissolubility arises principally
from its nature as a Sacrament, as it is the sacramental character that, in all its natural relations, elevates
marriage to the highest perfection. In any event, dissolubility is at once opposed to the proper education of
children, and to the other advantages of marriage.




Marriage Not Obligatory On All

The words increase and multiply, which were uttered by the Lord, do not impose on every individual an
obligation to marry, but only declare the purpose of the institution of marriage. Now that the human race is
widely diffused, not only is there no law rendering marriage obligatory, but, on the contrary, virginity is highly



                                                        211
exalted and strongly recommended in Scripture as superior to marriage, and as a state of greater perfection and
holiness. For our Lord and Saviour taught as follows: He that can take it, let him take it; and the Apostle says:
Concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord; but I give counsel as having obtained mercy from
the Lord to be faithful.




The Motives And Ends Of Marriage

We have now to explain why man and woman should be joined in marriage. First of all, nature itself by an
instinct implanted in both sexes impels them to such companionship, and this is further encouraged by the hope
of mutual assistance in bearing more easily the discomforts of life and the infirmities of old age.

A second reason for marriage is the desire of family, not so much, however, with a view to leave after us heirs
to inherit our property and fortune, as to bring up children in the true faith and in the service of God. That such
was the principal object of the holy Patriarchs when they married is clear from Scripture. Hence the Angel,
when informing Tobias of the means of repelling the violent assaults of the evil demon, says: I will show thee
who they are over whom the devil can prevail; for they who in such manner receive matrimony as to shut out
God from themselves and from their mind, and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule which
have not understanding, over them the devil hath power. He then adds: Thou shalt take the virgin with the fear
of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that in the seed of Abraham thou mayest obtain a
blessing in children. It was also for this reason that God instituted marriage from the beginning; and therefore
married persons who, to prevent conception or procure abortion, have recourse to medicine, are guilty of a most
heinous crime -- nothing less than wicked conspiracy to commit murder.

A third reason has been added, as a consequence of the fall of our first parents. On account of the loss of
original innocence the passions began to rise in rebellion against right reason; and man, conscious of his own
frailty and unwilling to fight the battles of the flesh, is supplied by marriage with an antidote by which to avoid
sins of lust. For fear of fornication, says the Apostle, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman
have her own husband; and a little after, having recommended to married persons a temporary abstinence from
the marriage debt, to give themselves to prayer, he adds: Return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your
incontinency.

These are ends, some one of which, those who desire to contract marriage piously and religiously, as becomes
the children of the Saints, should propose to themselves. If to these we add other causes which induce to
contract marriage, and, in choosing a wife, to prefer one person to another, such as the desire of leaving an heir,
wealth, beauty, illustrious descent, congeniality of disposition -- such motives, because not inconsistent with the
holiness of marriage, are not to be condemned. We do not find that the Sacred Scriptures condemn the Patriarch
Jacob for having chosen Rachel for her beauty, in preference to Lia.

So much should be explained regarding Matrimony as a natural contract.




Marriage Considered as a Sacrament

It will now be necessary to explain that Matrimony is far superior in its sacramental aspect and aims at an
incomparably higher end. For as marriage, as a natural union, was instituted from the beginning to propagate the
human race; so was the sacramental dignity subsequently conferred upon it in order that a people might be
begotten and brought up for the service and worship of the true God and of Christ our Saviour.

Thus when Christ our Lord wished to give a sign of the intimate union that exists between Him and His Church
and of His immense love for us, He chose especially the sacred union of man and wife. That this sign was a



                                                        212
most appropriate one will readily appear from the fact that of all human relations there is none that binds so
closely as the marriage-tie, and from the fact that husband and wife are bound to one another by the bonds of
the greatest affection and love. Hence it is that Holy Writ so frequently represents to us the divine union of
Christ and the Church under the figure of marriage.




Marriage Is A Sacrament

That Matrimony is a Sacrament the Church, following the authority of the Apostle, has always held to be certain
and incontestable. In his Epistle to the Ephesians he writes: Men should love their wives as their own bodies.
He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it,
as also Christ doth the church; for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause
shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall adhere to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. This is a
great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church. Now his expression, this is a great sacrament,
undoubtedly refers to Matrimony, and must be taken to mean that the union of man and wife, which has God for
its Author, is a Sacrament, that is, a sacred sign of that most holy union that binds Christ our Lord to His
Church.

That this is the true and proper meaning of the Apostle's words is shown by the ancient holy Fathers who have
interpreted them, and by the explanation furnished by the Council of Trent. It is indubitable, therefore, that the
Apostle compares the husband to Christ, and the wife to the Church; that the husband is head of the wife as
Christ is the head of the Church; and that for this very reason the husband should love his wife and the wife love
and respect her husband. For Christ loved his church, and gave himself for her; while as the same Apostle
teaches, the church is subject to Christ.

That grace is also signified and conferred by this Sacrament, which are two properties that constitute the
principal characteristics of each Sacrament, is declared by the Council as follows: By his passion Christ, the
Author and Perfecter of the venerable Sacraments, merited for us the grace that perfects the natural love (of
husband and wife), confirms their indissoluble union, and sanctifies them. It should, therefore, be shown that by
the grace of this Sacrament husband and wife are joined in the bonds of mutual love, cherish affection one
towards the other, avoid illicit attachments and passions, and so keep their marriage honourable in all things, . . .
and their bed undefiled.




Marriage before Christ




It Was Not A Sacrament

How much the Sacrament of Matrimony is superior to the marriages made both previous to and under the
(Mosaic) Law may be judged from the fact that though the Gentiles themselves were convinced there was
something divine in marriage, and for that reason regarded promiscuous intercourse as contrary to the law of
nature, while they also considered fornication, adultery and other kinds of impurity to be punishable offences;
yet their marriages never had any sacramental value.

Among the Jews the laws of marriage were observed far more religiously, and it cannot be doubted that their
unions were endowed with more holiness. As they had received from God the promise that in the seed of
Abraham all nations should be blessed," it was justly considered by them to be a very pious duty to bring forth
children, and thus contribute to the propagation of the chosen people from whom Christ the Lord and Saviour
was to derive His birth in His human nature. Still their unions also fell short of the real nature of a Sacrament.



                                                        213
Before Christ Marriage Had Fallen From Its Primitive Unity And Indissolubility

It should be added that if we consider the law of nature after the fall and the Law of Moses we shall easily see
that-marriage had fallen from its original honour and purity. Thus under the law of nature we read of many of
the ancient Patriarchs that they had several wives at the same time; while under the Law of Moses it was
permissible, should cause exist, to repudiate one's wife by giving her a bill of divorce. Both these (concessions)
have been suppressed by the law of the Gospel, and marriage has been restored to its original state.




Christ Restored to Marriage its Primitive Qualities




Unity Of Marriage

Though some of the ancient Patriarchs are not to be blamed for having married several wives, since they did not
act thus without divine dispensation, yet Christ our Lord has clearly shown that polygamy is not in keeping with
the nature of Matrimony. These are His words: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh; and He adds: wherefore they are no more two but one
flesh. In these words He makes it clear that God instituted marriage to be the union of two, and only two
persons. The same truth He has taught very distinctly in another passage, wherein He says: Whosoever shall put
away his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her; and if the wife shall put away her husband,
and be married to another, she committeth adultery. For if it were lawful for a man to have several wives, there
is no reason why he who takes to himself a second wife, along with the wife he already has, should be regarded
as more guilty of adultery than if he had dismissed his first wife and taken a second.

Hence it is that when an infidel who, following the customs of his country has married several wives, happens
to be converted to the true religion, the Church orders him to dismiss all but the first, and regard her alone as his
true and lawful wife.




Indissolubility Of Marriage

The self-same testimony of Christ our Lord easily proves that the marriage-tie cannot be broken by any sort of
divorce. For if by a bill of divorce a woman were freed from the law that binds her to her husband, she might
marry another husband without being in the least guilty of adultery. Yet our Lord says clearly: Whosoever shall
put away his wife and shall marry another committeth adultery. Hence it is plain that the bond of marriage can
be dissolved by death alone, as is confirmed by the Apostle when he says: A woman is bound by the law as long
as her husband liveth; but if her husband die she is at liberty; let her marry whom she will, only in the Lord; and
again: To them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband; and
if she depart that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. To the wife, then, who for a just cause
has left her husband, the Apostle offers this alternative: Let her either remain unmarried or be reconciled to her
husband. Nor does holy Church permit husband and wife to separate without weighty reasons.




Advantages Of Indissolubility




                                                        214
Lest, however, the law of Matrimony should seem too severe on account of its absolute indissolubility, the
advantages of this indissolubility should be pointed out.

The first (beneficial consequence) is that men are given to understand that in entering Matrimony virtue and
congeniality of disposition are to be preferred to wealth or beauty -- a circumstance that cannot but prove of the
very highest advantage to the interests of society at large.

In the second place, if marriage could be dissolved by divorce, married persons would hardly ever be without
causes of disunion, which would be daily supplied by the old enemy of peace and purity; while, on the contrary,
now that the faithful must remember that even though separated as to bed and board, they remain none the less
bound by the bond of marriage with no hope of marrying another, they are by this very fact rendered less prone
to strife and discord. And even if it sometimes happens that husband and wife become separated, and are unable
to bear the want of their partnership any longer, they are easily reconciled by friends and return to their common
life.

The pastor should not here omit the salutary admonition of St. Augustine who, to convince the faithful that they
should not consider it a hardship to receive back the wife they have put away for adultery, provided she repents
of her crime, observes: Why should not the Christian husband receive back his wife when the Church receives
her? And why should not the wife pardon her adulterous but penitent husband when Christ has already
pardoned him? True it is that Scripture calls him foolish who keepeth an adulteress ; but the meaning refers to
her who refuses to repent of her crime and quit the disgraceful course she has entered on.

From all this it will be clear that Christian marriage is far superior in dignity and perfection to that of Gentiles
and Jews.




The Three Blessings of Marriage

The faithful should also be shown that there are three blessings of marriage: children, fidelity and the
Sacrament. These are blessings which to some degree compensate for the inconveniences referred to by the
Apostle in the words: Such shall have tribulation of the flesh, and they lead to this other result that sexual
intercourse, which is sinful outside of marriage, is rendered right and honourable.




Offspring

The first blessing, then, is a family, that is to say, children born of a true and lawful wife. So highly did the
Apostle esteem this blessing that he says: The woman shall be saved by bearing children.' These words are to be
understood not only of bearing children, but also of bringing them up and training them to the practice of piety;
for the Apostle immediately subjoins: If she continue in faith. Scripture says: Hast thou children? Instruct them
and bow down their necks from childhood. The same is taught by the Apostle; while Tobias, Job and other holy
Patriarchs in Sacred Scripture furnish us with beautiful examples of such training. The duties of both parents
and children will, however, be set forth in detail when we come to speak of the fourth Commandment.




Fidelity

The second advantage of marriage is faith, not indeed that virtue which we receive in Baptism; but the fidelity
which binds wife to husband and husband to wife in such a way that they mutually deliver to each other power
over their bodies, promising at the same time never to violate the holy bond of Matrimony. This is easily



                                                         215
inferred from the words pronounced by Adam when taking Eve as his wife, and which were afterwards
confirmed by Christ our Lord in the Gospel: Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to
his wife and they shall be two in one flesh. It is also inferred from the words of the Apostle: The wife hath not
power of her own body, but the husband: and in like manner, the husband hath not power of his own body but
the wife. Justly, then, did the Lord in the Old Law ordain the most severe penalties against adulterers who
violated this conjugal fidelity.

Matrimonial fidelity also demands that they love one another with a special, holy and pure love; not as
adulterers love one another but as Christ loves His Church. This is the rule laid down by the Apostle when he
says: Husbands, love your wives as Christ also loved the church. And surely (Christ's) love for His Church was
immense; it was a love inspired not by His own advantage, but only by the advantage of His spouse.




Sacrament

The third advantage is called the Sacrament, that is to say, the indissoluble bond of marriage. As the Apostle has
it: The Lord commanded that the wife depart not from the husband, and if she depart that she remain unmarried
or be reconciled to' her husband; and let not the husband put away his wife. And truly, if marriage as a
Sacrament represents the union of Christ with His Church, it also necessarily follows that just as Christ never
separates Himself from His Church, so in like manner the wife can never be separated from her husband in so
far as regards the marriage-tie.




The Duties of Married People

The more easily to preserve the holy state (of marriage) from dissensions, the duties of husband and wife as
inculcated by St. Paul and by the Prince of the Apostles must be explained.




Duties Of A Husband

It is the duty of the husband to treat his wife generously and honourably. It should not be forgotten that Eve was
called by Adam his companion. The woman, he says, whom thou gavest me as a companion. Hence it was,
according to the opinion of some of the holy Fathers, that she was formed not from the feet but from the side of
man; as, on the other hand, she was not formed from his head, in order to give her to understand that it was not
hers to command but to obey her husband.

The husband should also be constantly occupied in some honest pursuit with a view to provide necessaries for
the support of his family and to avoid idleness, the root of almost every vice.

He is also to keep all his family in order, to correct their morals, and see that they faithfully discharge their
duties.




Duties Of A Wife

On the other hand, the duties of a wife are thus summed up by the Prince of the Apostles: Let wives be subject
to their husbands. that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word by the conversation of the
wives, considering your chaste conversation with fear. Let not their adorning be the outward plaiting of the hair,


                                                         216
or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel: but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a
quiet and meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. For after this manner heretofore the holy women also,
who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham,
calling hint lord.

To train their children in the practice of virtue and to pay particular attention to their domestic concerns should
also be especial objects of their attention. The wife should love to remain at home, unless compelled by
necessity to go out; and she should never presume to leave home without her husband's consent.

Again, and in this the conjugal union chiefly consists, let wives never forget that next to God they are to love
their husbands, to esteem them above all others, yielding to them in all things not inconsistent with Christian
piety, a willing and ready obedience.




The Law of the Church on Marriage




The Rite To Be Observed

Having explained these matters, pastors should next teach what rites are to be observed in contracting marriage.
There is no need, however, that we dwell on these questions here. The Council of Trent has laid down fully and
accurately what must be chiefly observed; and this decree will not be unknown to pastors. It will suffice, then,
to admonish them-to study to make themselves acquainted, from the doctrine of the Council, with what regards
this subject, and to explain it carefully to the faithful.

But above all, lest young persons, whose period of life is marked by extreme indiscretion, should be deceived
by a merely nominal marriage and foolishly rush into sinful love-unions, the pastor cannot too frequently
remind them that there can be no true and valid marriage unless it be contracted in the presence of the parish
priest, or of some other priest commissioned by him, or by the Ordinary, and that of a certain number of
witnesses.




The Impediments Of Marriage

The impediments of marriage are also to be explained, a subject so minutely and accurately treated by many
grave and learned writers on the virtues and vices as to render it an easy task to draw upon their labours,
particularly as the pastor has occasion to have such works continually in his hands. The instructions, therefore,
which such books contain, and also the decrees of the Council with regard to the impediments arising from
spiritual relationship, from public honesty, and from fornication, the pastor should peruse with attention and
expound with care.




The Recipient of Matrimony




Dispositions With Which The Sacrament Is To Be Approached




                                                        217
From the above may be learned the dispositions with which the faithful should contract matrimony. They
should consider that they are about to enter upon a work that is not human but divine. The example of the
Fathers of the Old Law, who esteemed marriage as a most holy and religious rite, although it had not then been
raised to the dignity of a Sacrament, shows the singular purity of soul and piety (with which Christians should
approach marriage).




Consent Of Parents

Among other things, children should be exhorted earnestly that they owe as a tribute of respect to their parents,
or to those under whose guardianship and authority they are placed, not to contract marriage without their
knowledge, still less in defiance of their express wishes. It should be observed that in the Old Law children
were always given in marriage by their fathers; and that the will of the parent is always to have very great
influence on the choice of the child, is clear from these words of the Apostle He that giveth his virgin in
marriage doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.




The Use Of Marriage

Finally, the use of marriage is a subject which pastors should so treat as to avoid any expression that may be
unfit to meet the ears of the faithful, that may be calculated to offend the piety of some, or excite the laughter
of. others. The words of the Lord are chaste words; and the teacher of a Christian people should make use of the
same kind of language, one that is characterised by singular gravity and purity of soul. Two lessons of
instruction to the faithful are, then, to be specially insisted upon.

The first is that marriage is not to be used for purposes of lust or sensuality, but that its use is to be restrained
within those limits which, as we have already shown, have been fixed by the Lord. It should be remembered
that the Apostle admonishes: They that have wives, let them be as though they had them not, and that St.
Jerome says: The love which a wise man cherishes towards his wife is the result of judgment, not the impulse of
passion; he governs the impetuosity of desire, and is not hurried into indulgence. There is nothing more
shameful than that a husband should love his wife as an adulteress.

But as every blessing is to be obtained from God by holy prayer, the faithful are also to be taught sometimes to
abstain from the marriage debt, in order to devote themselves to prayer. Let the faithful understand that (this
religious continence), according to the proper and holy injunction of our predecessors, is particularly to be
observed for at least three days before Communion, and oftener during the solemn fast of Lent.

Thus will they find the blessings of marriage to be daily increased by an abundance of divine grace; and living
in the pursuit of piety, they will not only spend this life in peace and tranquillity, but will also repose in the true
and firm hope, which confoundeth not, of arriving, through the divine goodness, at the possession of that life
which is eternal.




                                      PART III : THE DECALOGUE



Importance Of Instruction On The Commandments




                                                         218
St. Augustine in his writings remarks that the Decalogue is the summary and epitome of all laws: Although the
Lord had spoken many things, He gave to Moses only two stone tablets, called "tables of testimony," to be
placed in the Ark. For if carefully examined and well understood, whatever else is commanded by God will be
found to depend on the Ten Commandments which were engraved on those two tables, just as these Ten
Commandments, in turn, are reducible to two, the love of God and of our neighbour, on which "depend the
whole law and the prophets."

Since, then, the Decalogue is a summary of the whole Law, the pastor should give his days and nights to its
consideration, that he may be able not only to regulate his own life by its precepts, but also to instruct in the law
of God the people committed to his care. The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the
law at his mouth, because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts. To the priests of the New Law this injunction
applies in a special manner; they are nearer to God, and should be transformed from glory to glory, as by the
Spirit of the Lord. Since Christ our Lord has called them light, it is their special duty to be a light to them that
are in darkness, the instructors of the foolish, the teachers of infants; and if a man be overtaken in any fault, they
who are spiritual should instruct such a one.

In the tribunal of penance the priest holds the place of a judge, and pronounces sentence according to the nature
and gravity of the offence. Unless, therefore, he is desirous that his ignorance should prove an injury to himself
and to others, he must bring with him to the discharge of this duty the greatest vigilance and the most practiced
acquaintance with the interpretation of the law, in order to be able to pronounce, according to this divine rule,
on every act and omission; and, as the Apostle says, to teach sound doctrine, free from error, and heal the
diseases of the soul, which are sins, in order that the people may be acceptable to God, pursuers of good works.




Motives for Observing the Commandments

In these instructions the pastor should propose to himself and to others motives for keeping the Commandments




God Is The Giver Of The Commandments

Now among all the motives which induce men to obey this law the strongest is that God is its author. True, it is
said to have been delivered by angels, but no one can doubt that its author is God. This is most clear not only
from the words of the Legislator Himself, which we shall shortly explain, but also from innumerable other
passages of Scripture that will readily occur to pastors.

Who is not conscious that a law is inscribed on his heart by God, teaching him to distinguish good from evil,
vice from virtue, justice from injustice? The force and import of this unwritten law do not conflict with that
which is written. Who is there, then, who will dare to deny that God is the author of the written, as He is of the
unwritten law ?

But, lest the people, aware of the abrogation of the Mosaic Law, may imagine that the precepts of the
Decalogue are no longer obligatory, it should be taught that when God gave the Law to Moses, He did not so
much establish a new code, as render more luminous that divine light b which the depraved morals and long-
continued perversity of man had at that time almost obscured. It is most certain that we are not bound to obey
the Commandments because they were delivered by Moses, but because they are implanted in the hearts of all,
and have been explained and confirmed by Christ our Lord.

The reflection that God is the author of the law is highly useful, and exercises great influence in persuading (to
its observance); for we cannot doubt His wisdom and justice, nor can we escape His infinite power and might.




                                                        219
Hence, when by His Prophets He commands the law to be observed, He proclaims that He is the Lord God; and
the Decalogue itself opens: I am the Lord thy God; and elsewhere (we read): If I am a master, where is my fear?

That God has deigned to make clear to us His holy will on which depends our eternal salvation (is a
consideration) which, besides animating the faithful to the observance of His Commandments, must call forth
their gratitude Hence Scripture, in more passages than one, recalling this great blessing, admonishes the people
to recognise their own dignity and the bounty of the Lord Thus in Deuteronomy it is said: This is your wisdom
and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts they may say: Behold a wise and
understanding people, a great nation; again, in the Psalm (we read): He hath not done in like manner to every
nation, and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.




The Commandments Were Proclaimed With Great Solemnity

If the pastor explain the circumstances which accompanied the promulgation of the Law, as recorded in
Scripture, the faithful will easily understand with what piety and humility they should receive and reverence the
Law received from God.

All were commanded by God that for three days before the promulgation of the Law they should wash their
garments and abstain from conjugal intercourse, in order that they might be more holy and better prepared to
receive the Law, and that on the third day they should be in readiness When they had reached the mountain
from which the Lord was to deliver the Law by Moses, Moses alone was commanded to ascend the mountain.
Thither came God with great majesty, filling the place with thunder and lightning, with fire and dense clouds,
and began to speak to Moses, and delivered to him the Commandments

In this the divine wisdom had solely for object to admonish us that the law of the Lord should be received with
pure and humble minds, and that over the neglect of His commands impend the heaviest chastisements of the
divine justice.




The Observance Of The Commandments Is Not Difficult

The pastor should also teach that the Commandments of God are not difficult, as these words of St Augustine
are alone sufficient to show: How, I ask, is it said to be impossible for man to love -- to love, I say, a beneficent
Creator, a most loving Father, and also, in the persons of his , brethren to love his own flesh? Yet, "he who
loveth has fulfilled the law." Hence the Apostle St. John expressly says that the commandments of God are not
heavy; for as St. Bernard observes, nothing more just could be exacted from man, nothing that could confer on
him a more exalted dignity, nothing more advantageous. Hence St. Augustine, filled with admiration of God's
infinite goodness, thus addresses God : What is man that Thou wouldst be loved by him ? And if he loves Thee
not, Thou threatenest t him with heavy punishment. Is it not punishment enough that I love Thee not ?

But should anyone plead human infirmity to excuse himself for not loving God, it should be explained that He
who demands our love pours into our hearts by the Holy Ghost the fervour of His love; and this good Spirit our
heavenly Father gives to those that ask him with reason, therefore, did St. Augustine pray: Give what thou
commandest and command what thou pleasest. As, then, God is ever ready to help us, especially since the death
of Christ the Lord, by which the prince of this world was cast out, there is no reason why anyone should be
disheartened by the difficulty of the undertaking. To him who loves, nothing is difficult.




The Observance Of The Commandments Is Necessary



                                                        220
Furthermore, it will contribute much to persuade (obedience to the law) if it is explained that such obedience is
necessary, especially since in these our days there are not wanting those who, to their own serious injury, have
the impious hardihood to assert that the observance of the law, whether easy or difficult, is by no means
necessary to salvation.

This wicked and impious error the pastor should refute from Scripture, especially from the same Apostle by
whose authority they attempt to defend their wickedness. What, then, are the words of the Apostle?
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Again,
inculcating the same doctrine, he says: , new creature, in Christ, alone avails. By a new creature in Christ he
evidently means him who observes the Commandments of God; for, he who observes the Commandments of
God loves God, as our Lord Himself testifies in St. John: If anyone love me, he will keep my word.

A man, it is true, may be justified, and from wicked may become righteous, before he has fulfilled, by external
acts, each of the Commandments; but no one who has arrived at the use of reason can be justified, unless he is
resolved to keep all of God's Commandments.




The Observance Of The Commandments Is Attended By Many Blessings

Finally, to leave nothing unsaid that may be calculated to induce the faithful to an observance of the law, the
pastor should point out how abundant and sweet are its fruits. This he will easily accomplish by referring to the
eighteenth Psalm, which celebrates the praises of the divine law. The highest eulogy of the law is that it
proclaims the glory and the majesty of God more eloquently than even the heavenly bodies, whose beauty and
order excite the admiration of all peoples, even the most uncivilised, and compel them to acknowledge the
glory, wisdom and power of the Creator and Architect of the universe.

The law of the Lord also converts souls to God; for knowing the ways of God and His holy will through the
medium of His law, we turn our steps into the ways of the Lord.

It also gives wisdom to little ones; for they alone who fear God are truly wise. Hence, the observers of the law
of God are filled with pure delights, with knowledge of divine mysteries, and are blessed with plenteous joys
and rewards both in this life and in the life to come.

In our observance of the law, however, we should not act so much for our own advantage as for the sake of God
who, by means of the law, has revealed His will to man. If other creatures are obedient to God's will, how much
more reasonable that man should follow it?




God's Goodness Invites Us To Keep His Commandments

Nor should it be omitted that God has preeminently displayed His clemency and the riches of His goodness in
this, that while He might have forced us to serve His glory without a reward, He has, notwithstanding, deigned
to identify His own glory with our advantage, thus rendering what tends to His honour, conducive to our
interests.

This is a great and striking consideration; and the pastor, therefore, should teach in the concluding words of the
Prophet that in keeping them there is a great reward. Not only are we promised those blessings which seem to
have reference to earthly happiness, such, for example, as to be blessed in the city, and blessed in the field: but
we are also promised a great reward in heaven, good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over,
which, aided by the divine mercy, we merit by our holy and pious actions.




                                                       221
The Promulgation of the Law

I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt not
have strange gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing. The Law, although delivered to the
Jews by the Lord from the mountain, was long before written and impressed by nature on the heart of man, and
was therefore rendered obligatory by God for all men and all times.




The People To Whom The Law Was Given

It will be very useful, however, to explain carefully the words in which it was proclaimed to the Hebrews by
Moses, its minister and interpreter, and also the history of the Israelites, which is so full of mysteries.




Epitome Of Jewish History

(The pastor) should first tell that from among the nations of the earth God chose one which descended from
Abraham; that it was the divine will that Abraham should be a stranger in the land of Canaan, the possession of
which He had promised him; and that, although for more than four hundred years he and his posterity were
wanderers before they dwelt in the promised land, God never withdrew from them, throughout their
wanderings, His protecting care. They passed from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people;
He suffered no man to hurt them, and He even reproved kings for their sakes.

Before they went down into Egypt He sent before them one by whose prudence they and the Egyptians were
rescued from famine. In Egypt such was His kindness towards them that although opposed by the power of
Pharaoh who sought their destruction, they increased to an extraordinary degree; and when they were severely
harassed and cruelly treated as slaves, God raised up Moses as a leader to lead them out in a strong hand. It is
especially this deliverance that the Lord refers to in the opening words of the Law: I am the Lord thy God who
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.




Lessons To Be Drawn From Jewish History

From all this the pastor should especially note that out of all the nations God chose only one whom He called
His people, and by whom He willed to be known and worshipped; not that they were superior to other nations in
justice or in numbers, and of this God Himself reminds the Hebrews, but rather because He wished, by the
multiplication and aggrandisement of an inconsiderable and impoverished nation, to display to mankind His
power and goodness.

Such having been their condition, he was closely united to them, and loved them, and Lord of heaven and earth
as He was, He disdained not to be called their God. He desired that the other nations might thus be excited to
emulation and that mankind, seeing the happiness of the Israelites, might embrace the worship of the true God.
In the same way St. Paul says that by discussing the happiness of the Gentiles and their knowledge of the true
God, he provoked to emulation those who were his own flesh.

The faithful should next be taught that God suffered the Hebrew Patriarchs to wander for so long a time, and
their posterity to be oppressed and harassed by a galling servitude, in order to teach us that none are friends of
God except those who are enemies of the world and pilgrims on earth, and that an entire detachment from the


                                                        222
world gives us an easier access to the friendship of God. Further He wished that, being brought to His service,
we should understand how much happier are they who serve God, than they who serve the world. Of this
Scripture itself admonishes us: Yet they shall serve him, that they may know the difference between my service
and the service of the kingdom of the earth.

(The pastor) should also explain that God delayed the fulfilment of His promise until after the lapse of more
than four hundred years, in order that His people might be sustained by faith and hope; for, as we shall show
when we come to explain the first Commandment, God wishes His children to depend on Him at all times and
to repose all their confidence in His goodness.




The Time And Place In Which The Law Was Promulgated

Finally, the time and place, in which the people of Israel received this Law from God should be noted. They
received it after they had been delivered from Egypt and had come into the wilderness; in order that, impressed
by the memory of a recent benefit and awed by the dreariness of the place in which they journeyed, they might
be the better disposed to receive the Law. For man becomes closely attached to those whose bounty he has
experienced, and when he has lost all hope of assistance from his fellow-man, he then seeks refuge in the
protection of God.

From all this we learn that the more detached the faithful are from the allurements of the world and the
pleasures of sense, the more disposed they are to accept heavenly doctrines. As the Prophet has written: Whom
shall he teach knowledge, and whom shall he make to understand the hearing? Them that are weaned from the
milk, that are drawn away from the breasts.




THE FIRST COMMANDMENT : "I am the lord thy god, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out
of the house of bondage. Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself
a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of
those things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them. I am
the lord thy god, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and
fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
keep my commandments."




"I am the Lord thy God"

The pastor should use his best endeavours to induce the faithful to keep continually in view these words: I am
the Lord thy God. From them they will learn that their Lawgiver is none other than their Creator, by whom they
were made and are preserved, and that they may truly repeat: He is the Lord our God, and we are the people of
his pasture and the sheep of his hand. The frequent and earnest inculcation of these words will also serve to
induce the faithful more readily to observe the Law and avoid sin.




"Who Brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage"

The next words, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, seem to relate solely to
the Jews liberated from the bondage of Egypt. But if we consider the meaning of the salvation of the entire
human race, those words are still more applicable to Christians, who are liberated by God not from the bondage



                                                      223
of Egypt, but from the slavery of sin and the powers of darkness, and are translated into the kingdom of his
beloved Son. Contemplating the greatness of this favour, Jeremias foretold: Behold the days come, saith the
Lord, when it shall be said no more: The Lord liveth that brought forth. the children of Israel out of the land of
Egypt; but: The Lord liveth that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the
lands to which I cast them out; and I will bring them again into their land which gave to their fathers. Behold, I
send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them, etc. And, indeed, our most indulgent Father has
gathered together, through His beloved Son, His children that were dispersed, that being made free from sin and
made the servants of justice, we may serve before him in holiness and justice all our days.'

Against every temptation, therefore, the faithful should arm themselves with these words of the Apostle as with
a shield: Shall we who are dead to sin live any longer therein? We are no longer our own, we are His who died
and rose again for us. He is the Lord our God who has purchased us for Himself at the price of His blood. Shall
we then be any longer capable of sinning against the Lord our God, and crucifying Him again? Being made
truly free, and with that liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, let us, as we heretofore yielded our members
to serve injustice, henceforward yield them to serve justice to sanctification.




"Thou shalt not have Strange Gods before Me"

The pastor should teach that the first part of the Decalogue contains our duties towards God; the second part,
our duties towards our neighbour. The reason (for this order) is that the services we render our neighbour are
rendered for the sake of God; for then only do we love our neighbour as God commands when we love him for
God's sake. The Commandments which regard God are those which were inscribed on the first table of the Law.




The Above Words Contain A Command And A Prohibition

(The pastor) should next show that the words just quoted contain a twofold precept, the one mandatory, the
other prohibitory. When it is said: Thou shalt not have strange gods before me, it is equivalent to saying: Thou
shalt worship me the true God; thou shalt not worship strange gods.




What They Command

The (mandatory part) contains a precept of faith, hope and charity. For, acknowledging God to be immovable,
immutable, always the same, we rightly confess that He is faithful and entirely just. Hence in assenting to His
oracles, we necessarily yield to Him all belief and obedience. Again, who can contemplate His omnipotence,
His clemency, His willing beneficence, and not repose in Him all his hopes? Finally, who can behold the riches
of His goodness and love, which He lavishes on us, and not love Him? Hence the exordium and the conclusion
used by God in Scripture when giving His commands: I, the Lord.




What They Forbid

The (negative) part of this Commandment is comprised in these words: Thou shalt not have strange gods before
me. This the Lawgiver subjoins, not because it is not sufficiently expressed in the affirmative part of the
precept, which means: Thou shalt worship me, the only God, for if He is God, He is the only God; but on
account of the blindness of many who of old professed to worship the true God and yet adored a multitude of




                                                       224
gods. Of these there were many even among the Hebrews, whom Elias reproached with having halted between
two sides, and also among the Samaritans, who worshipped the God of Israel and the gods of the nations.




Importance Of This Commandment

After this it should be added that this is the first and principal Commandment, not only in order, but also in its
nature, dignity and excellence. God is entitled to infinitely greater love and obedience from us than any lord or
king. He created us, He governs us, He nurtured us even in the womb, brought us into the world, and still
supplies us with all the necessaries of life and maintenance.




Sins Against This Commandment

Against this Commandment all those sin who have not faith. hope and charity. such sinners are very numerous,
for they include all who fall into heresy, who reject what holy mother the Church proposes for our belief, who
give credit to dreams. fortune-telling, and such illusions; those who, despairing of salvation, trust not in the
goodness of God; and those who rely solely on wealth, or health and strength of body. But these matters are
developed more at length in treatises on sins and vices.




Veneration And Invocation Of Angels And Saints Not Forbidden By This Commandment

In explanation of this Commandment it should be accurately taught that the veneration and invocation of holy
Angels and of the blessed who now enjoy the glory of heaven, and likewise the honour which the Catholic
Church has always paid even to the bodies and ashes of the Saints, are not forbidden by this Commandment. If a
king ordered that no one else should set himself up as king, or accept the honours due to the royal person, who
would be so foolish as to infer that the sovereign was unwilling that suitable honour and respect should be paid
to his magistrates? Now although Christians follow the example set by the Saints of the Old Law, and are said
to adore the Angels, yet they do not give to Angels that honour which is due to God alone.

And if we sometimes read that Angels refused to be worshipped by men, we are to know that they did so
because the worship which they refused to accept was the honour due to God alone.




It Is Lawful To Honour And Invoke The Angels

The Holy Spirit who says: Honour and glory to God alone, commands us also to honour our parents and elders;
and the holy men who adored one God only are also said in Scripture to have adored, that is, supplicated and
venerated kings. If then kings, by whose agency God governs the world, are so highly honoured, shall it be
deemed unlawful to honour those angelic spirits whom God has been pleased to constitute His ministers, whose
services He makes use of not only in the government of His Church, but also of the universe, by whose aid,
although we see them not, we are every day delivered from the greatest dangers of soul and body ? Are they not
worthy of far greater honour, since their dignity so far surpasses that of kings?

Add to this their love towards us, which, as we easily see from Scripture, prompts them to pour out their prayers
for those countries over which they are placed, as well as for us whose guardians they are, and whose prayers
and tears they present before the throne of God Hence our Lord admonishes us in the Gospel not to offend the
little ones because their angels in heaven always see the face of their Father who is in heaven.


                                                       225
Their Intercession, therefore, we ought to invoke, because they always see tile face of God, and are constituted
by Him the willing advocates of our salvation. The Scriptures bear witness to such invocation. Jacob entreated
the Angel with whom he wrestled to bless him; nay, he even compelled him, declaring that he would not let him
go until he had blessed him. And not only did he invoke the blessing of the Angel whom he saw, but also of him
whom he saw not. The angel, said he, who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys.




It Is Lawful To Honour And Invoke The Saints

From all this we may conclude that to honour the Saints who nave slept in the Lord, to invoke them, and to
venerate their sacred relics and ashes, far from diminishing, tends considerably to increase the glory of God, in
proportion as man's hope is thus animated and fortified, and he himself encouraged to imitate the Saints.

This is a practice which is also supported by the authority' of the second Council of Nice, the Councils of
Gangra, and of Trent, and by the testimony of the Fathers. In order, however, that the pastor may be the better
prepared to meet the objections of those who deny this doctrine, he should consult particularly St. Jerome
against Vigilantius and St. Damascene. To the teaching of these Fathers should be added as a consideration of
prime importance that the practice was received from the Apostles, and has always been retained and preserved
in the Church of God.

But who can desire a stronger or more convincing proof than that which is supplied by the admirable praises
given in Scripture to the Saints? For there are not wanting eulogies which God Himself pronounced on some of
the Saints. If, then, Holy Writ celebrates their praises, why should not men show them singular honour ?

A stronger claim which the Saints have to be honoured and invoked is that they constantly pray for our
salvation and obtain for us by their merits and influence many blessings from God. If there is joy in heaven over
the conversion of one sinner, will not the citizens of heaven assist those who repent? When they are invoked,
will they not obtain for us the pardon of sins, and the grace of God ?




Objections Answered

Should it be said, as some say, that the patronage of the Saints is unnecessary, because God hears our prayers
without the intervention of a mediator, this impious assertion is easily met by the observation of St. Augustine:
There are many things which God does not grant without a mediator and intercessor. This is confirmed by the
well-known examples of Abimelech and the friends of Job who were pardoned only through the prayers of
Abraham and of Job

Should it be alleged that to recur to the patronage and intercession of the Saints argues want or weakness of
faith, what will (the objectors) answer regarding the centurion whose faith was highly eulogised by the Lord
God Himself, despite the fact that he had sent to the Redeemer the ancients of the Jews, to intercede for his sick
servant?

True, there is but one Mediator, Christ the Lord, who alone has reconciled us to the heavenly Father through His
blood, and who, having obtained eternal redemption, and having entered once into the holies, ceases not to
intercede for us. But it by no means follows that it is therefore unlawful to have recourse to the intercession of
the Saints. If, because we have one Mediator Jesus Christ, it were unlawful to ask the intercession of the Saints,
the Apostle would never have recommended himself with so much earnestness to the prayers of his brethren on
earth. For the prayers of the living would lessen the glory and dignity of Christ's Mediatorship not less than the
intercession of the Saints in heaven.




                                                       226
The Honour And Invocation Of Saints Is Approved By Miracles

But who would not be convinced of the honour due the Saints and of the help they give us by the wonders
wrought at their tombs? Diseased eyes, hands, and other members are restored to health; the dead are raised to
life, and demons are expelled from the bodies of men ! These are facts which St. Ambrose and St. Augustine,
most unexceptionable witnesses, declare in their writings, not that they heard, as many did, nor that they read,
as did man- very reliable men, but that they saw.

But why multiply proofs? If the clothes, the handkerchiefs, and even the very shadows of the Saints, while yet
on earth, banished disease and restored health, who will have the hardihood to deny that God can still work the
same wonders by the holy ashes, the bones and other relics of the Saints ? Of this we have a proof in the
restoration to life of the dead body which was accidentally let down into the grave of Eliseus, and which, on
touching the body (of the Prophet), was instantly restored to life.

"Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in
the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth: thou shalt not adore them
nor serve them"

Some, supposing these words which come next in order to constitute a distinct precept, reduce the ninth and
tenth Commandments to one. St. Augustine, on the contrary, considering the last two to be distinct
Commandments, makes the words just quoted a part of the first Commandment. His division is much approved
in the Church, and hence we willingly adopt it. Furthermore, a very good reason for this arrangement at once
suggests itself. It was fitting that to the first Commandment should be added the rewards or punishments
entailed by each one of the Commandments.




The Above Words Do Not Forbid All Images

Let no one think that this Commandment entirely forbids the arts of painting, engraving or sculpture. The
Scriptures inform us that God Himself commanded to be made images of Cherubim, and also the brazen
serpent. The interpretation, therefore, at which we must arrive, is that images are prohibited only inasmuch as
they are used as deities to receive adoration, and so to injure the true worship of God.




They Forbid Idols And Representations Of The Deity

As far as this Commandment is concerned, it is clear that there are two chief ways in which God's majesty can
be seriously outraged. The first way is by worshipping idols and images as God, or believing that they possess
any divinity or virtue entitling them to our worship, by praying to, or reposing confidence in them, as the
Gentiles did, who placed their hopes in idols, and whose idolatry the Scriptures frequently condemn. The other
way is by attempting to form a representation of the Deity, as if He were visible to mortal eyes, or could be
reproduced by colours or figures. Who, says Damascene, can represent God, invisible, as He is, incorporeal,
uncircumscribed by limits, and incapable of being reproduced under any shape. This subject is treated more at
large in the second Council of Nice. Rightly, then, did the Apostles say (of the Gentiles): They changed the
glory of the incorruptible God into a likeness of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things; for they
worshipped all these things as God, seeing that they made the images of these things to represent Him. Hence
the Israelites, when they exclaimed before the image of the calf: These are thy gods, Israel, that have brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, are denounced as idolaters, because they changed their glory into the likeness of a
calf that eateth grass.



                                                       227
When, therefore, the Lord had forbidden the worship of strange gods, He also forbade the making of an image
of the Deity from brass or other materials, in order thus utterly to do away with idolatry. It is this that Isaias
declares when he asks: To whom then have you likened God, or what image will you make for hill? That this is
the meaning of the prohibition contained in the Commandment is proved, not only from the writings of the holy
Fathers, who, as may be seen in the seventh General Council, give to it this interpretation: but is also clearly
declared in these words of Deuteronomy, by which Moses sought to withdraw the people from the worship of
idols: You saw not, he says, any similitude in the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb, from the midst of the
fire. These words this wisest of legislators spoke, lest through error of any sort, they should make an image of
the Deity, and transfer to any thing created, the honour due to God.




They Do Not Forbid Representations Of The Divine Persons And Angels

To represent the Persons of the Holy Trinity by certain forms under which they appeared in the Old and New
Testaments no one should deem contrary to religion or the law of God. For who can be so ignorant as to believe
that such forms are representations of the Deity? -- forms, as the pastor should teach, which only express some
attribute or action ascribed to God. Thus when from the description of Daniel God is painted as the Ancient of
days, seated on a throne, with the books opened before hint, the eternity of God is represented and also the
infinite wisdom, by which He sees and judges all the thoughts and actions of men.'

Angels, also, are represented under human form and with wings to give us to understand that they are actuated
by benevolent feelings towards mankind, and are always prepared to execute the Lord's commands; for they are
all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation.

What attributes of the Holy Ghost are represented under the forms of a dove, and of tongues of fire, in the
Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles, is a matter too well known to require lengthy explanation.




They Do Not Forbid Images Of Christ And The Saints

But to make and honour the images of Christ our Lord, of His holy and virginal Mother, and of the Saints, all of
whom were clothed with human nature and appeared in human form, is not only not forbidden by this
Commandment, but has always been deemed a holy practice and a most sure indication of gratitude. This
position is confirmed by the monuments of the Apostolic age, the General Councils of the Church, and the
writings of so many among the Fathers, eminent alike for sanctity and learning, all of whom are of one accord
upon the subject.




Usefulness Of Sacred Images

But the pastor should not content himself with showing that it is lawful to have images in churches, and to pay
them honour and respect, since this respect is referred to their prototypes. He should also show that the
uninterrupted observance of this practice down to the present day has been attended with great advantage to the
faithful, as may be seen in the work of Damascene on images, and in the seventh General Council, the second of
Nice.

But as the enemy of mankind, by his wiles and deceits, seeks to pervert even the most holy institutions, should
the faithful happen at all to offend in this particular, the pastor, in accordance with the decree of the Council of
Trent's should use every exertion in his power to correct such an abuse, and, if necessary, explain the decree
itself to the people.



                                                        228
He will also inform the unlettered and those who may be ignorant of the use of images, that they are intended to
instruct in the history of the Old and New Testaments, and to revive from time to time their memory; that thus,
moved by the contemplation of heavenly things, we may be the more ardently inflamed to adore and love God
Himself. He should, also, point out that the images of the Saints are placed in churches, not only to be
honoured, but also that they may admonish us by their examples to imitate their lives and virtues.

"I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love
me, and keep my commandments."

In this concluding clause of this Commandment two things occur which demand careful exposition. The first is,
that while, on account of the enormous guilt incurred by the violation of the first Commandment, and the
propensity of man towards its violation, the punishment is properly indicated in this place, it is also attached to
all the other Commandments.

Every law enforces its observance by rewards and punishments; and hence the frequent and numerous promises
of God in Sacred Scripture. To omit those that we meet almost on every page of the Old Testament, it is written
in the Gospel: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments; and again: He that doth the will of my Father
who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; and also: Every tree that doth not yield good fruit
shall be cut down and cast into the fire; Whosoever is angry with his brother shall be guilty of the judgment; If
you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.




How The Sanction Contained In The Above Words Should Be Proposed

The other observation is that this concluding part (of the Commandment) is to be proposed in a very different
manner to the spiritual and to the carnal Christian. To the spiritual who is animated by the Spirit of God, and
who yields to Him a willing and cheerful obedience, it is, in some sort, glad tidings and a strong proof of the
divine goodness towards him. In it he recognises the care of his most loving God, who, now by rewards, now by
punishments, almost compels His creatures to adore and worship Him. The spiritual man acknowledges the
infinite goodness of God towards himself in vouchsafing to issue His commands to him and to make use of his
service to the glory of the divine name. And not only does he acknowledge the divine goodness, he also
cherishes a strong hope that when God commands what He pleases, He will also give strength to fulfil hat He
commands.

But to the carnal man, who is not yet freed from a servile spirit and who abstains from sin more through fear of
punishment than love of virtue, (this sanction) of the divine law, which closes each of the Commandments, is
burdensome and severe. Wherefore they should be encouraged by pious exhortation, and led by the hand, as it
were, in the way of the law. The pastor, therefore, as often as he has occasion to explain any of the
Commandments should keep this in view.




Mighty

But both the carnal and the spiritual should be spurred on, especially by two considerations which are contained
in this concluding clause, and are highly calculated to enforce obedience to the divine law.

The one is that God is called the strong. That appellation needs to be fully expounded; because the flesh,
unappalled by the terrors of the divine menaces, frequently indulges in the foolish expectation of escaping, in
one way or another, God's wrath and threatened punishment. But when one is deeply impressed with the




                                                       229
conviction that God is the strong, he will exclaim with the great David: Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or
whither shall I pee from thy face?

The flesh, also, distrusting the promises of God, sometimes magnifies the power of the enemy to such an extent,
as to believe itself unable to withstand his assaults; while, on the contrary, a firm and unshaken faith, which
wavers not, but relies confidently on the strength and power of God, animates and confirms man. For it says:
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?




Jealous

The second spur is the jealousy of God. Man is sometimes tempted to think that God takes no interest in human
affairs, and does not even care whether we observe or neglect His law. This error is the source of the great
disorders of life. But when we believe that God is a jealous God, the thought easily keeps us within the limits of
our duty.

The jealousy attributed to God does not, however, imply disturbance of mind; it is that divine love and charity
by which God will suffer no human creature to be unfaithful to Him with impunity, and which destroys all those
who are disloyal to Him. The jealousy of God, therefore, is the most tranquil and impartial justice, which
repudiates as an adulteress the soul corrupted by. erroneous opinions and criminal passions.

This jealousy of God, since it shows His boundless and incomprehensible goodness towards us, we find most
sweet and pleasant. Among men there is no love more ardent, no greater or more intimate tie, than that of those
who are united by marriage. Hence when God frequently compares Himself to a spouse or husband and calls
Himself a jealous God, He shows the excess of His love towards us.




Zeal In The Service Of God

The pastor, therefore, should here teach that men should be so warmly interested in promoting the worship and
honour of God as to be said rather to be jealous of Him than to love Him, in imitation of Him who says of
Himself: With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts, or rather of Christ Himself, who says: The
zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.




"Visiting The Iniquity," Etc.

Concerning the threat contained in this Commandment it should be explained that God will not suffer sinners to
go unpunished, but will chastise them as a father, or punish them with the rigour and severity of a judge. This
was elsewhere explained by Moses when he said: Thou shalt know that the Lord thy God is a strong and faithful
God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a
thousand generations; and repaying forthwith them that hate him. You will not, says Josue, be able to serve the
Lord; for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your wickedness and sins. If you leave
the Lord and serve strange gods, he will turn and will afflict you, and will destroy you.

The faithful are also to be taught that the punishments here threatened await the third and fourth generation of
the impious and wicked; not that the children are always chastised for the sins of their ancestors, but that while
these and their children may go unpunished, their posterity shall not all escape the wrath and vengeance of the
Almighty. This happened in the case of King Josias. God had spared him for his singular piety, and allowed him
to be gathered to the tomb of his fathers in peace, that his eyes might not behold the evils of the times that were



                                                       230
to befall Juda and Jerusalem, on account of the wickedness of his grandfather Manasses; yet, after his death the
divine vengeance so overtook his posterity that even the children of Josias were not spared.

How the words of this Commandment are not at variance with the statement of the Prophet: The soul that sins
shall die, is clearly shown by the authority of St. Gregory, supported by the testimony of all the ancient Fathers.
Whoever, he says, follows the bad example of a wicked father is also bound by his sins; but he who does not
follow the example of his father, shall not at all suffer for the sins of the father Hence it follows that a wicked
son, who dreads not to add his own malice to the vices of his father, by which he knows the divine wrath to
have been excited, pays the penalty not only of his own sins, but also of those of his father. It is just that he who
dreads not to walk in the footsteps of a wicked father, in presence of a rigorous judge, should be compelled in
the present life to expiate the crimes of his wicked parent.




"And Showing Mercy, Etc.

The pastor should next observe that the goodness and mercy of God far exceed His justice. He is angry to the
third and fourth generation; but He bestows His mercy on thousands.




"Of Them That Hate Me"

The words of them that hate me display the grievousness of sin. What more wicked, what more detestable than
to hate God, the supreme goodness and sovereign truth? This, however, is the crime of all sinners; for as he that
hath God's commandments and keepeth them, loveth God, so he who despises His law and violates His
Commandments, is justly said to hate God.




Of Them That Love Me

The concluding words: And to them that love me, point out the manner and motive of observing the law. Those
who obey the law of God must needs be influenced in its observance by the same love and charity which they
bear to God, a principle which should be brought to mind in the instructions on all the other Commandments.




    THE SECOND COMMANDMENT : "Thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain"




Why This Commandment Is Distinct From The First

The second Commandment of the divine law is necessarily comprised in the first, which commands us to
worship God in piety and holiness For he who requires that honour be paid him, also requires that he be spoken
of with reverence, and must forbid the contrary, as is clearly shown by these words of the Lord in Malachy: The
son honoureth the father and the servant his master if then I be a father, where is my honour?

However, on account of the importance of the obligation, God wished to make the law, which commands His
own divine and most holy name to be honoured, a distinct Commandment, expressed in the clearest and
simplest terms.



                                                        231
Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment

The above observation should strongly convince the pastor that on this point it is not enough to speak in general
terms; that the importance of the subject is such as to require it to be dwelt upon at considerable length, and to
be explained to the faithful in all its bearings with distinctness, clearness and accuracy.

This diligence cannot be deemed superfluous, since there are not wanting those who are so blinded by the
darkness of error as not to dread to blaspheme His name, whom the Angels glorify Men are not deterred by the
Commandment laid down from shamelessly and daringly outraging Him divine Majesty every day, or rather
every hour and moment of the day Who is ignorant that every assertion is accompanied with an oath and teems
with curses and imprecations? To such lengths has this impiety been carried, that there is scarcely anyone who
buys, or sells, or transacts business of any sort, without having recourse to swearing, and who, even in matters
the most unimportant and trivial, does not profane the most holy name of God thousands of times.

It therefore becomes more imperative on the pastor not to neglect, carefully and frequently, to admonish the
faithful how grievous and detestable is this crime.




Positive Part of this Commandment

But in the exposition of this Commandment it should first be shown that besides a negative, it also contains a
positive precept, commanding the performance of a duty To each of these a separate explanation should be
given; and for the sake of easier exposition what the Commandment requires should be first set forth, and then
what it forbids It commands us to honour the name of God, and to swear by it with reverence It prohibits us to
contemn the divine name, to take it in vain, or swear by it falsely, unnecessarily or rashly.

In the part which commands us to honour the name of God, the command, as the pastor should show the
faithful, is not directed to the letters or syllables of which that name is composed, or in any respect to the mere
name; but to the meaning of a word used to express the Omnipotent and Eternal Majesty of the Godhead,
Trinity in Unity Hence we easily infer the superstition of those among the Jews who, while they hesitated not to
write, dared not to pronounce the name of God, as if the divine power consisted in the four letters, and not in the
signification.

Although this Commandment uses the singular number, Thou shalt not take the name of God, this is not to be
understood to refer to any one name, but to every name by which God is generally designated For He is called
by many names, such as the Lord, the Almighty, the Lord of hosts, the King of kings, the Strong, and by others
of similar nature, which we meet in Scripture and which are all entitled to the same and equal veneration




Various Ways Of Honouring God's Name

It should next be taught how due honour is to be given to the name of God Christians, whose tongues should
constantly celebrate the divine praises, are not to be ignorant of a matter so important, indeed, most necessary to
salvation The name of God may be honoured in a variety of ways; but all may be reduced to those that follow.




Public Profession Of Faith




                                                       232
In the first place, God's name is honoured when we publicly and confidently confess Him to be our Lord and
our God; and when we acknowledge and also proclaim Christ to be the author of our salvation.




Respect For The Word Of God

(It is also honoured) when we pay a religious attention to the word of God, which announces to us His will;
make it the subject of our constant meditation; and strive by reading or hearing it, according to our respective
capacities and conditions of life, to become acquainted with it.




Praise And Thanksgiving

Again, we honour and venerate the name of God, when, from a sense of religious duty, we celebrate His praises,
and under all circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, return Him unbounded thanks Thus spoke the
Prophet Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee. Among the Psalms of David there
are many, in which, animated with singular piety towards God, he chants in sweetest strains the divine praises
There is also the example of the admirable patience of Job, who, when visited with the heaviest and most
appalling calamities, never ceased, with lofty and unconquered soul, to give praise to God When, therefore, we
labour under affliction of mind or body, when oppressed by misery and misfortune, let us instantly direct all our
thoughts, and all the powers of our souls, to the praises of God, saying with Job Blessed be the name of the
Lord.




Prayer

The name of God is not less honoured when we confidently invoke His assistance, either to relieve us from our
afflictions, or to give us constancy and strength to endure them with fortitude This is in accordance with the
Lord's own wishes Call upon me, He says, in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
We have illustrious examples of such supplications in many passages of Scripture, and especially in the
sixteenth, forty-third, and one hundred and eighteenth Psalms.




Oaths

Finally, we honour the name of God when we solemnly call upon Him to witness the truth of what we assert
This mode of honouring God's name differs much from those already- enumerated Those means are in their
own nature so good, so desirable, that our days and nights could not be more happily or more holily spent than
in such practices of piety I will bless the Lord at all times, says David, his praise shall be always in my mouth.
On the other hand, although oaths are in themselves good, their frequent use is by no means praiseworthy.

The reason of this difference is that oaths have been instituted only as remedies to human frailty, and a
necessary means of establishing the truth of what we assert As it is inexpedient to have recourse to medicine
unless, when it becomes necessary, and as its frequent use is harmful; so with regard to oaths, it is not profitable
to have recourse to them, unless there is a weighty and just cause; and frequent recurrence to them, far from
being advantageous, is on the contrary highly prejudicial Hence the excellent observation of St Chrysostom
Oaths were introduced among men, not at the beginning of the world, but long after; when vice had spread far
and wide over the earth; when all things were disturbed and universal confusion reigned out; when, to complete
human depravity, almost all mankind debased the dignity of their nature by the degrading service of idols. Then



                                                        233
at length it was that the custom of oaths was introduced. For the perfidy and wickedness of men was so great
that it was with difficulty that anyone could be induced to credit the assertion of another, and they began to call
on God as a witness.




Meaning Of An Oath

Since in explaining this part of the Commandment the chief object is to teach the faithful how to render an oath
reverential and holy, it is first to be observed, that to swear, whatever the form of words may be, is nothing else
than to call God to witness; thus to say, God is witness, and By God, mean one and the same thing.

To swear by creatures, such as the holy Gospels, the cross, the names or relics of the Saints, and so on, in order
to prove our statements, is also to take an oath Of themselves, it is true, such objects give no weight or authority
to an oath; it is God Himself who does this, whose divine majesty shines forth in them Hence to swear by the
Gospel is to swear by God Himself, whose truth is contained and revealed in the Gospel (This holds equally true
with regard to those who swear) by the Saints, who are the temples of God, who believed the truth of His
Gospel, were faithful in its observance, and spread it far and wide among the nations and peoples.

This is also true of oaths uttered by way of execration, such as that of St Paul I call God to witness upon my
soul. By this form of oath one submits himself to God's judgment, who is the avenger of falsehood We do not,
however, deny that some of these forms may be used without constituting an oath; but even in such cases it will
be found useful to observe what has been said with regard to an oath, and to conform exactly to the same rule
and standard.




Oaths Are Affirmatory And Promissory

Oaths are of two kinds The first is an affirmatory oath, and is taken when we religiously affirm anything, past or
present. Such was the affirmation of the Apostle in his Epistle to the Galatians: Behold, before God, I lie not.
The second kind, to which comminations may be reduced, is called promissory It looks to the future, and is
taken when we promise and affirm for certain that such or such a thing will be done Such was the oath of
David, who, swearing by the Lord his God, promised to Bethsabee his wife that her son Solomon should be heir
to his kingdom and successor to his throne.




Conditions Of A Lawful Oath

Although to constitute an oath it is sufficient to call God to witness, yet to constitute a holy and just oath many
other conditions are required, which should be carefully explained These, as St Jerome observes, are briefly
enumerated in the words of Jeremias Thou shalt swear: as the Lord liveth, in truth and in judgment and in
justice, words which briefly sum up all the conditions that constitute the perfection of an oath, namely, truth,
judgment, justice.




First Condition: Truth

Truth, then, holds the first place in an oath What is asserted must be true and he who swears must believe what
he swears to be true, being influenced not by rash judgment or mere conjecture, but by solid reasons.




                                                        234
Truth is a condition not less necessary in a promissory than in an affirmatory oath He who promises must be
disposed to perform and fulfil his promise at the appointed time As no conscientious man will promise to do
what he considers opposed to the most holy Commandments and will of God; so, having promised and sworn to
do what is lawful, he will never fail to adhere to his engagement, unless, perhaps by a change of circumstances
it should happen that, if he wished to keep faith and observe his promises, he must incur the displeasure and
enmity of God That truth is necessary to an oath David also declares in these words: He that sweareth to his
neighbour, and deceiveth not.




Second Condition: Judgment

The second condition of an oath is judgment. An oath is not to be taken rashly and inconsiderately, but after
deliberation and reflection. When about to take an oath, therefore, one should first consider whether he is
obliged to take it, and should weigh well the whole case, reflecting whether it seems to call for an oath. Many
other circumstances of time, place, etc., are also to be taken into consideration; and one should not be
influenced by love or hatred, or any other passion, but by the nature and necessity of the case.

Unless this careful consideration and reflection precede, an oath must be rash and hasty; and of this character
are the irreligious affirmations of those, who, on the most unimportant and trifling occasions, swear without
thought or reason from the influence of bad habit alone. This we see practiced daily everywhere among buyers
and sellers. The latter, to sell at the highest price, the former to purchase at the cheapest rate, make no scruple to
strengthen with an oath their praise or dispraise of the goods on sale.

Since, therefore, judgment and prudence are necessary, and since children are not able, on account of their
tender years, to understand and judge accurately, Pope St. Cornelius decreed that an oath should not be
administered to children before puberty, that is, before their fourteenth year.




Third Condition: Justice

The last condition (of an oath) is justice, which is especially requisite in promissory oaths. Hence, if a person
swear to do what is unjust or unlawful, he sins by taking the oath, and adds sin to sin by executing his promise.
Of this the Gospel supplies an example. King Herod, bound by a rash oath, gave to a dancing girl the head of
John the Baptist as a reward for her dancing. Such was also the oath taken by the Jews, who, as we read in the
Acts of the Apostles, bound themselves by oath not to eat, until they had killed Paul.




Lawfulness Of Oaths

These explanations having been given, there can be no doubt that they who observe the above conditions and
who guard their oaths with these qualities as with bulwarks, may swear with a safe conscience.

This is easily established by many proofs. For the law of God, which is pure and holy, commands: Thou shalt
fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his name. All they, writes David, shall
be praised that swear by him.

The Scriptures also inform us that the most holy Apostles, the lights of the Church, sometimes made use of
oaths, as appears from the Epistles of the Apostle.




                                                        235
Even the Angels sometimes swear. The angel, writes St. John in the Apocalypse, swore by him who lives for
ever.

Nay, God Himself, the Lord of Angels, swears, and, as we read in many passages of the Old Testament, has
confirmed His. promises with an oath. This He did to Abraham and to David. Of the oath sworn by God David
says: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: thou art a priest for ever according to the order of
Melchisedech.

In fact, if we consider the whole matter attentively, and examine the origin and purpose of an oath, it can be no
difficult matter to explain the reasons why it is a laudable act.

An oath has its origin in faith, by which men believe God to be the author of all truth, who can never deceive
others nor be deceived, to whose eyes all things are naked and open, who, in fine, superintends all human affairs
with an admirable providence, and governs the world. Filled with this faith we appeal to God as a witness of the
truth, as a witness whom it would be wicked and impious to distrust.

With regard to the end of an oath, its scope and intent is to establish the justice and innocence of man, and to
terminate disputes and contests. This is the doctrine of the Apostle in his Epistle to the Hebrews.




An Objection Against Oaths

Nor does this doctrine at all clash with these words of the Redeemer, recorded in St. Matthew: You have heard
that it was said to them of old: "Thou shalt not foreswear thyself, but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord";
but I say to you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; neither by the earth, for it is
his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king; neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your speech be "yea, yea"; "no, no"; and that which is over
and above these is of evil.

It cannot be asserted that these words condemn oaths universally and under all circumstances, since we have
already seen that the Apostles and our Lord Himself made frequent use of them. The object of our Lord was
rather to reprove the perverse opinion of the Jews, who had persuaded themselves that the only thing to be
avoided in an oath was a lie. Hence in matters the most trivial and unimportant they did not hesitate to make
frequent use of oaths, and to exact them from others. This practice the Redeemer condemns and reprobates, and
teaches that an oath is never to be taken unless necessity require it. For oaths have been instituted on account of
human frailty. They are really the outcome of evil, being a sign either of the inconstancy of him who takes
them, or of the obstinacy of him who refuses to believe without them. However, an oath can be justified by
necessity.

When our Lord says: Let your speech be "yea, yea"; "no, no," He evidently forbids the habit of swearing in
familiar conversation and on trivial matters. He therefore admonishes us particularly against being too ready
and willing to swear; and this should be carefully explained and impressed on the minds of the faithful. That
countless evils grow out of the unrestrained habit of swearing is proved by the evidence of Scripture, and the
testimony of the most holy Fathers. Thus we read in Ecclesiasticus: Let not thy mouth be accustomed to
swearing, for in it there are many falls; and again: A man that sweareth much shall be filled with iniquity, and a
scourge shall not depart from his house. In the works of St. Basil and St. Augustine against lying, much more
can be found on this subject.




Negative Part of this Commandment




                                                        236
So far we have considered what this Commandment requires. It now remains to speak of what it prohibits;
namely, to take the name of God in vain. It is clear that he who swears rashly and without deliberation commits
a grave sin. That this is a most serious sin is declared by the words: Thou shalt not take the name of thy God in
vain, which seem to assign the reason why this crime is so wicked and heinous; namely, that it derogates from
the majesty of Him whom we profess to recognise as our Lord and our God. This Commandment, therefore,
forbids to swear falsely, because he who does not shrink from so great a crime as to appeal to God to witness
falsehood, offers a grievous Injury to God, charging Him either with ignorance, as though the truth of any
matter could be unknown to Him, or with malice and dishonesty, as though God could bear testimony to
falsehood.




Various Ways In Which Cod's Name Is Dishonoured: False Oaths

Among false swearers are to be numbered not only those who affirm as true what they know to be false, but also
those who swear to what is really true, believing it to be false. For since the essence of a lie consists in speaking
contrary to one's belief and conviction, these persons are evidently guilty of a lie, and of perjury.

On the same principle, he who swears to that which he thinks to be true, but which is really false, also incurs the
guilt of perjury, unless he has used proper care and diligence to arrive at a full knowledge of the matter.
Although he-swears according to his belief, he nevertheless sins against this Commandment.

Again, he who binds himself by oath to the performance of anything, not intending to fulfil his promise, or,
having had the intention, neglect its performance, guilty of the same sin. This equally applies to those who,
having bound themselves to God by vow, neglect its fulfilment.




Unjust Oaths

This Commandment is also violated, if justice, which is one of the three conditions of an oath, be wanting.
Hence he who swears to commit a mortal sin, for example, to perpetrate murder, violates this Commandment,
even though he speak seriously and from his heart, and his oath possess what we before pointed out as the first
condition of every oath, that is, truth.

To these are to be added oaths sworn through a sort of contempt, such as an oath not to observe the Evangelical
counsels, such as celibacy and poverty. None, it is true, are obliged to embrace these divine counsels, but by
swearing not to observe them, one contemns and despises them.




Rash Oaths

This Commandment is also sinned against, and judgment is violated when one swears to what is true and what
he believes to be true if his motives are light conjectures and far-fetched reasons. For, notwithstanding its truth,
such an oath is not unmixed with a sort of falsehood, seeing that he who swears with such indifference exposes
himself to extreme danger of perjury.




Oaths By False Gods




                                                        237
To swear by false gods is likewise to swear falsely. What more opposed to truth than to appeal to lying and false
deities as to the true God?




Irreverent Speech

Scripture when it prohibits perjury, says: Thou shalt not profane the name of thy God, thereby forbidding all
irreverence towards all other things to which, in accordance with this Commandment, reverence is due. Of this
nature is the Word of God, the majesty of which has been revered not only by the pious, but also sometimes by
the impious, as is narrated in Judges of Eglon, King of the Moabites.

But he who, to support heresy and the teaching of the wicked. distorts the Sacred Scriptures from their genuine
and true meaning, is guilty of the greatest injury to the Word of God; and against this crime we are warned by
these words of the Prince of the Apostles: There are certain things hard to be understood. which the unlearned
and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.

It is also a foul and shameful contamination of the Scripture, that wicked men pervert the words and sentences
which it contains, and which should be honoured with all reverence, turning them to profane purposes, such as
scurrility, fable, vanity, flattery, detraction, divination, satire and the like -- crimes which the Council of Trent
commands to be severely punished.




Neglect Of Prayer

In the next place, as they honour God who, in their affliction implore His help, so they, who do not invoke His
aid, deny Him due honour; and these David rebukes when he says: They have not called upon the Lord, they
trembled for fear where there was no fear.




Blasphemy

Still more enormous is the guilt of those who, with impure and defiled lips, dare to curse or blaspheme the holy
name of God-that name which is to be blessed and praised above measure by all creatures, or even the names of
the Saints who reign with Him in glory.' So atrocious and horrible is this crime that the Sacred Scriptures,
sometimes when speaking of blasphemy use the word blessing.




Sanction of this Commandment

As, however, the dread of punishment has often a powerful effect in checking the tendency to sin, the pastor, in
order the more effectively to move the minds of men and the more easily to induce to an observance of this
Commandment, should diligently explain the remaining words, which are, as it were, its appendix: For the Lord
will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.

In the first place (the pastor) should teach that with very good reason has God joined threats to this
Commandment. From this is understood both the grievousness of sin and the goodness of God toward us, since
far from rejoicing in man's destruction, He deters us by these salutary threats from incurring His anger,
doubtless in order that we may experience His kindness rather than His wrath. The pastor should urge and insist
on this consideration with greatest earnestness. in order that the faithful may be made sensible of the


                                                         238
grievousness of the crime, may detest it still more, and may employ increased care and caution to avoid its
commission.

He should also observe how prone men are to this sin, since it was not sufficient to give the command, but also
necessary to accompany it with threats. The advantages to be derived from this thought are indeed incredible;
for as nothing is more injurious than a listless security, so the knowledge of our own weakness is most
profitable.

He should next show that God has appointed no particular punishment. The threat is general; it declares that
whoever is guilty of this crime shall not escape unpunished. The various chastisements, therefore, with which
we are every day visited, should warn us against this sin. It is easy to conjecture that men are afflicted with
heavy calamities because they violate this Commandment; and if these things are called to their attention, it is
likely that they will be more careful for the future.

Deterred, therefore, by a holy dread, the faithful should use every exertion to avoid this sin. If for every idle
word that men shall speak, they shall render an account on the day of judgment, what shall we say of those
heinous crimes which involve great contempt of the divine name?




THIRD COMMANDMENT : "Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day. Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy works; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god; thou shalt do
no work on it, neither thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the lord made heaven and
earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the lord
blessed the seventh day and sanctified it."




Reasons For This Commandment

This Commandment of the Law rightly and in due order prescribes the external worship which we owe to God;
for it is, as it were, a consequence of the preceding Commandment. For if we sincerely and devoutly worship
God, guided by the faith and hope we have in Him, we cannot but honour Him with external worship and
thanksgiving. Now since we cannot easily discharge these duties while occupied in worldly affairs, a certain
fixed time has been set aside so that it may be conveniently performed.




Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment

The observance of this Commandment is attended with wondrous fruit and advantage. Hence it is of the highest
importance for the pastor to use the utmost diligence in its exposition. The word Remembers with which the
Commandment commences, must animate him to zeal in this matter; for if the faithful are bound to remember
this Commandment, it becomes the duty of the pastor to recall it frequently to their minds in exhortation and
instruction.

The importance of its observance for the faithful may be inferred from the consideration that those who
carefully comply with it are more easily induced to keep all the other Commandments. For among the other
works which are necessary on holydays, the faithful are bound to assemble in the church to hear the Word of
God. When they have thus learned the divine justifications, they will be disposed to observe, with their whole
heart, the law of the Lord. Hence the sanctification and observance of the Sabbath is very often commanded in




                                                        239
Scripture, as may be seen in Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and in the prophecies of Isaias, Jeremias," and
Ezechiel, all of which contain this precept on the observance of the Sabbath.

Rulers and magistrates should be admonished and exhorted to lend the sanction and support of their authority to
the pastors of the Church, particularly in upholding and extending the worship of God, and in commanding
obedience to the injunctions of the priests.




How The Third Differs From The Other Commandments

With regard to the exposition of this Commandment, the faithful are carefully to be taught how it agrees with,
and how it differs from the others, in order that they may understand why we observe and keep holy not
Saturday but Sunday.

The point of difference is evident. The other Commandments of the Decalogue are precepts of the natural law,
obligatory at all times and unalterable. Hence, after the abrogation of the Law of Moses, all the Commandments
contained in the two tables are observed by Christians, not indeed because their observance is commanded by
Moses, but because they are in conformity with nature which dictates obedience to them.

This Commandment about the observance of the Sabbath, on the other hand, considered as to the time
appointed for its fulfilment, is not fixed and unalterable, but susceptible of change, and belongs not to the moral,
but the ceremonial law. Neither is it a principle of the natural law; we are not instructed by nature to give
external worship to God on that day, rather than on any other. And in fact the Sabbath was kept holy only from
the time of the liberation of the people of Israel from the bondage of Pharaoh. The observance of the Sabbath
was to be abrogated at the same time as the other Hebrew rites and ceremonies, that is, at the death of Christ.
Having been, as it were, images which foreshadowed the light and the truth, these ceremonies were to disappear
at the coming of that light and truth, which is Jesus Christ. Hence St. Paul, in his Epistle to the Galatians, when
reproving the observers of the Mosaic rites, says: You observe days and months and times and years; I am
afraid of you lest perhaps I have laboured in vain amongst you. And he writes to the same effect to the
Colossians.

So much regarding the difference (between this and the other Commandments) .




How The Third Is Like The Other Commandments

This Commandment is like the others, not in so far as it is a precept of the ceremonial law, but only as it is a
natural and moral precept. The worship of God and the practice of religion, which it comprises, have the natural
law for their basis. Nature prompts us to give some time to the worship of God. This is demonstrated by the fact
that we find among all nations public festivals consecrated to the solemnities of religion and divine worship.

As nature requires some time to be given to necessary functions of the body, to sleep, repose and the like, so she
also requires that some time be devoted to the mind, to refresh itself by the contemplation of God. Hence, since
some time should be devoted to the worship of the Deity and to the practice of religion, this (Commandment)
doubtless forms part of the moral law.




The Jewish Sabbath Changed To Sunday By The Apostles




                                                       240
The Apostles therefore resolved to consecrate the first day of the week to the divine worship, and called it the
Lord's day. St. John in the Apocalypse makes mention of the Lord's day; and the Apostle commands collections
to be made on the first day of the week, that is, according to the interpretation of St. Chrysostom, on the Lord's
day. From all this we learn that even then the Lord's day was kept holy in the Church.




Four Parts Of This Commandment

In order that the faithful may know what they are to do and what to avoid on the Lord's day, it will not be
foreign to his purpose, if the pastor, dividing the Commandment into its four natural parts, explain each word of
it carefully.




First Part of this Commandment

In the first place, then, he should explain generally the meaning of these words: Remember that thou keep holy
the sabbath day.




"Remember"

The word remember is appropriately made use of at the beginning of the Commandment to signify that the
sanctification of that particular day belonged to the ceremonial law. Of this it would seem to have been
necessary to remind the people; for, although the law of nature commands us to devote a certain portion of time
to the external worship to God, it fixes no particular day for the performance of this duty.

They are also to be taught, that from these words we may learn how we should employ our time during the
week; that we are to keep constantly in view the Lord's day, on which we are, as it were, to render an account to
God for our occupations and conduct; and that therefore our works should be such as not to be unacceptable in
the sight of God, or, as it is written, be to us an occasion of grief, and a scruple of heart.

Finally, we are taught, and the instruction demands our serious attention, that there will not be wanting
occasions which may lead to a forgetfulness of this Commandment, such as the evil example of others who
neglect its observance, and an inordinate love of amusements and sports, which frequently withdraw from the
holy and religious observance of the Lord's day.




Sabbath

We now come to the meaning of the word sabbath. Sabbath is a Hebrew word which signifies cessation. To
keep the Sabbath, therefore, means to cease from labor and to rest. In this sense the seventh day was called the
Sabbath, because God, having finished the creation of the world, rested on that day from all the work which He
had done. Thus it is called by the Lord in Exodus.

Later on, not only the seventh day, but, in honour of that day, the entire week was called by the same name; and
in this meaning of the word, the Pharisee says in St. Luke: I fast twice in a sabbath. So much will suffice with
regard to the signification of the word sabbath.




                                                       241
"Keep Holy"

In the Scriptures keeping holy the Sabbath means a cessation from bodily labor and from business, as is clear
from the following words of the Commandment: Thou shalt do no work on it. But this is not all that it means;
otherwise it would have been sufficient to say in Deuteronomy, Observe the day of the sabbath; but it is added,
and sanctify it; and these additional words prove that the Sabbath is a day sacred to religion, set apart for works
of piety and devotion.

We sanctify the Sabbath fully and perfectly, therefore, when we offer to God works of piety and religion. This
is evidently the Sabbath, which Isaias calls delightful; for festivals are, as it were, the delight of God and of
pious men. And if to this religious and holy observance of the Sabbath we add works of mercy, the rewards
promised us in the same chapter are numerous and most important.

The true and proper meaning, therefore, of this Commandment tends to this, that we take special care to set
apart some fixed time, when, disengaged from bodily labor and worldly affairs, we may devote our whole
being, soul and body, to the religious veneration of God.




Second Part of this Commandment

The second part of the precept declares that the seventh day was consecrated by God to His worship; for it is
written: Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy works; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy
God. From these words we learn that the Sabbath is consecrated to the Lord, that we are required on that day to
render Him the duties of religion, and to know that the seventh day is a sign of the Lord's rest.




"The Seventh Day Is The Sabbath Of The Lord Thy God"

This particular day was fixed for the worship of God, because it would not have been well to leave to a rude
people the choice of a time of worship, lest, perhaps, they might have imitated the festivals of the Egyptians.

The last day of the week was, therefore, chosen for the worship of God, and in this there is much that is
symbolic. Hence in Exodus,' and in Ezechiel the Lord calls it a sign: See that you keep my sabbath because it is
a sign between me and you in your generation, that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctify you.

It was a sign that man should dedicate and sanctify himself to God, since even the very day is devoted to Him.
For the holiness of the day consists in this, that on it men are bound in a special manner to practice holiness and
religion.

It was also a sign, and, as it were, a memorial of the stupendous work of the creation. Furthermore, to the Jews
it was a traditional sign, reminding them that they had been delivered by the help of God from the galling yoke
of Egyptian bondage. This the Lord Himself declares in these words: Remember that thou also didst serve in
Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand and a stretched out arm.
Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath day.

It is also a sign of a spiritual and celestial sabbath. The spiritual sabbath consists in a holy and mystical rest,
wherein the old man being buried with Christ, is renewed to life and carefully applies himself to act in
accordance with the spirit of Christian piety. For those who were once darkness but are now light in the Lord,




                                                        242
should walk as children of the light, in all goodness and justice and truth, having no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness.

The celestial sabbath, as St. Cyril observes on these words of the Apostle, There remaineth therefore a day of
rest for the people of God, is that life in which, living with Christ, we shall enjoy all good, when sin shall be
eradicated, according to the words: No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by it, nor be
found there; but a path shall be there, and it shall be called the holy way; for in the vision of God the souls of
the Saints obtain every good. The pastor therefore should exhort and animate the faithful in the words: Let us
hasten therefore to enter into that rest.




Other Festivals Observed By The Jews

Besides the seventh day, the Jews observed other festivals and holydays, instituted by the divine law to awaken
the recollection of the principal favours (conferred on them by the Almighty).




The Sabbath, Why Changed To Sunday

But the Church of God has thought it well to transfer the celebration and observance of the Sabbath to Sunday.

For, as on that day light first shone on the world, so by the Resurrection of our Redeemer on the same day, by
whom was thrown open to us the gate to eternal life, we were called out of darkness into light; and hence the
Apostles would have it called the Lord's day.

We also learn from the Sacred Scriptures that the first day of the week was held sacred because on that day the
work of creation commenced, and on that day the Holy Ghost was given to the Apostles.




Other Festivals Observed By The Church

From the very infancy of the Church and in the following centuries other days were also appointed by the
Apostles and the holy Fathers, in order to commemorate the benefits bestowed by God. Among these days to be
kept sacred the most solemn are those which were instituted to honour the mysteries of our redemption. In the
next place are the days which are dedicated to the most Blessed Virgin Mother, to the Apostles, Martyrs and
other Saints who reign with Christ. In the celebration of their victories the divine power and goodness are
praised, due honour is paid to their memories, and the faithful are encouraged to imitate them.




"Six Days Shalt Thou Labour And Do All Thy Work"

And as the observance of the precept is very strongly assisted by these words: Six days shalt thou labour, but on
the seventh day is the sabbath of God, the pastor should therefore carefully explain them to the people. For from
these words it can be gathered that the faithful are to be exhorted not to spend their lives in indolence and sloth,
but that each one, mindful of the words of the Apostle, should do his own business, and work with his own
hands, as he had commanded them.




                                                        243
These words also enjoin as a duty commanded by God that in six days we do all our works, lest we defer to a
festival what should have been done during the other days of the week, thereby distracting the attention from
the things of God.




Third Part of this Commandment

The third part of the Commandment comes next to be explained. It points out, to a certain extent, the manner in
which we are to keep holy the Sabbath day, and explains particularly what we are forbidden to do on that day.




Works Forbidden

Thou shalt do no work on it, says the Lord, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy
maid-servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.

These words teach us, in the first place, to avoid whatever may interfere with the worship of God. Hence it is
not difficult to perceive that all servile works are forbidden, not because they are improper or evil in themselves,
but because they withdraw the attention from the worship of God, which is the great end of the Commandment.

The faithful should be still more careful to avoid sin, which not only withdraws the mind from the
contemplation of divine things, but entirely alienates us from the love of God.




Works Permitted

But whatever regards the celebration of divine worship, such as the decoration of the altar or church on
occasion of some festival, and the like, although servile works, are not prohibited; and hence our Lord says: The
priests in the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame.

Neither are we to suppose that this Commandment forbids attention to those things on a feast day, which, if
neglected, will be lost; for this is expressly permitted by the sacred canons.

There are many other things which our Lord in the Gospel declares lawful on festivals and which may be seen
by the pastor in St. Matthew and St. John.




Why Animals Are Not To Be Employed On The Sabbath

To omit nothing that may interfere with the sanctification of the Sabbath, the Commandment mentions beasts of
burden, because their use will prevent its due observance. If beasts be employed on the Sabbath, human labor
also becomes necessary to direct them; for they do not labor alone, but assist the labours of man. Now it is not
lawful for man to work on that day. Hence it is not lawful for the animals to work which man uses.

But the Commandment has also another purpose. For. if God commands the exemption of cattle from labor on
the Sabbath, still more imperative is the obligation to avoid all acts of inhumanity towards servants, or others
whose labor and industry we employ.




                                                       244
Works Commanded Or Recommended

The pastor should also not omit carefully to teach what works and actions Christians should perform on festival
days. These are: to go to church, and there, with heartfelt piety and devotion, to assist at the celebration of the
Holy Sacrifice of the Mass; and to approach frequently the Sacraments of the Church, instituted for our
salvation in order to obtain a remedy for the wounds of the soul.

Nothing can be more seasonable or salutary for Christians than frequent recourse to confession; and to this the
pastor will be enabled to exhort the faithful by using the instructions and proofs which have been explained in
their own place on the Sacrament of Penance.

But not only should he urge his people to have recourse to that Sacrament, he should also zealously exhort them
again and again to approach frequently the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist.

The faithful should also listen with attention and reverence to sermons. Nothing is more intolerable, nothing
more unworthy than to despise the words of Christ, or hear them with indifference.

Likewise the faithful should give themselves to frequent prayer and the praises of God; and an object of their
special attention should be to learn those things which pertain to a Christian life, and to practice with care the
duties of piety, such as giving alms to the poor and needy, visiting the sick, and administering consolation to the
sorrowful and afflicted. Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this, says St. James, to visit
the fatherless and widows in their tribulation.

From what has been said it is easy to perceive how this Commandment may be violated.




Motives for the Observance of this Commandment

It is also a duty of the pastor to have ready at hand certain main arguments by which he may especially persuade
the people to observe this Commandment with all zeal and the greatest exactitude.




Reasonableness Of This Duty

To the attainment of this end it will materially conduce, if the people understand and clearly see how just and
reasonable it is to devote certain days exclusively to the worship of God in order to acknowledge, adore, and
venerate our Lord from whom we have received such innumerable and inestimable blessings.

Had He commanded us to offer Him every day the tribute of religious worship, would it not be our duty, in
return for His inestimable and infinite benefits towards us, to endeavour to obey the command with promptitude
and alacrity? But now that the days consecrated to His worship are but few, there is no excuse for neglecting or
reluctantly performing this duty, which moreover obliges under grave sin.




The Observance Of This Commandment Brings Many Blessings




                                                       245
The pastor should next point out the excellence of this precept. Those who are faithful in its observance are
admitted, as it were, into the divine presence to speak freely with God; for in prayer we contemplate the divine
majesty, and commune with Him; in hearing religious instruction, we hear the voice of God, which reaches us
through the agency of those who devoutly preach on divine things; and at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, we
adore Christ the Lord, present on our altars. Such are the blessings which they preeminently enjoy who
faithfully observe this Commandment.




Neglect Of This Commandment A Great Crime

But those who altogether neglect its fulfilment resist God and His Church; they heed not God's command, and
are enemies of Him and His holy laws, of which the easiness of the command is itself a proof. We should, it is
true, be prepared to undergo the severest labor for the sake of God; but in this Commandment He imposes on us
no labor; He only commands us to rest and disengage ourselves from worldly cares on those days which are to
be kept holy. To refuse obedience to this Commandment is, therefore, a proof of extreme boldness; and the
punishments with which its infraction has been visited by God, as we learn from the Book of Numbers,' should
be a warning to us.

In order, therefore, to avoid offending God in this way, we should frequently ponder this word: Remember, and
should place before our minds the important advantages and blessings which, as we have already seen, flow
from the religious observance of holydays, and also numerous other considerations of the same tendency, which
the good and zealous pastor should develop at considerable length to his people as circumstances may require.




THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT : "Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be long lived
upon the land which the lord thy god will give thee."




Relative Importance Of The Preceding And The Following Commandments

The preceding Commandments are supreme both in dignity and in importance; but those which follow rank next
in order because of their necessity. For the first three tend directly to God; while the object of the others is the
charity we owe to our neighbour, although even these are ultimately referred to God, since we love our
neighbour on account of God, our last end. Hence Christ our Lord has declared that the two Commandments
which inculcate the love of God and of our neighbour are like unto each other.




Importance Of Instruction On The Fourth Commandment

The advantages arising from the present subject can scarcely be expressed in words; for not only does it bring
with it its own fruit, and that in the richest abundance and of superior excellence, but it also affords a test of our
obedience to and observance of the first Commandment. He that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, says St.
John, how can he love God whom he seeth not? In like manner, if we do not honour and reverence our parents
whom we ought to love next to God and whom we continually see, how can we honour or reverence God, the
supreme and best of parents, whom we see not? Hence we can easily perceive the similarity between these two
Commandments.

The application of this Commandment is of very great extent. Besides our natural parents, there are many others
whose power, rank, usefulness, exalted functions or office, entitle them to parental honour.



                                                         246
Furthermore.(this Commandment) lightens the labor of parents and superiors; for their chief care is that those
under them should live according to virtue and the divine Law. Now the performance of this duty will be
considerably facilitated, if it be known by all that highest honour to parents is an obligation, sanctioned and
commanded by God.




The Two Tables Of The Law

To impress the mind with this truth it will be found useful to distinguish the Commandments of the first, from
those of the second table. This distinction, therefore, the pastor should first explain.

Let him begin by showing that the divine precepts of the Decalogue were written on two tables, one of which, in
the opinion of the holy Fathers, contained the three preceding, while the rest were given on the second table.

This order of the Commandments is especially appropriate, since the very collocation points out to us their
difference in nature. For whatever is commanded or prohibited in Scripture by the divine law springs from one
of two principles, the love of God or of our neighbour: one or the other of these is the basis of every duty
required of us. The three preceding Commandments teach us the love which we owe to God; and the other
seven, the duties which we owe to our neighbour and to public society. The arrangement, therefore, which
assigns some of the Commandments to the first and others to the second table is not without good reason.

In the first three Commandments, which have been explained, God, the supreme good, is, as it were, the subject
matter; in the others, it is the good of our neighbour. The former require the highest love, the latter the love next
to the highest. The former have to do with our last end, the latter with those things that lead us to our end.

Again, the love of God terminates in God Himself, for God is to be loved above all things for His own sake; but
the love of our neighbour originates in, and is to be regulated by, the love of God. If we love our parents, obey
our masters, respect our superiors, our ruling principle in doing so should be that God is their Creator, and
wishes to give pre-eminence to those by whose cooperation He governs and protects other men; and as He
requires that we yield a dutiful respect to such persons, we should do so, because He deems them worthy of this
honour. If, then, we honour our parents, the tribute is paid to God rather than to man. Accordingly we read in St.
Matthew concerning duty to superiors: He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and the Apostle in his Epistle to the
Ephesians, giving instruction to servants, says: Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ: not serving to the eye, as it were
pleasing men, but as the servants of Christ.

Moreover, no honour, no piety, no devotion can be rendered to God sufficiently worthy of Him, since love of
Him admits of infinite increase. Hence our charity should become every day more fervent towards Him, who
commands us to love Him with our whole heart, our whole soul, and with all our strength. The love of our
neighbour, on the contrary, has its limits, for the Lord commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves.

To outstep these limits by loving our neighbour as we love God would be an enormous crime. If any man come
to me, says the Lord and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea,
and his own life also; he cannot be my disciple. In the same way, to one who would first attend the burial of his
father, and then follow Christ, it was said: Let the dead bury their dead; and the same lesson is more clearly
conveyed in St. Matthew: He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.

Parents, no doubt, are to be highly loved and respected; but religion requires that supreme honour and homage
be given to Him alone, who is the Creator and Father of all, and that all our love for our earthly parents be
referred to our eternal Father who is in heaven. Should, however, the injunctions of parents be at any time
opposed to the Commandments of God, children are, o{ course, to prefer the will of God to the desires of their
parents, always keeping in view the divine maxim: We ought to obey God rather than men.



                                                        247
Explanation of the Fourth Commandment: "Honour"

After these preliminaries the pastor should explain the words of the Commandment, beginning with honour. To
honour is to think respectfully of anyone, and to hold in the highest esteem all that relates to him. It includes
love, respect, obedience and reverence.

Very properly, then, is the word honour used here in preference to the word fear or love, although parents are
also to be much loved and feared. Respect and reverence are not always the accompaniments of love; neither is
love the inseparable companion of fear; but honour, when proceeding from the heart, combines both fear and
love.




"Thy Father"

The pastor should next explain who they are, whom the Commandment designates as fathers; for although the
law refers primarily to our natural fathers, yet the name belongs to others also, and these seem to be indicated in
the Commandment, as we can easily gather from numerous passages of Scripture. Besides our natural fathers,
then, there are others who in Scripture are called fathers, as was said above, and to each of these proper honour
is due.

In the first place, the prelates of the Church, her pastors and priests are called fathers, as is evident from the
Apostle, who, writing to the Corinthians, says: I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as
my dearest children. For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus
by the gospel I have begotten you. It is also written in Ecclesiasticus: Let us praise men of renown, and our
fathers in their generation.

Those who govern the State, to whom are entrusted power, magistracy, or command, are also called fathers;
thus Naaman was called father by his servants.

The name father is also applied to those to whose care, fidelity, probity and wisdom others are committed, such
as teachers, instructors masters and guardians; and hence the sons of the Prophets called Elias and Eliseus their
father. Finally, aged men, advanced in years, we also call fathers.




Why Parents Should Be Honoured

In his instructions the pastor should chiefly emphasise the obligation of honouring all who are entitled to be
called fathers, especially our natural fathers, of whom the divine Commandment particularly speaks. They are,
so to say, images of the immortal God. In them we behold a picture of our own origin; from them we have
received existence, them God made use of to infuse into us a soul and reason, by them we were led to the
Sacraments, instructed in our religion, schooled in right conduct and holiness, and trained in civil and human
knowledge.




"And Thy Mother"




                                                       248
The pastor should teach that the name mother is mentioned in this Commandment, in order to remind us of her
benefits and claims in our regard, of the care and solicitude with which she bore us, and of the pain and labor
with which she gave us birth and brought us up.




Manner Of Honouring Parents

The honour which children are commanded to pay to their parents should be the spontaneous offering of sincere
and dutiful love. This is nothing more than their due, since for love of us, they shrink from no labor, no
exertion, no danger. Their highest pleasure it is to fed that they are loved by their children, the dearest objects of
their affection. Joseph, when he enjoyed in Egypt the highest station and the most ample power after the king
himself, received with honour his father, who had come into Egypt. Solomon rose to meet his mother as she
approached; and having paid her respect, placed her on a royal throne on his right hand.

We also owe to our parents other duties of respect, such as to supplicate God in their behalf, that they may lead
prosperous and happy lives, beloved and esteemed by all who know them, and most pleasing in the sight of God
and of the Saints in heaven.

We also honour them by submission to their wishes and inclinations. My son, says Solomon, hear the instruct-
on of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother; that grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold
to thy neck. Of the same kind are the exhortations of St. Paul. Children, he says, obey your parents in the Lord,
for this is just; and also, children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. (This
doctrine) is confirmed by the example of the holiest men. Isaac, when bound for sacrifice by his father, meekly
and uncomplainingly obeyed; and the Rechabites, not to depart from the counsel of their father, always
abstained from wine.

We also honour our parents by the imitation of their good example; for, to seek to resemble closely anyone is
the highest mark of esteem towards him. We also honour them when we not only ask, but follow their advice.

Again we honour our parents when we relieve their necessities, supplying them with necessary food and
clothing according to these words of Christ, who, when reproving the impiety of the Pharisees, said: Why do
you also transgress the commandments of God because of your traditions? For God said: "Honour thy father
and thy mother," and "He that shall curse father or mother let him die the death." But you say: "Whosoever shall
say to his father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee." And he shall not honour
his father or his mother; and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.

But if at all times it is our duty to honour our parents, this duty becomes still more imperative when they are
visited by severe illness. We should then see to it that they do not neglect confession and the other Sacraments
which every Christian should receive at the approach of death. We should also see that pious and religious
persons visit them frequently to strengthen their weakness, assist them by their counsel, and animate them to the
hope of immortality, that having risen above the concerns of this world, they may fix their thoughts entirely on
God. Thus blessed with the sublime virtues of faith, hope and charity, and fortified by the helps. of religion,
they will not only look at death without fear, since it is necessary, but will even welcome it, as it hastens their
entrance into eternity.

Finally, we honour our parents, even after their death, by attending their funerals, procuring for them suitable
obsequies and burial, having due suffrages and anniversary Masses offered for them, and faithfully executing
their last wills.




Manner Of Honouring Other Superiors



                                                        249
We are bound to honour not only our natural parents, but also others who are called fathers, such as Bishops and
priests, kings, princes and magistrates, tutors, guardians and masters, teachers, aged persons and the like, all of
whom are entitled, some in a greater, some in a less degree, to share our love, our obedience, and our assistance.




The Honour Due To Bishops And Priests

Of Bishops and other pastors it is written: Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

What wondrous proofs of love for the Apostle must the Galatians have shown ! For he bears this splendid
testimony of their benevolence: I bear you witness that if it could be done, you would hove plucked out your
own eyes, and would have given them to me.

The priest is also entitled to receive whatever is necessary for his support. Who, says the Apostle, serveth as a
soldier at his own charges? Give honour to the priests, it is written in Ecclesiasticus, and purify thyself with thy
arms; give them their portion, as it is commanded thee, of the first fruits and of purifications.

The Apostle also teaches that they are entitled to obedience: Obey your prelates, and be subject to them; for
they watch as being to render an account of your souls. Nay, more. Christ the Lord commands obedience even
to wicked pastors: Upon the chair of Moses have sitten the scribes and Pharisees: all things, therefore,
whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do; but according to their works do ye not, for they say and do
not.




The Honour Due To Civil Rulers

The same is to be said of civil rulers, governors, magistrates and others to whose authority we are subject. The
Apostle in his Epistle to the Romans, explains at length the honour, respect and obedience that should be shown
them, and he also bids us to pray for them. St. Peter says: Be ye subject, therefore, to every human creature for
God's sake; whether it be to the king as excelling, or to governors as sent by him.

For whatever honour we show them is given to God, since exalted human dignity deserves respect because it is
an image of the divine power, and in it we revere the providence of God who has entrusted to men the care of
public affairs and who uses them as the instruments of His power.

If we sometimes have wicked and unworthy officials it is not their faults that we revere, but the authority from
God which they possess. Indeed, while it may seem strange, we are not excused from highly honouring them
even when they show themselves hostile and implacable towards us. Thus David rendered great services to Saul
even when the latter was his bitter foe, and to this he alludes when he says: With them that hated peace I was
peaceable.

However, should their commands be wicked or unjust, they should not be obeyed, since in such a case they rule
not according to their rightful authority, but according to injustice and perversity.




'That Thou Mayest be Long-lived," etc.

Having explained the above matters, the pastor should next consider the reward promised to the observance of
this Commandment and its appropriateness. That reward is great, indeed, for it consists principally in length of


                                                        250
days. They who always preserve the grateful remembrance of a benefit deserve to be blessed with its prolonged
enjoyment. Children, therefore, who honour their parents, and gratefully acknowledge the blessing of life
received from them are deservedly rewarded with the protracted enjoyment of that life to an advanced age.




Reward Promised For Observance Of This Commandment

The (nature of the) divine promise also demands distinct explanation. It includes not only the eternal life of the
blessed, but also the life which we lead on earth, according to the interpretation of St. Paul: Piety is profitable to
all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come

Many very holy men, it is true, such as Job, David, Paul, desired to die, and a long life is burdensome to the
afflicted and wretched: but the reward which is here promised is, notwithstanding, neither inconsiderable, nor to
be despised.

The additional words, which the Lord thy God will give thee, promise not only length of days, but also repose,
tranquillity, and security to live well; for in Deuteronomy it is not only said, that thou mayest live a long time,
but it is also added, and that it may be well with thee, words afterwards quoted by the Apostle.




Why This Reward Is Not Always Conferred On Dutiful Children

These blessings, we say, are conferred on those whose piety God rewards; otherwise the divine promises would
not be fulfilled, since the more dutiful child is sometimes the more short lived.

Now this happens sometimes because it is better for him to depart from this world before he has strayed from
the path of virtue and of duty; for he was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit
beguile his soul. Or because destruction and general upheaval are impending, he is called away that he may
escape the calamities of the times. The just man, says the Prophet, is taken away from before the face of evil,
lest his virtue and salvation be endangered when God avenges the crimes of men. Or else, he is spared the bitter
anguish of witnessing the calamities of his friends and relations in such evil days. The premature death of the
good, therefore, gives special reason for fear.




Punishment For Violation Of This Commandment

But if God promises rewards and blessings to grateful children, He also reserves the heaviest chastisements to
punish those who are wanting in filial piety; for it is written: He that curseth his father or mother shall die the
death: He that afflicteth his father and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy." He that curseth his
father and mother, his lamp shall be put out in the midst of darkness: The eye that mocketh at his father, and
that despiseth the labour of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young
eagles eat it. There are on record many instances of undutiful children, who were made the signal objects of the
divine vengeance. The disobedience of Absalom to his father David did not go unpunished. On account of his
sin he perished miserably, transfixed by three lances.

Of those who resist the priest it is written: He that will be proud, and refuse to obey the commandment of the
priest, who ministereth at that time to the Lord thy God, by the decree of the judge, that man shall die.




                                                        251
Duties of Parents Towards their Children

As the law of God commands children to honour, obey, and respect their parents so are there reciprocal duties
which parents owe to their children. Parents are obliged to bring up their children in the knowledge and practice
of religion, and to give them the best rules for the regulation of their lives; so that, instructed and trained in
religion, they may serve God holily and constantly. It was thus, as we read, that the parents of Susanna acted.

The priest, therefore, should admonish parents to be to their children guides in the virtues of justice, chastity,
modesty and holiness.




Three Things To Be Avoided By Parents

He should also admonish them to guard particularly against three things, in which they but too often transgress.

In the first place, they are not by words or actions to exercise too much harshness towards their children. This is
the instruction of St. Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians: Fathers, he says, provoke not your children to anger,
lest they be discouraged. For there is danger that the spirit of the child may be broken, and he become abject
and fearful of everything. Hence (the pastor) should require parents to avoid too much severity and to choose
rather to correct their children than to revenge themselves upon them.

Should a fault be committed which requires reproof and chastisement, the parent should not, on the other hand,
by undue indulgence, overlook its correction. Children are often spoiled by too much lenity and indulgence on
the part of their parents. The pastor, therefore, should deter from such excessive mildness by the warning
example of Heli, the high-priest, who, on account of over-indulgence to his sons, was visited with the heaviest
chastisements.

Finally, to avoid what is most shameful in the instruction and education of children, let them not propose to
themselves aims that are unworthy. Many there are whose sole concern is to leave their children wealth, riches
and an ample and splendid fortune; who encourage them not to piety and religion, or to honourable
employment, but to avarice, and an increase of wealth, and who, provided their children are rich and wealthy,
are regardless of their good name and eternal salvation. Can anything more shameful be thought or expressed?
Of such parents it is true to say, that instead of bequeathing wealth to their children, they leave them rather their
own wickedness and crimes for an inheritance; and instead of conducting them to heaven, lead them to the
eternal torments of hell.

The priest, therefore, should impress on the minds of parents salutary principles and should exhort them to
imitate the virtuous example of Tobias, that having properly trained up their children to the service of God and
to holiness of life, they may, in turn, experience at their hands abundant fruit of filial affection, respect and
obedience.




THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT : "Thou shalt not kill"




Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment

The great happiness proposed to the peacemakers, of being called the children of God, should prove a powerful
incentive to the pastor to explain to the faithful with care and accuracy the obligations imposed by this
Commandment. No means more efficacious can be adopted to promote peace among mankind, than the proper


                                                        252
explanation of this Commandment and its holy and due observance by all. Then might we hope that men, united
in the strictest bonds of union, would live in perfect peace and concord.

The necessity of explaining this Commandment is proved from the following. Immediately after the earth was
overwhelmed in universal deluge, this was the first prohibition made by God to man. I will require the blood of
your lives, He said, at the hand of every beast and at the hand of man. In the next place, among the precepts of
the Old Law expounded by our Lord, this Commandment was mentioned first by Him; concerning which it is
written in the Gospel of St. Matthew: It has been said thou shalt not kill, etc.

The faithful, on their part, should hear with willing attention the explanation of this Commandment, since its
purpose is to protect the life of each one. These words, Thou shalt not kill, emphatically forbid homicide; and
they should be heard by all with the same pleasure as if God, expressly naming each individual, were to prohibit
injury to be offered him under a threat of the divine anger and the heaviest chastisements. As, then, the
announcement of this Commandment must be heard with pleasure, so also should the avoidance of the sin
which it forbids give pleasure.




Two Parts Of This Commandment

In the explanation of this Commandment the Lord points out its twofold obligation. The one is prohibitory and
forbids us to kill; the other is mandatory and commands us to cherish sentiments of charity, concord and
friendship towards our enemies, to have peace with all men, and finally, to endure with patience every
inconvenience.




The Prohibitory Part of this Commandment




Exceptions: The Killing Of Animals

With regard to the prohibitory part, it should first be taught what kinds of killing are not forbidden by this
Commandment. It is not prohibited to kill animals; for if God permits man to eat them, it is also lawful to kill
them. When, says St. Augustine, we hear the words, "Thou shalt not kill," we do not understand this of the fruits
of the earth, which are insensible, nor of irrational animals, which form no part of human society.




Execution Of Criminals

Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by
the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this
power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which
prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment- is the preservation and security of human life. Now the
punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end,
since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: In the morning
I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.




Killing In A Just War


                                                         253
In like manner, the soldier is guiltless who, actuated not by motives of ambition or cruelty, but by a pure desire
of serving the interests of his country, takes away the life of an enemy in a just war.

Furthermore, there are on record instances of carnage executed by the special command of God. The sons of
Levi, who put to death so many thousands in one day, were guilty of no sin; when the slaughter had ceased, they
were addressed by Moses in these words: You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord.




Killing By Accident

Again, death caused, not by intent or design, but by accident, is not murder. He that killeth his neighbour
ignorantly, says the book of Deuteronomy, and who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and
the day before, but to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe slipt
out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle struck his friend and killed him, shall live. Such
accidental deaths, because inflicted without intent or design, involve no guilt whatever, and this is confirmed by
the words of St. Augustine: God forbid that what we do for a good and lawful end shall be imputed to us, if,
contrary to our intention, evil thereby befall any one.

There are, however, two cases in which guilt attaches (to accidental death). The first case is when death results
from an unlawful act; when, for instance, a person kicks or strikes a woman in a state of pregnancy, and
abortion follows. The consequence, it is true, may not have been intended, but this does not exculpate the
offender, because the act of striking a pregnant woman is in itself unlawful. The other case is when death is
caused by negligence, carelessness or want of due precaution.




Killing In Self-Defence

If a man kill another in self-defence, having used every means consistent with his own safety to avoid the
infliction of death, he evidently does not violate this Commandment.




Negative Part Of This Commandment Forbids Murder And Suicide

The above are the cases in which life may be taken without violating this Commandment; and with these
exceptions all other killing is forbidden, whether we consider the person who kills, the person killed, or the
means used to kill.

As to the person who kills, the Commandment recognises no exception whatever, be he rich or powerful, master
or-parent. All, without exception or distinction, are forbidden to kill.

With regard to the person killed, the law extends to all. There is no individual, however humble or lowly his
condition, whose life is not shielded by this law.

It also forbids suicide. No man possesses such power over his own life as to be at liberty to put himself to death.
Hence we find that the Commandment does not say: Thou shalt not kill another, but simply: Thou shalt not kill.

Finally, if we consider the numerous means by which murder may be committed, the law admits of no
exception. Not only does it forbid to take away the life of another by laying violent hands on him, by means of a
sword, a stone, a stick, a halter, or by administering poison; but also strictly prohibits the accomplishment of the
death of another by counsel, assistance, help or any other means whatever.


                                                       254
Sinful Anger Is Also Forbidden By The Fifth Commandment

The Jews, with singular dullness of apprehension, thought that to abstain from taking life with their own hands
was enough to satisfy the obligation imposed by this Commandment. But the Christian, instructed in the
interpretation of Christ, has learned that the precept is spiritual, and that it commands us not only to keep our
hands unstained, but our hearts pure and undefiled; hence what the Jews regarded as quite sufficient, is not
sufficient at all. For the Gospel has taught that it is unlawful even to be angry with anyone: But I say to you that
whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother,
"Raca," shall be in danger of the council. And whosoever shall say, "Thou fool," shall be in danger of hell fire.
From these words it clearly follows that he who is angry with his brother is not free from sin, even though he
conceals his resentment; that he who gives indication of his wrath sins grievously; and that he who does not
hesitate to treat another with harshness, and to utter contumelious reproaches against him, sins still more
grievously.

This, however, is to be understood of cases in which no just cause of anger exists. God and His laws permit us
to be angry when we chastise the faults of those who are subject to us. For the anger of a Christian should
spring from the Holy Spirit and not from carnal impulse, seeing that we should be temples of the Holy Ghost, in
which Jesus Christ may dwell.

Our Lord has left us many other lessons of instruction with regard to the perfect observance of this law, such as
Not to resist evil; but if one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other. And if a man will contend
with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him; and whosoever will force thee
one mile, go with him two.




Remedies Against The Violation Of This Commandment

From what has been said, it is easy to see how inclined man is to those sins which are prohibited by this
Commandment, and how many are guilty of murder, if not in fact, at least in desire. As, then, the Sacred
Scriptures prescribe remedies for so dangerous a disease, the pastor should spare no pains in making them
known to the faithful.

Of these remedies the most efficacious is to form a just conception of the wickedness of murder. The enormity
of this sin is manifest from many and weighty passages of Holy Scripture. So much does God abominate
homicide that He declares in Holy Writ that of the very beast of the field He will exact vengeance for the life of
man, commanding the beast that injures man to be put to death. And if (the Almighty) commanded man to have
a horror of blood,' He did so for no other reason than to impress on his mind the obligation of entirely
refraining, both in act and desire, from the enormity of homicide.

The murderer is the worst enemy of his species, and consequently of nature. To the utmost of his power he
destroys the universal work of God by the destruction of man, since God declares that He created all things for
man's sake. Nay, as it is forbidden in Genesis to take human life, because God created man to his own image
and likeness, he who makes away with God's image offers great injury to God, and almost seems to lay violent
hands on God Himself !

David, thinking of this with a mind divinely illumined, complained bitterly of the bloodthirsty in these words:
Their feet are swift to shed blood. He does not simply say, they kill, but, they shed blood, words which serve to
mark the enormity of that execrable crime and to denote the barbarous cruelty of the murderer. With a view also
to describe in particular how the murderer is precipitated by the impulse of the devil into the commission of
such a crime, he says: Their feet are swift.



                                                        255
Positive Part of this commandment




Love Of Neighbour Inculcated

The mandatory part of this Commandment, as Christ our Lord enjoins, requires that we have peace with all
men. Interpreting the Commandment He says: If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou
remember that thy brother hath anything against thee; leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be
reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift, etc.




Charity To All Commanded

In explaining this admonition, the pastor should show that it inculcates the duty of charity towards all without
exception. In his instruction on the precept he should exhort the faithful as much as possible to the practice of
this virtue, since it is especially included in this precept. For since hatred is clearly forbidden by this
Commandment, as whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, it follows, as an evident consequence, that the
Commandment also inculcates charity and love.




Patience, Beneficence And Mildness Commanded

And since the Commandment inculcates charity and love, it must also enjoin all those duties and good offices
which follow in their train. Charity is patient, says St. Paul. We are therefore commanded patience, in which, as
the Redeemer teaches, we shall possess our souls. Charity is kind; beneficence is, therefore, the friend and
companion of charity. The virtue of beneficence and kindness has a great range. Its principal offices are to
relieve the wants of the poor, to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked; and in all these
acts of beneficence we should proportion our liberality to the wants and necessities of those we help.

These works of beneficence and goodness, in themselves exalted, become still more illustrious when done
towards an enemy; for our Saviour says: Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, which also the
Apostle enjoins in these words: If thine enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give hint to drink. For,
doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.

Finally, if we consider the law of charity, which is kind, we shall be convinced that to practice the good offices
of mildness, clemency, and other kindred virtues, is a duty prescribed by that law.




Forgiveness Of Injuries Commanded

But the most important duty of all, and that which is the fullest expression of charity, and to the practice of
which we should most habituate ourselves, is to pardon and forgive from the heart the injuries which we may
have received from others. The Sacred Scriptures, as we have already observed, frequently admonish and exhort
us to a full compliance with this duty. Not only do they pronounce blessed those who do this, but they also
declare that God grants pardon to those who really fulfil this duty, while He refuses pardon to those who neglect
it, or refuse to obey it.



                                                         256
How to Persuade Men to Forgive Injuries

As the desire of revenge is almost natural to man, it becomes necessary for the pastor to exert his utmost
diligence not only to instruct, but also earnestly to persuade the faithful, that a Christian should forgive and
forget injuries; and as this is a duty frequently inculcated by sacred writers, he should consult them on the
subject, in order to be able to subdue the pertinacity of those whose minds are obstinately bent on revenge, and
he should have ready the forcible and appropriate arguments which those Fathers piously employed. The three
following considerations, however, demand particular exposition.




All We Have To Endure Comes From God

First, he who thinks himself injured ought above all to be persuaded that the man on whom he desires to be
revenged was not the principal cause of the loss or injury. Thus that admirable man, Job, when violently injured
by the Sabeans, the Chaldeans, and by Satan, took no account of these, but as a righteous and very holy man
exclaimed with no less truth than piety: The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away. The words and the example
of that man of patience should, therefore, convince Christians, and the conviction is most just, that whatever
chastisements we endure in this life come from the hand of God, the Father and Author of all justice and mercy.
He chastises us not as enemies, but, in His infinite goodness, corrects us as children. To view the matter in its
true light, men, in these cases, are nothing more than the ministers and agents of God. One man, it is true, may
cherish the worst feelings towards another, he may harbour the most malignant hatred against him; but, without
the permission of God, he can do him no injury. This is why Joseph was able patiently to endure the wicked
counsels of his brethren, and David, the injuries inflicted on him by Semei.

Here also applies an argument which St. Chrysostom has ably and learnedly handled. It is that no man is injured
but by himself. Let the man, who considers himself injured by another, consider the matter in the right way and
he will certainly find that he has received no injury or loss from others. For although he may have experienced
injury from external causes, he is himself his greatest enemy by wickedly staining his soul with hatred,
malevolence and envy.




Advantages Of Forgiveness

The second consideration is that there are two advantages, which are the special rewards of those, who,
influenced by a holy desire to please God, freely forgive injuries. In the first place, God has promised that he
who forgives, shall himself obtain forgiveness of sins, a promise which clearly shows how acceptable to God is
this duty of piety. In the next place, the forgiveness of injuries ennobles and perfects our nature; for by it man is
in some degree made like to God, Who maketh his sun to shine on the good and the bad, and raineth upon the
just and the unjust.




Disadvantages Of Revenge

Finally, the disadvantages which arise from the refusal to pardon others are to be explained. The pastor,
therefore, should place before the eyes of the unforgiving man that hatred is not only a grievous sin, but also
that the longer it is indulged the more deeply rooted it becomes. The man, of whose heart this passion has once
taken possession, thirsts for the blood of his enemy. Filled with the hope of revenge, he will spend his days and
nights brooding over some evil design, so that his mind seems never to rest from malignant projects, or even



                                                        257
from thoughts of blood. Thus it follows that never, or at least not without extreme difficulty, can he be induced
generously to pardon an offence, or even to mitigate his hostility. Justly, therefore, is hatred compared to a
wound in which the weapon remains firmly embedded.

Moreover, there are many evil consequences and sins which are linked together with this one sin of hatred.
Hence these words of St. John: He that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth
not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. He must, therefore, frequently fall; for how
can anyone view in a favourable light the words or actions of him whom he hates? Hence arise rash and unjust
judgments, anger, envy, detractions, and other evils of the same sort, in which are often involved those who are
connected by ties of friendship or blood; and thus does it frequently happen that this one sin is the prolific
source of many.

Not without good reason is hatred called the sin of the devil. The devil was a murderer from the beginning; and
hence our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when the Pharisees sought His life, said that they were begotten of
their father the devil.




Remedies Against Hatred

Besides the reasons already adduced, which afford good grounds for detesting this sin, other and most suitable
remedies are prescribed in the pages of Holy Writ.

Of these remedies the first and greatest is the example of the Redeemer, which we should set before our eyes as
a model for imitation. For He, in whom even suspicion of fault could not be found, when scourged with rods,
crowned with thorns, and finally nailed to a cross, uttered that most charitable prayer: Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do. And as the Apostle testifies: The sprinkling of his blood speaketh better than Abel.

Another remedy, prescribed by Ecclesiasticus, is to call to mind death and judgment: Remember thy last end,
and. thou shalt never sin." As if he had said: Reflect frequently and again and again that you must soon die, and
since at death there will be nothing you desire or need more than great mercy from God, that now you should
keep that mercy always before your mind. Thus the cruel desire for revenge will be extinguished; for you can
discover no means better adapted, none more efficacious to obtain the mercy of God than the forgiveness of
injuries and love towards those who in word or deed may have injured you or yours.




THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT : "Thou shalt not commit adultery"




The Position Of This Commandment In The Decalogue Is Most Suitable

The bond between man and wife is one of the closest, and nothing can be more gratifying to both than to know
that they are objects of mutual and special affection. On the other hand, nothing inflicts deeper anguish than to
feel that the legitimate love which one owes the other has been transferred elsewhere. Rightly, then, and in its
natural order, is the Commandment which protects human life against the hand of the murderer, followed by
that which forbids adultery and which aims to prevent anyone from injuring or destroying by such a crime the
holy and honourable union of marriage -- a union which is generally the source of ardent affection and love.




Importance Of Careful Instruction On This Commandment


                                                       258
In the explanation of this Commandment, however, the pastor has need of great caution and prudence, and
should treat with great delicacy a subject which requires brevity rather than copiousness of exposition. For it is
to be feared that if he explained in too great detail or at length the ways in which this Commandment is violated,
he might unintentionally speak of subjects which, instead of extinguishing, usually serve rather to inflame
corrupt passion.

As, however, the precept contains many things which cannot be passed over in silence, the pastor should
explain them in their proper order and place.




Two Parts Of This Commandment

This Commandment, then, resolves itself into two heads; the one expressed, which prohibits adultery; the other
implied, which inculcates purity of mind and body.




What this Commandment Prohibits




Adultery Forbidden

To begin with the prohibitory part (of the Commandment), adultery is the defilement of the marriage bed,
whether it be one's own or another's. If a married man have intercourse with an unmarried woman, he violates
the integrity of his marriage bed; and if an unmarried man have intercourse with a married woman, he defiles
the sanctity of the marriage bed of another.




Other Sins Against Chastity Are Forbidden

But that every species of immodesty and impurity are included in this prohibition of adultery, is proved by the
testimonies of St. Augustine and St. Ambrose; and that such is the meaning of the Commandment is borne out
by the Old, as well as the New Testament. In the writings of Moses, besides adultery, other sins against chastity
are said to have been punished. Thus the book of Genesis records the judgment of Judah against his daughter-
in-law. In Deuteronomy is found the excellent law of Moses, that there should be no harlot amongst the
daughters of Israel. Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, is the exhortation of Tobias to his
son; and in Ecclesiasticus we read: Be ashamed of looking upon a harlot.

In the Gospel, too, Christ the Lord says: From the heart come forth adulteries and fornications, which defile a
man. The Apostle Paul expresses his detestation of this crime frequently, and in the strongest terms: This is the
will of God, your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication; Fly fornication; Keep not company
with fornicators; Fornication, and an uncleanness and covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you;
" Neither fornicators nor adulterers, nor the effeminate nor sodomites shall possess the kingdom of God.




Why Adultery Is Expressly Mentioned




                                                      259
But the reason why adultery is expressly forbidden is- because in addition to the turpitude which it shares with
other kinds of incontinence, it adds the sin of injustice, not only against our neighbour, but also against civil
society.

Again it is certain that he who abstains not from other sins against chastity, will easily fall into the crime of
adultery. By the prohibition of adultery, therefore, we at once see that every sort of immodesty and impurity by
which the body is defiled is prohibited. Nay, that every inward thought against chastity is forbidden by this
Commandment is clear, as well from the very force of the law, which is evidently spiritual, as also from these
words of Christ the Lord: You have heard that it was said to them of old: "Thou shalt not commit adultery." But
I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in
his heart.

These are the points which we have deemed proper matter for public instruction of the faithful. The pastor,
however, should add the decrees of the Council of Trent against adulterers, and those who keep harlots and
concubines, omitting many other species of immodesty and lust, of which each individual is to be admonished
privately, as circumstances of time and person may require.




What this Commandment Prescribes




Purity Enjoined

We now come to explain the positive part of the precept. The faithful are to be taught and earnestly exhorted to
cultivate continence and chastity with all care, to cleanse themselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the
spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God.

First of all they should be taught that although the virtue of chastity shines with a brighter lustre in those who
make the holy and religious vow of virginity, nevertheless it is a virtue which belongs also to those who lead a
life of celibacy; or who, in the married state, preserve themselves pure and undefiled from unlawful desire.




Reflections which Help one to Practice Purity

The holy Fathers have taught us many means whereby to subdue the passions and to restrain sinful pleasure.
The pastor, therefore, should make it his study to explain these accurately to the faithful, and should use the
utmost diligence in their exposition. Of these means some are reflections, others are active measures.




Impurity Excludes From Heaven

The first kind consists chiefly in our forming a just conception of the filthiness and evil of this sin; for such
knowledge will lead one more easily to detest it. Now the evil of this crime we may learn from the fact that, on
account of it, man is banished and excluded from the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all evils.




Impurity Is A Filthy Sin



                                                       260
The above-mentioned calamity is indeed common to every mortal sin. But what is peculiar to this sin is that
fornicators are said to sin against their own bodies, according to the words of the Apostle: Fly fornication.
Every-sin that a man doth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.
The reason is that such a one does an injury to his own body violating its sanctity. Hence St. Paul, writing to the
Thessalonians, says: This is the will of God, your sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication, that
every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the passion of lust,
like the Gentiles that know not God.

Furthermore, what is still more criminal, the Christian who shamefully sins with a harlot makes the members of
Christ the members of an harlot, according to these words of St. Paul: Know you not that your bodies are the
members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? God
forbid. Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? Moreover, a Christian, as St. Paul
testifies is the temple of the Holy Ghost ; and to violate this temple is nothing else than to expel the Holy Ghost.




Adultery Is A Grave Injustice

But the crime of adultery involves that of grievous injustice. If, as the Apostle says, they who are joined in
wedlock are so subject to each other that neither has power or right over his or her body, but both are bound, as
it were, by a mutual bond of subjection, the husband to accommodate himself to the will of the wife, the wife to
the will of the husband; most certainly if either dissociate his or her person, which is the right of the other, from
him or her to whom it is bound, the offender is guilty of an act of great injustice and wickedness.




Adultery Is Disgraceful

As dread of disgrace strongly stimulates to the performance of duty and deters from the commission of crime,
the pastor should also teach that adultery brands its guilty perpetrators with an unusual stigma. He that is an
adulterer, says Scripture, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul: he gathereth to himself shame and
dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out.




Impurity Severely Punished

The grievousness of the sin of adultery may be easily inferred from the severity of its punishment. According to
the law promulgated by God in the Old Testament, the adulterer was stoned to death. Nay more, because of the
criminal passion of one man, not only the perpetrator of the crime, but a whole city was destroyed, as we read
with regard to the Sichemites. The Sacred Scriptures abound with examples of the divine vengeance, such as the
destruction of Sodom and of the neighbouring cities,' the punishment of the Israelites who committed
fornication in the wilderness with the daughters of Moab, and the slaughter of the Benjamites. These examples
the pastor can easily make use of to deter men from shameful lust.




Impurity Blinds The Mind And Hardens The Heart

But even though the adulterer may escape the punishment of death, he does not escape the great pains and
torments that often overtake such sins as his. He becomes afflicted with blindness of mind a most severe
punishment; he is lost to all regard for God, for reputation, for honour, for family, and even for life; and thus,




                                                        261
utterly abandoned and worthless, he is undeserving of confidence in any matter of moment, and becomes
unfitted to discharge any kind of duty.

Of this we find examples in the persons of David and of Solomon. David had no sooner fallen into the crime of
adultery than he degenerated into a character the very reverse of what he had been before; from the mildest of
men he became so cruel as to consign to death Urias, one of his most deserving subjects. Solomon, having
abandoned himself to the lust of women, gave up the true religion to follow strange gods. This sin, therefore, as
Osee observes, takes away man's heart and often blinds his understanding.




Means of practicing purity




Avoidance Of Idleness

We now come to the remedies which consist in action. The first is studiously to avoid idleness; for, according to
Ezechiel, it was by yielding to the enervating influence of idleness that the Sodomites plunged into the most
shameful crime of criminal lust.




Temperance

In the next place, intemperance is carefully to be avoided. I fed them to the full, says the Prophet, and they
committed adultery. An overloaded stomach begets impurity. This our Lord intimates in these words: Take heed
to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness. Be not drunk with wine,
says the Apostle, wherein is luxury.




Custody Of The Eyes

But the eyes, in particular, are the inlets to criminal passion, and to this refer these words of our Lord: If thine
eye scandalise thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee. The Prophets, also, frequently speak to the same effect. I
made a covenant with mine eyes, says Job, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin. Finally, there are on
record innumerable examples of the evils which have their origin in the indulgence of the eyes. It was thus that
David sinned, thus that the king of Sichem fell, and thus also that the elders sinned who calumniated Susanna.




Avoidance Of Immodest Dress

Too much display in dress, which especially attracts the eye, is but too frequently an occasion of sin. Hence the
admonition of Ecclesiasticus: Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up. As women are given to excessive
fondness for dress, it will not be unseasonable in the pastor to give some attention to the subject, and sometimes
to admonish and reprove them in the impressive words of the Apostle Peter: Whose adorning let it not be the
outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel. St. Paul likewise says: Not with
plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire. Many women adorned with gold and precious stones, have lost
the only true ornament of their soul and body.




                                                        262
Avoidance Of Impure Conversation, Reading, Pictures

Next to the sexual excitement, usually provoked by too studied an elegance of dress, follows another, which is
indecent and obscene conversation. Obscene language is a torch which lights up the worst passions of the young
mind; and the Apostle has said, that evil communications corrupt good manners. Immodest and passionate
songs and dances are most productive of this same effect and are, therefore, cautiously to be avoided.

In the same class are to be numbered soft and obscene books which must be avoided no less than indecent
pictures. All such things possess a fatal influence in exciting to unlawful attractions, and in inflaming the mind
of youth. In these matters the pastor should take special pains to see that the faithful most carefully observe the
pious and prudent regulations of the Council of Trent.




Frequentation Of The Sacraments

If the occasions of sin which we have just enumerated be carefully avoided, almost every excitement to lust will
be removed. But the most efficacious means for subduing its violence are frequent use of confession and
Communion, as also unceasing and devout prayer to God, accompanied by fasting and almsdeeds. Chastity is a
gift of God. To those who ask it aright He does not deny it; nor does He suffer us to be tempted beyond our
strength.




Mortification

But the body is to be mortified and the sensual appetites to be repressed not only by fasting, and particularly, by
the fasts instituted by the Church, but also by watching, pious pilgrimages, and other works of austerity. By
these and similar observances is the virtue of temperance chiefly manifested. In connection with this subject, St.
Paul, writing to the Corinthians, says: Every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things;
and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one. A little after he says: I
chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest, perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should
become a castaway. And in another place he says: Make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscence.




THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT : "Thou shalt not steal"




Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment

In the early ages of the Church, it was customary to impress on the minds of hearers the nature and force of this
Commandment. This we learn from the reproof uttered by the Apostle against some who were most earnest in
deterring others from vices, in which they themselves were found freely to indulge: Thou, therefore, that
teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest. The salutary effect
of such instructions was not only to correct a vice then very prevalent, but also to repress quarrels, litigation and
other evils which generally grow out of theft. Since in these our days men are unhappily addicted to the same
vices, with their consequent misfortunes and evils, the pastor, following the example of the holy Fathers and
Doctors, should strongly insist on this point and explain with diligent care the force and meaning of this
Commandment.


                                                        263
This Commandment A Proof Of The Love Of God Towards Us And A Claim On Our Gratitude

In the first place the pastor should exercise care and industry in declaring the infinite love of God for man. Not
satisfied with having fenced round, so to say, our lives, our persons and our reputation, by means of the two
Commandments, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, God defends and places a guard over our
property and possessions, by adding the prohibition, Thou shalt not steal. These words can have no other
meaning than that which we indicated above when speaking of the other Commandments. They declare that
God forbids our worldly goods, which are placed under His protection, to be taken away or injured by anyone.

Our gratitude to God, the author of this law, should be in proportion to the greatness of the benefit the law
confers upon us. Now since the truest test of gratitude and the best means of returning thanks, consists not only
in lending a willing ear to His precepts, but also in obeying them, the faithful are to be animated and encouraged
to an observance of this Commandment.




Two Parts Of This Commandment

Like the preceding Commandments, this one also is divided into two parts. The first, which prohibits theft, is
mentioned expressly; while the spirit and force of the second, which en- forces kindliness and liberality towards
our neighbour, are implied in the first part.




Negative Part of this Commandment




Stealing Forbidden

We shall begin with the prohibitory part of the Commandment, Thou shalt not steal. It is to be observed, that by
the word steal is understood not only the taking away of anything from its rightful owner, privately and without
his consent, but also the possession of that which belongs to another, contrary to the will, although not without
the knowledge, of the true owner; else we are prepared to say that He who prohibits theft does not also prohibit
robbery, which is accomplished by violence and injustice, whereas, according to St. Paul, extortioners shall not
possess the kingdom of God, and their very company and ways should be shunned, as the same Apostle writes.




Theft And Robbery Forbidden

But though robbery is a greater sin than theft, inasmuch as it not only deprives another of his property, but also
offers violence and insult to him; yet it cannot be a matter of surprise that the divine prohibition is expressed
under the milder word, steal, instead of rob. There was good reason for this, since theft is more general and of
wider extent than robbery, a crime which only they can commit who are superior to their neighbour in brute
force and power. Furthermore, it is obvious that when lesser crimes are forbidden, greater enormities of the
same sort are also prohibited.




                                                       264
Various Names Given To Stealing

The unjust possession and use of what belongs to another are expressed by different names, according to the
diversity of the objects taken without the consent and knowledge of the owners To take any private property
from a private individual is called theft; from the public, peculation. To enslave a freeman, or appropriate the
slave of another is called man-stealing. To steal anything sacred is called sacrilege -- a crime most enormous
and sinful, yet so common in our days that what piety and wisdom had set aside for the necessary expenses of
divine worship, for the support of the ministers of religion, and the use of the poor is employed in satisfying
individual avarice and the worst passions.




Desire Of Stealing Forbidden

But, besides actual theft, that is, the outward commission, the will and desire are also forbidden by the law of
God. The law is spiritual and concerns the soul, the source of our thoughts and designs. From the heart, says our
Lord in St. Matthew, come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies.




Gravity Of The Sin Of Stealing

The grievousness of the sin of theft is sufficiently seen by the light of natural reason alone, for it is a violation
of justice which gives to every man his own. The distribution and allotment of property, fixed from the
beginning by the law of nations and confirmed by human and divine laws, must be considered as inviolable, and
each one must be allowed secure possession of what justly belongs to him, unless we wish the overthrow of
human society. Hence these words of the Apostle: Neither thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor
extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.

The long train of evils which this sin entails are a proof at once of its mischievousness and enormity. It gives
rise to hasty and rash judgments, engenders hatred, originates enmities, and sometimes subjects the innocent to
cruel condemnation.

What shall we say of the necessity imposed by God on all of satisfying for the injury done? Without restitution,
says St. Augustine, the sin is not forgiven. The difficulty of making such restitution, on the part of those who
have been in the habit of enriching themselves with their neighbour’s property, we may learn not only from
personal observation and reflection, but also from the testimony of the Prophet Habacuc: Woe to him that
heapeth together what is not his own. How long also doth he load himself with thick clay? The possession of
other men's property he calls thick clay, because it is difficult to emerge and extricate one's self from (ill-gotten
goods).




The Chief Kinds Of Stealing

There are so many kinds of stealing that it is most difficult to enumerate them all; but since the others can be
reduced to theft and robbery, it will be sufficient to speak of these two. To inspire the faithful with a detestation
of such grievous crimes and to deter them from their commission, the pastor should use all care and diligence.
Now let us consider these two kinds of stealing.




Various Forms Of Theft


                                                        265
They are guilty of theft who buy stolen goods, or retain the property of others, whether found, seized, or
pilfered. If you have found, and not restored, says St. Augustine, you have stolen. If the true owner cannot,
however, be discovered, whatever is found should go to the poor. If the finder refuse to make restitution, he
gives evident proof that, were it in his power, he would make no scruple of stealing all that he could lay his
hands on.

Those who, in buying or selling, have recourse to fraud and lying, involve themselves in the same guilt. The
Lord will avenge their trickery. Those who sell bad and adulterated goods as real and genuine, or who defraud
the purchasers by weight, measure, number, or rule, are guilty of a species of theft still more criminal and
unjust. It is written in Deuteronomy: Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag. Do not any unjust thing,
says Leviticus, in judgment, in rule, in weight or in measure. Let the balance be just, and the weights equal, the
bushel just, and the sextary equal. And elsewhere it is written: Divers weights are an abomination before the
Lord; a deceitful balance is not good.

It is, also, a downright theft, when labourers and artisans exact full wages from those to whom they have not
given just and due labor. Again, dishonest servants and agents are no better than thieves, nay they are more
detestable than other thieves; against these everything may be locked, while against a pilfering servant nothing
in a house can be secure by bolt or lock.

They, also, who obtain money under pretence of poverty, or by deceitful words, may be said to steal, and their
guilt is aggravated since they add falsehood to theft.

Persons charged with offices of public or private trust, who altogether neglect, or but indifferently perform their
duties, while they enjoy the salary and emoluments of such offices, are also to be reckoned in the number of
thieves.

To enumerate the various other modes of theft, invented by the ingenuity of avarice, which is versed in all the
arts of making money, would be a tedious and, as already said, a most difficult task.




Various Forms Of Robbery

The pastor, therefore, should next come to treat of robbery, which is the second general division of these crimes.
First, he should admonish the Christian people to bear in mind the teaching of the Apostle: They that will
become rich fall into temptation, and the snare of the devil; and never to forget the rule: All things whatsoever
you will that men do to you, do you also to them; and always to bear in mind the words of Tobias: See thou
never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.

Robbery is more comprehensive than theft. Those who pay not the labourer his hire are guilty of robbery, and
are exhorted to repentance by St. James in these words: Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your
miseries, which shall come upon you. He adds the reason for their repentance: Behold the hire of the labourers,
who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath
entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. This sort of robbery is strongly condemned in Leviticus,
Deuteronomy, Malachy, and Tobias.

Among those who are guilty of robbery are also included persons who do not pay, or who turn to other uses or
appropriate to themselves, customs, taxes, tithes and such revenues, which are owed to the Church or civil
authorities.

To this class also belong usurers, the most cruel and relentless of extortioners, who by their exorbitant rates of
interest, plunder and destroy the poor. Whatever is received above the capital and principal, be it money, or
anything else that may be purchased or estimated by money, is usury; for it is written in Ezechiel: He hath not



                                                        266
lent upon usury, nor taken an increase; and in Luke our Lord says: Lend, hoping for nothing thereby. Even
among the pagans usury was always considered a most grievous and odious crime. Hence the question, "What is
usury ?" was answered: "What is murder?" And, indeed, he who lends at usury sells the same thing twice, or
sells that which has no real existence.

Corrupt judges, whose decisions are venal, and who, bought over by money or other bribes, decide against the
just claims of the poor and needy, also commit robbery.

Those who defraud their creditors, who deny their just debts, and also those who purchase goods on their own,
or on another's credit, with a promise to pay for them at a certain time, and do not keep their word, are guilty of
the same crime of robbery. And it is an aggravation of their guilt that, in consequence of their want of
punctuality and their fraud, prices are raised to the great injury of the public. To such persons seem to apply the
words of David: The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again.

But what shall we say of those rich men who exact with rigour what they lend to the poor, even though the latter
are not able to pay them, and who, disregarding God's law, take as security even the necessary clothing of the
unfortunate debtors ? For God says: If thou take of thy neighbour a garment in pledge, thou shalt give it him
again before sunset, for that same is the only thing wherewith he is covered, the clothing of his body, neither
hath he any other to sleep in: if he cry to me I will hear him, because I am compassionate. Their rigorous
exaction is justly termed rapacity, and therefore robbery.

Among those whom the holy Fathers pronounced guilty of robbery are persons who, in times of scarcity, hoard
up their corn, thus culpably rendering supplies scarcer and dearer. This holds good with regard to all necessaries
of life and sustenance. These are they against whom Solomon utters this execration: He that hideth up corn,
shall be cursed among the people. Such persons the pastor should warn of their guilt, and should reprove with
more than ordinary freedom; he should explain to them at length the punishments which await such sins.

So much for what the seventh Commandment forbids.




Positive Part of this Commandment




Restitution Enjoined

We now come to the positive part of this Commandment, in which the first thing to be considered is satisfaction
or restitution; for without restitution the sin is not forgiven.




Who Are Held To Restitution

But as the law of making restitution to the injured party is binding not only on the person who commits theft,
but also on all who cooperate in the sin, it is necessary to explain who are indispensably bound to this
satisfaction or restitution. There are several classes (who are thus bound).

The first consists of those who order others to steal, and who are not only the authors and accomplices of theft,
but also the most criminal among thieves.

Another class embraces those, who, when they cannot command others to commit theft persuade and encourage
it. These, since they are like the first class in intention, though unlike them in power, are equally guilty of theft.


                                                         267
A third class is composed of those who consent to the theft committed by others.

The fourth class is that of those who are accomplices in, and derive gain from theft; if that can be called gain,
which, unless they repent, consigns them to everlasting torments. Of them David says: If thou didst see a thief,
thou didst run with him.

The fifth class of thieves are those who, having it in their power to prohibit theft, so far from opposing or
preventing it, fully and freely suffer and sanction its commission.

The sixth class is constituted of those who are well aware that the theft was committed, and when it was
committed; and yet, far from mentioning it, pretend they know nothing about it.

The last class comprises all who assist in the accomplishment of theft, who guard, defend, receive or harbour
thieves.

All these are bound to make restitution to those from whom anything has been stolen, and are to be earnestly
exhorted to the discharge of so necessary a duty.

Neither are those who approve and commend thefts entirely innocent of this crime. Children also who steal
from their parents, and wives who steal from their husbands are not guiltless of theft.




Almsdeeds Enjoined

This Commandment also implies an obligation to sympathise with the poor and needy, and to relieve their
difficulties and distresses by our means and good offices. Concerning this subject, which cannot be insisted on
too often or too strongly, the pastor will find abundant matter to enrich his discourses in the works of St.
Cyprian, St. John Chrysostom, St. Gregory Nazianzen, and other eminent writers on almsdeeds.




Inducements To Practice Almsgiving

The pastor, therefore, should encourage the faithful to be willing and anxious to assist those who have to depend
on charity, and should make them realise the great necessity of giving alms and of being really and practically
liberal to the poor, by reminding them that on the last day God will condemn and consign to eternal fires those
who have omitted and neglected the duty of almsgiving, while on the contrary He will praise and introduce into
His heavenly country those who have exercised mercy towards the poor. These two sentences have been already
pronounced by the lips of Christ the Lord: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for
you; and: Depart front me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.

Priests should also cite those texts which are calculated to persuade (to the performance of this important duty):
Give and it shall be given to you. They should dwell on the promise of God, the richest and most abundant that
can be conceived: There is no man who hath left house, or brethren, etc., that shall not receive an hundred times
as much now in this time and in the world to come life everlasting; and he should add these words of our Lord:
Make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of iniquity, that when you shall fail, they may receive you into
everlasting dwellings.




Ways Of Giving Alms



                                                        268
They should also explain the parts of this necessary duty, so that whoever is unable to give may at least lend to
the poor what they need to sustain life, according to the command of Christ our Lord: Lend, hoping for nothing
thereby. The happiness of doing this is thus expressed by holy David: Acceptable is the man that showeth
mercy and lendeth.

But if we are not able to give to those who must depend on the charity of others for their sustenance, it is an act
of Christian piety, as well as a means of avoiding idleness, to procure by our labor and industry what is
necessary for the relief of the poor. To this the Apostle exhorts all by his own example. For yourselves, he says
to the Thessalonians, know how you ought to imitate us; and again, writing to the same people: Use your
endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own, hands, as we commanded
you; and to the Ephesians: He that stole, let him steal no more; but rather let him labour working with his hands
the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.'




Frugality Is Enjoined

We should also practice frugality and draw sparingly on the kindness of others, that we may not be burden or a
trouble to them. The exercise of considerateness is conspicuous in all the Apostles, but preeminently so in St.
Paul. Writing to the Thessalonians he says: You remember, brethren, our labour and toil; working night and day
lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached amongst you the gospel of God. And in another place
the same Apostle says: In labour and in toil, we worked night and day, lest we should be burdensome to any of
you.




Sanction Of This Commandment




The Punishment Of Its Violation

To inspire the faithful with an abhorrence of all infamous sins against this Commandment, the pastor should
have recourse to the Prophets and the other inspired writers, to show the detestation in which God holds the
crimes of theft and robbery, and the awful threats which He denounces against their perpetrators. Hear this,
exclaims the Prophet Amos, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail, saying: "When will
the month be over, and we shall sell our wares, and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn; that we may lessen
the measure, and increase the sickle, and may convey in deceitful balances? Many passages of the same kind
may be found in Jeremias, Proverbs,' and Ecclesiasticus. Indeed it cannot be doubted that such crimes are the
seeds from which have sprung in great part the evils which in our times oppress society.




The Reward Of Observing This Commandment

That Christians may accustom themselves to those acts of generosity and kindness towards the poor and the
needy which are inculcated by the second part of this Commandment, the pastor should place before them those
ample rewards which God promises in this life and in the next to the beneficent and the bountiful.




Excuses for Stealing Refuted




                                                       269
As there are not wanting those who would even excuse their thefts, these are to be admonished that God will
accept no excuse for sin; and that their excuses, far from extenuating, serve only greatly to aggravate their guilt.




The Plea Of Rank And Position

How insufferable the vanity of those men of exalted rank who excuse themselves by alleging that they act not
from cupidity or avarice, but stoop to take what belongs to others only from a desire to maintain the grandeur of
their families and of their ancestors, whose repute and dignity must fall, if not upheld by the possession of
another man's property. Of this harmful error they are to be disabused; and they are to be convinced that the
only means to preserve and augment their wealth and to enhance the glory of their ancestors is to obey the will
of God and observe His Commandments. Once His will and Commandments are contemned, the stability of
property, no matter how securely settled, is overturned; kings are dethroned, and hurled from the highest
stations of honour; while the humblest individuals, men too, towards whom they cherished the most implacable
hatred, are sometimes called by God to occupy their place.

It is incredible to what degree the divine wrath is kindled against such offenders, and this we know from the
testimony of Isaias, who records these words of God: Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves; they all
love bribes, they run after rewards. Therefore, saith the Lord, the God of Hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I
will comfort myself over my adversaries; and I will be revenged of my enemies; and I will turn my hand to thee,
and I will clean purge away thy dross.




The Plea Of Greater Ease And Elegance

Some there are, who plead in justification of such conduct, not the ambition of maintaining splendour and glory,
but a desire of acquiring the means of living in greater ease and elegance. These are to be refuted, and should be
shown how impious are the words and conduct of those who prefer their own ease to the will and the glory of
God whom, by neglecting His Commandments, we offend extremely. And yet what real advantage can there be
in theft? Of how many very serious evils is it not the source? Confusion and repentance, says Ecclesiasticus, is
upon a thief. But even though no disadvantage overtake the thief, he offers an insult to the divine name, opposes
the most holy will of God, and contemns His salutary precepts. From hence result all error, all dishonesty, all
impiety.




The Plea Of The Other's Wealth

But do we not sometimes hear the thief contend that he is not guilty of sin, because he steals from the rich and
the wealthy, who, in his mind, not only suffer no injury, but do not even feel the loss? Such an excuse is as
wretched as it is baneful.




The Plea Of Force Of Habit

Others imagine that they should be excused, because they have contracted such a habit of stealing as not to be
able easily to refrain from such desires and practices. If such persons listen not to the admonition of the Apostle:
He that stole, let him now steal no more, let them recollect that one day, whether they like it or not, they will
become accustomed to an eternity of torments.




                                                        270
The Plea Of Favourable Opportunity

Some excuse themselves by saying that the opportunity presented itself. The proverb is well known: Those who
are not thieves are made so by opportunity. Such persons are to be disabused of their wicked idea by reminding
them that it is our duty to resist every evil propensity. If we yield instant obedience to every inordinate impulse,
what measure, what limits will there be to crime and disorder? Such an excuse, therefore,- is of the lowest
character, or rather is an avowal of a complete want of restraint and justice. To say that you do not commit sin,
because you have no opportunity of sinning, is almost to acknowledge that you are always prepared to sin when
opportunity offers.




The Plea Of Revenge

There are some who say that they steal in order to gratify revenge, having themselves suffered the same injury
from others. To such offenders it should be answered first of all that no one is allowed to return injury for
injury; next that no person can be a judge in his own cause; and finally that still less can it be lawful to punish
one man for the wrong done you by another.




The Plea Of Financial Embarrassment

Finally, some find a sufficient justification of theft in their own embarrassments, alleging that they are
overwhelmed with debt, which they cannot pay off otherwise than by theft. Such persons should be given to
understand that no debt presses more heavily upon all men than that which we mention each day in these words
of the Lord's Prayer: Forgive us our debts. Hence it is the height of folly to be willing to increase our debt to
God by new sin, in order to be able to pay our debts to men. It is much better to be consigned to prison than to
be cast into the eternal torments of hell; it is by far a greater evil to be condemned by the judgment of God, than
by that of man. Hence it becomes our duty to have recourse to the assistance and mercy of God from whom we
can obtain whatever we need.

There are also other excuses, which, however, the judicious and zealous pastor will not find it difficult to meet,
so that thus he may one day be blessed with a people who are followers of good works.




THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT : "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour"




Importance Of Instruction On This Commandment

The great utility, nay the necessity, of carefully explaining this Commandment, and of emphasising its
obligation, we learn from these words of St. James: If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;
and again, The tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire, what a great
wood it kindleth; and so on, to the same effect.

From these words we learn two truths. The first is that sins of the tongue are very prevalent, which is confirmed
by these words of the Prophet: Every man is a liar, so that it would almost seem as if this were the only sin
which extends to all mankind. The other truth is that the tongue is the source of innumerable evils. Through the


                                                        271
fault of the evil-speaker are often lost the property, the reputation, the life, and the salvation of the Injured
person, or of him who inflicts the injury. The injured person, unable to bear patiently the contumely, avenges it
without restraint. The offender, on the other hand, deterred by a perverse shame and a false idea of what is
called honour, cannot be induced to make reparation to him whom he has offended.




This Commandment Should Call Forth Our Gratitude

Hence the faithful are to be exhorted to thank God as much as they can for having given this salutary
Commandment, not to bear false witness, which not only forbids us to injure others, but which also, if duly
observed, prevents others from injuring us.




Two Parts Of This Commandment

In its explanation we shall proceed as we have done with regard to the others, pointing out that in it are
contained two laws. The first forbids us to bear false witness. The other commands us to lay aside all
dissimulation and deceit, and to measure our words and actions by the standard of truth, a duty of which the
Apostle admonishes the Ephesians in these words: Doing the truth in charity, let us grow up in all things in him.




Negative Part Of This Commandment

With regard to the prohibitory part of this Commandment, although by false testimony is understood whatever
is positively but falsely affirmed of anyone, be it for or against him, be it in a public court or elsewhere; yet the
Commandment specially prohibits that species of false testimony which is given on oath in a court of justice.
For a witness swears by the Deity, because the words of a man thus giving evidence and using the divine name,
have very great weight and possess the strongest claim to credit. Such testimony, therefore, because it is
dangerous, is specially prohibited; for even the judge himself cannot reject the testimony of sworn witnesses,
unless they be excluded by exceptions made in the law, or unless their dishonesty and malice are notorious. This
is especially true since it is commanded by divine authority that in the mouth of two or three every word shall
stand.




"Against Thy Neighbour"

In order that the faithful may have a clear comprehension of this Commandment it should be explained who is
our neighbour, against whom it is unlawful to bear false witness. According to the interpretation of Christ the
Lord, our neighbour is he who needs our assistance, whether bound to us by ties of kindred or not, whether a
fellow-citizen or a stranger, a friend or an enemy.' It is wrong to think that one may give false evidence against
an enemy, since by the command of God and of our Lord we are bound to love him.

Moreover, as every man is bound to love himself, and is thus, in some sense, his own neighbour, it is unlawful
for anyone to bear false witness against himself. He who does so brands himself with infamy and disgrace, and
injures both himself and the Church of which he is a member, much as the suicide, by his act, does a wrong to
the state. This is the doctrine of St. Augustine, who says: To those who do not understand (the precept)
properly, it might seem lawful to give false testimony against one's self, because the words "against thy
neighbour" are subjoined in the Commandment. But let no one who bears false testimony against himself think




                                                        272
that he has not violated this Commandment, for the standard of loving our neighbour is the love which we
cherish towards ourselves.




False Testimony In Favour Of A Neighbour Is Also Forbidden

But if we are forbidden to injure our neighbour by false testimony, let it not be inferred that the contrary is
lawful, and that we may help by perjury those who are bound to us by ties of kinship or religion. It is never
allowed to have recourse to lies or deception, much less to perjury. Hence St. Augustine in his book to
Crescentius On Lying teaches from the words of the Apostle that a lie, although uttered in false praise of
anyone, is to be numbered among false testimonies. Treating of that passage, Yea, and we are found false
witnesses of God, because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ whom he hath
not raised, if the dead rise not again, he says: The Apostle calls it false testimony to utter a lie with regard to
Christ, even though it should seem to redound to His praise.

It also not infrequently happens, that by favouring one party we injure the other. False testimony is certainly the
occasion of misleading the judge, who, yielding to such evidence, is sometimes obliged to decide against
justice, to the injury of the innocent.

Sometimes, too, it happens that the successful party, who by means of perjured witnesses, has gained his case
and escaped with impunity, exulting in his iniquitous victory, soon becomes accustomed to the work of
corrupting and suborning false witnesses, by whose aid he hopes to obtain whatever he wishes.

To the witness himself it must be most grievous that his falsehood and perjury are known to him whom he has
aided and abetted by his perjury; whilst encouraged by the success that follows his crime, he becomes every day
more accustomed to wickedness and audacity.




"Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness"




All Falsehoods In Lawsuits Are Forbidden

This precept then prohibits deceit, lying and perjury on the part of witnesses. The same prohibition extends also
to plaintiffs, defendants, promoters, representatives, procurators and advocates; in a word, to all who take any
part in lawsuits.




False Testimony Out Of Court Is Forbidden

Finally, God prohibits all testimony which may inflict injury or injustice, whether it be a matter of legal
evidence or not. In the passage of Leviticus where the Commandments are repeated, we read: Thou shalt not
steal; thou shalt not lie; neither shall any man deceive his neighbour.' To none, therefore can it be a matter of
doubt, that this Commandment condemns lies of every sort, as these words of David explicitly declare: Thou
wilt destroy all that speak a lie.




                                                         273
This Commandment Forbids Detraction

This Commandment forbids not only false testimony, but also the detestable vice and practice of detraction, -- a
pestilence, which is the source of innumerable and calamitous evils. This vicious habit of secretly reviling and
calumniating character is frequently reprobated in the Sacred Scriptures. With him, says David, I would not eat;
and St. James: Detract not one another, my brethren.

Holy Writ abounds not only with precepts on the subject, but also with examples which reveal the enormity of
the crime. Aman, by a crime of his own invention, had so incensed Assuerus against the Jews that he ordered
the destruction of the entire race. Sacred history contains many other examples of the same kind, which priests
should recall in order to deter the people from such iniquity.




Various Kinds Of Detraction

But, to understand well the nature of this sin of detraction, we must know that reputation is injured not only by
calumniating the character, but also by exaggerating the faults of others. He who gives publicity to the secret sin
of any man, in an unnecessary place or time, or before persons who have no right to know, is also rightly
regarded as a detractor and evil-speaker, if his revelation seriously injures the other's reputation.

But of all sorts of calumnies the worst is that which is directed against Catholic doctrine and its teachers.
Persons who extol the propagators of error and of unsound doctrine are guilty of a like crime.

Nor are those to be dissociated from the ranks of evil-speakers, or from their guilt, who, instead of reproving,
lend a willing ear and a cheerful assent to the calumniator and reviler. As we read in St. Jerome and St. Bernard,
it is not so easy to decide which is more guilty, the detractor, or the listener; for if there were no listeners, there
would be no detractors.

To the same category belong those who cunningly foment divisions and excite quarrels; who feel a malignant
pleasure in sowing discord, dissevering by fiction and falsehood the closest friendships and the dearest social
ties, impelling to endless hatred and deadly combat the fondest friends. Of such pestilent characters the Lord
expresses His detestation in these words: Thou shalt not be a detractor nor a whisperer among the people. Of
this description were many of the advisers of Saul, who strove to alienate the king's affection from David and to
arouse his enmity against him.




This Commandment Forbids Flattery

Among the transgressors of this Commandment are to be numbered those fawners and sycophants who, by
flattery and insincere praise, gain the hearing and good will of those whose favour, money, and honours they
seek, calling good evil, and evil good, as the Prophet says. Such characters David admonishes us to repel and
banish from our society. The just man, he says, shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me; but let not the
oil of the sinner fatten my head. This class of persons do not, it is true, speak ill of their neighbour; but they
greatly injure him, since by praising his sins they cause him to continue in vice to the end of his life.

Of this species of flattery the most pernicious is that which proposes to itself for object the injury and the ruin of
others. Thus Saul, when he sought to expose David to the sword and fury of the Philistines, in order to bring
about his death, ad dressed him in these soothing words: Behold my eldest daughter Merob, her will I give thee
to wife: only be a valiant man and fight the battles of the Lord. In the same way the Jews thus insidiously
addressed our Lord: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth.




                                                         274
Still more pernicious is the language addressed sometimes by friends and relations to a person suffering with a
mortal disease, and on the point of death, when they assure him that there is no danger of dying, telling him to
be of good spirits, dissuading him from confession, as though the very thought should fill him with melancholy,
and finally withdrawing his attention from all care and thought of the dangers which beset him in the last
perilous hour.




This Commandment Forbids Lies Of All Kinds

In a word, lies of every sort are prohibited, especially those that cause grave injury to anyone, while most
impious of all is a lie uttered against or regarding religion.

God is also grievously offended by those attacks and slanders which are termed lampoons, and other
defamatory publications of this kind.

To deceive by a jocose or officious lie, even though it helps or harms no one, is, notwithstanding, altogether
unworthy; for thus the Apostle admonishes us: Putting away lying, speak ye the truth. This practice begets a
strong tendency to frequent and serious lying, and from jocose lying men contract the habit of lying, lose all
reputation for truth, and ultimately find it necessary, in order to gain belief, to have recourse to continual
swearing.




This Commandment Forbids Hypocrisy

Finally, the first part of this Commandment prohibits dissimulation. It is sinful not only to speak, but to act
deceitfully. Actions, as well as words, are signs of what is in our mind; and hence our Lord, rebuking the
Pharisees, frequently calls them hypocrites. So, far with regard to the negative, which is the first part of this
Commandment.




Positive Part of this Commandment




Judges Must Pass Sentence According To Law And Justice

We now come to explain what the Lord commands in the second part. Its nature and purpose require that trials
be conducted on principles of strict justice and according to law. It requires that no one usurp judicial powers or
authority, for, as the Apostle writes, it were unjust to judge another man's servant.

Again it requires that no one pass sentence without a sufficient knowledge of the case. This was the sin of the
priests and scribes who passed judgment on St. Stephen. The magistrates of Philippi furnish another example.
They have beaten us publicly, says the Apostle, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into
prison; and now do they thrust us out privately.

This Commandment also requires that the innocent be not condemned, nor the guilty acquitted; and that (the
decision) be not influenced by money, or favour, hatred or love. For so Moses admonished the elders whom he
had constituted judges of the people: Judge that which is just, whether he be one of your country or a stranger.
There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great; neither shall you respect
any man's person, because it is the judgment of God.


                                                        275
Witnesses Must Give Testimony Truthfully

With regard to an accused person who is conscious of his own guilt, God commands him to confess the truth, if
he is interrogated judicially. By that confession he, in some sort, bears witness to, and proclaims the praise and
glory of God; and of this we have a proof in these words of Josue, when exhorting Achan to confess the truth:
My son, give glory to the Lord the God of Israel.

But as this Commandment chiefly concerns witnesses, the pastor should give them special attention. The spirit
of the precept not only prohibits false testimony, but also commands the truth to be told. In human affairs, to
bear testimony to the truth is a matter of the highest importance, because there are innumerable things of which
we must be ignorant unless we arrive at a knowledge of them on the faith of witnesses. In matters with which
we are not personally acquainted and which we need to know, there is nothing so important as true evidence.
Hence the words of St. Augustine: He who conceals the truth and he who utters falsehood are both guilty; the
one, because he is unwilling to render a service; the other, because he has the will to do an injury.

We are not, however, at all times, obliged to disclose the truth; but when, in a court of justice, a witness is
legally interrogated by the judge, he is emphatically bound to tell the whole truth. Here, however, witnesses
should be most circumspect, lest, trusting too much to memory, they affirm for certain what they have not fully
ascertained.




Lawyers And Plaintiffs Must Be Guided By Love Of Justice

Attorneys and counsel, plaintiffs and prosecutors, remain still to be treated of. The two former should not refuse
to contribute their services and legal assistance, when the necessities of others call for their aid. They should
deal generously with the poor. They should not defend an unjust cause, prolong lawsuits by trickery, nor
encourage them for the sake of gain. As to remuneration for their services and labours, let them be guided by
the principles of justice and of equity.

Plaintiffs and prosecutors, on their side, are to be warned not to be led by the influence of love, or hatred, or any
other undue motive into exposing anyone to danger through unjust charges:




All Must Speak Truthfully And With Charity

To all conscientious persons is addressed the divine command that in all their intercourse with society, in every
conversation, they should speak the truth at all times from the sincerity of their hearts; that they should utter
nothing injurious to the reputation of another, not even of those by whom they know they have been injured and
persecuted. For they should always remember that between them and others there exists such a close social
bond that they are all members of the same body.




Inducements To Truthfulness

In order that the faithful may be more disposed to avoid the vice of lying, the pastor should place before them
the extreme lowness and disgrace of this sin. In the Sacred Scriptures the devil is called the father of lies; for as,
he stood not in the truth, he is a liar and the father thereof.




                                                         276
To banish so great a sin, (the pastor) should add the mischievous consequences of lying; but since they are
innumerable, he must be content with pointing out the chief kinds of these evils and calamities.

In the first place, he should show how grievously lies and deceit offend God and how deeply they are hated by
God. This he should prove from the words of Solomon: Six things there are which the Lord hateth, and the
seventh his soul detesteth: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that deviseth
wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief, a deceitful witness that uttereth lies, etc. Who, then, can
protect or save from severest chastisements the man who is thus the object of God's special hate?

Again, what more wicked, what more base than, as St. James says, with the same tongue, by which we bless
God and the Father, to curse men, who are made after the image and likeness of God, so that out of the same
fountain flows sweet and bitter water. The tongue, which was before employed in giving praise and glory to
God, afterwards, as far as it is able, by lying treats Him with ignominy and dishonour. Hence liars are excluded
from a participation in the bliss of heaven. To David asking, Lord! who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? the Holy
Spirit answers: He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue.

Lying is also attended with this very great evil that it is an almost incurable disease. For since the guilt of the
calumniator cannot be pardoned, unless satisfaction be made to the calumniated person, and since, as we have
already observed, this duty is difficult for those who are deterred from its performance by false shame and a
foolish idea of dignity, we cannot doubt that he who continues in this sin is destined to the unending
punishments of hell. Let no one indulge the hope of obtaining the pardon of his calumnies or detractions, until
he has repaired the injury which they have inflicted on the honour or fame of another, whether this was done in
a court of justice, or in private and familiar conversation.

But the evil consequences of lying are widespread and extend to society at large. By duplicity and lying, good
faith and truth, which form the closest links of human society, are dissolved, confusion ensues, and men seem to
differ in nothing from demons.




How To Avoid Lying

The pastor should also teach that loquacity is to be avoided. By avoiding loquacity other evils will be obviated,
and a great preventive opposed to lying, from which loquacious persons can scarcely abstain.




Excuses for Lying Refuted




The Plea Of Prudence

There are those who seek to justify their duplicity either by the unimportance of what they say, or by the
example of the worldly wise who, they claim, lie at the proper time. The pastor should correct such erroneous
ideas by answering what is most true, namely, that the wisdom of the flesh is death. He should exhort his
listeners in all their difficulties and dangers to trust in God, not in the artifice of lying; for those who have
recourse to subterfuge, plainly show that they trust more to their own prudence than to the providence of God.




The Plea Of Revenge




                                                        277
Those who lay the blame of their own falsehood on others, who first deceived them by lies, are to be taught the
unlawfulness of avenging their own wrongs, and that evil is not to be rendered for evil, but rather that evil is to
be overcome by good. Even if it were lawful to return evil for evil, it would not be to- our interest to harm
ourselves in order to get revenge. The man who seeks revenge by uttering falsehood inflicts very serious injury
on himself.




The Pleas Of Frailty, Habit, And Bad. Example

Those who plead human frailty are to be taught that it is a duty of religion to implore the divine assistance, and
not to yield to human infirmity.

Those who excuse themselves by habit are to be admonished to endeavour to acquire the contrary habit of
speaking the truth; particularly as those who sin habitually are more guilty than others.

There are some who adduce in their own justification the example of others, who, they contend, constantly
indulge in falsehood and perjury. Such persons should be undeceived by reminding them that bad men are not
to be imitated, but reproved and corrected; and that, when we ourselves are addicted to the same vice, our
admonitions have less influence in reprehending and correcting it in others.




The Pleas Of Convenience, Amusement, And Advantage

With regard to those who defend their conduct by saying that to speak the truth is often attended with
inconvenience, priests should answer that (such an excuse) is an accusation, not a defence, since it is the duty of
a Christian to suffer any inconvenience rather than utter a falsehood.

There remain two other classes of persons who seek to justify lying: those who say that they tell lies for the sake
of amusement, and those who plead motives of interest, claiming that without recourse to lies, they can neither
buy nor sell to advantage. The pastor should endeavour to reform both these kinds of liars. He should correct
the former by showing how strong a habit of sinning is contracted by their practice, and by strongly impressing
upon them the truth that for every idle word they shall render an account. As for the second class, he should
upbraid them with greater severity, because their very excuse is a most serious accusation against themselves,
since they show thereby that they yield no faith or confidence to these words of God: Seek first the kingdom of
God and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.




THE NINTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS : "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: neither
shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his hand-maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that
is his."




Importance Of Instruction On These Two Commandments

It is to be observed, in the first place, that these two precepts, which were delivered last in order, furnish a
general principle for the observance of all the rest. What is commanded in these two amounts to this, that if we
wish to observe the preceding precepts of the law, we must be particularly careful not to covet. For he who does
not covet, being content with what he has, will not desire what belongs to others, but will rejoice in their
prosperity, will give glory to the immortal God, will render Him boundless thanks, and will observe the


                                                        278
Sabbath, that is, will enjoy perpetual repose, and will respect his superiors. In fine, he will injure no man in
word or deed or otherwise; for the root of all evil is concupiscence, which hurries its unhappy victims into every
species of crime and wickedness. Keeping these considerations in mind, the pastor should be more diligent in
explaining this Commandment, and the faithful more ready to hear (his instruction).




Why These Two Commandments Are Explained Here Together

We have united these two Commandments because, since their subject-matter is similar, they may be treated
together. However, the pastor may explain them either together or separately, according as he may deem it more
effective for his exhortations and admonitions. If, however, he has undertaken the exposition of the Decalogue,
he should point out in what these two Commandments are dissimilar; how one covetousness differs from
another -- a difference noticed by St. Augustine, in his book of Questions on Exodus. The one covetousness
looks only to utility and interest, the other to unlawful desire and criminal pleasure. He, for instance, who covets
a field or house, pursues profit rather than pleasure, while he who covets another man's wife yields to a desire of
pleasure, not of profit.




Necessity Of Promulgating These Two Commandments

The promulgation of these two Commandments was necessary for two reasons. The first is to explain the sixth
and seventh Commandments. Reason alone shows that to prohibit adultery is also to prohibit the desire of
another man's wife, because, were the desire lawful, its indulgence must be so too; nevertheless, many of the
Jews, blinded by sin, could not be induced to believe that such desires were prohibited by God. Nay, even after
the Law had been promulgated and become known, many who professed themselves its interpreters, continued
in the same error, as we learn from these words of our Lord recorded in St. Matthew: You have heard that it was
said to them of old: "Thou shalt not commit adultery," but I say to you, etc.

The second reason (for the promulgation) of these two Commandments is that they distinctly and in express
terms prohibit some things of which the sixth and seventh Commandments do not contain an explicit
prohibition. The seventh Commandment, for instance, forbids an unjust desire or endeavour to take what
belongs to another; but this Commandment further prohibits even to covet it in any way, even though it could be
acquired justly and lawfully, if we foresee that by such acquisition our neighbour would suffer some loss.




These Two Commandments Teach God's Love For Us And Our Need Of Him

But before we come to the exposition of the Commandments, the faithful are first to be informed that by this
law we are taught not only to restrain our inordinate desires, but also to know the boundless love of God
towards us.

By the preceding Commandments God had, as it were, fenced us round with safeguards, securing us and ours
against injury of every sort; but by the addition of these two Commandments, He intended chiefly to provide
against the injuries which we might inflict on ourselves by the indulgence of inordinate desires, as would easily
happen were we at liberty to covet all things indiscriminately. By this law then, which forbids to covet, God has
blunted in some degree the keenness of desire, which excites to every kind of evil, so that by reason of His
command these desires are to some extent diminished, and we ourselves, freed from the annoying importunity
of the passions, are enabled to devote more time to the performance of the numerous and important duties of
piety and religion which we owe to God.




                                                       279
Nor is this the only lesson of instruction which we derive from these Commandments. They also teach us that
the divine law is to be observed not only by the external performance of duties, but also by the internal
concurrence of the heart. Between divine and human laws, then, there is this difference, that human laws are
fulfilled by an external compliance alone, whereas the laws of God, since He reads the heart, require purity of
heart, sincere and undefiled integrity of soul.

The law of God, therefore, is a sort of mirror, in which we behold the corruption of our own nature; and hence
these words of the Apostle: I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: "Thou shalt not covet." '
Concupiscence, which is the fuel of sin, and which originated in sin, is always inherent in our fallen nature;
from it we know that we are born in sin, and, therefore, do we humbly fly for assistance to Him, who alone can
efface the stains of sin.




Two Parts Of These Commandments

In common with the other Commandments, however, these two are partly mandatory, partly prohibitory.




Negative Part




"Thou Shalt Not Covet"

With regard to the prohibitory part, the pastor should explain what sort of concupiscence is prohibited by this
law, lest some may think that which is not sinful to be sinful.




What Sort Of Concupiscence Is Not Forbidden

Such is the concupiscence of the spirit against the flesh; Or that which David so earnestly desired, namely, to
long after the justifications of God at all times.

Concupiscence, then, is a certain commotion and impulse of the soul, urging men to the desire of pleasures,
which they do not actually enjoy. As the other propensities of the soul are not always sinful, neither is the
impulse of concupiscence always vicious. It is not, for instance, sinful to desire food and drink; when cold, to
wish for warmth; when warm, to wish to become cool. This lawful species of concupiscence was implanted in
us by the Author of nature; but in consequence of the sin of our first parents it passed the limits prescribed by
nature and became so depraved that it frequently excites to the desire of those things which conflict with the
spirit and reason.

However, if well regulated, and kept within proper bounds, it is often still the source of no slight advantage. In
the first place, it leads us to supplicate God continually, and humbly to beg of Him those things which we most
earnestly desire. Prayer is the interpreter of our wishes; and if this lawful concupiscence did not exist within us,
prayer would be far less frequent in the Church of God. It also makes us esteem the gifts of God more highly;
for the more eagerly we desire anything, the dearer and more pleasing will be its possession to us. Finally, the
gratification which we receive from the acquisition of the desired object increases the devotion of our gratitude
to God.




                                                        280
If then it is sometimes lawful to covet, it must be conceded that not every species of concupiscence is forbidden.
St. Paul, it is true, says that concupiscence is sin; but his words are to be understood in the same sense as those
of Moses, whom he cites, as the Apostle himself declares when, in his Epistle to the Galatians he calls it the
concupiscence of the flesh for he says: Walk in the -spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.

Hence that natural, well-regulated concupiscence which does not go beyond its proper limits, is not prohibited;
still less do these Commandments forbid that spiritual desire of the virtuous mind, which prompts us to long for
those things that war against the flesh, for the Sacred Scriptures themselves exhort us to such a desire: Covet ye
my words, Come over to me all ye that desire me.




What Sort Of Concupiscence Is Here Prohibited

It is not, then, the mere power of desire, which can move either to a good or a bad object that is prohibited by
these Commandments; it is the indulgence of evil desire, which is called the concupiscence of the flesh, and the
fuel of sin, and which when accompanied by the consent of the will, is always sinful. Therefore only that
covetousness is forbidden which the Apostle calls the concupiscence of the flesh, that is to say, those motions of
desire which are contrary to the dictates of reason and outstep the limits prescribed by God.




Two Kinds Of Sinful Concupiscence

This kind of covetousness is condemned, either because it desires what is evil, such as adultery, drunkenness,
murder, and such heinous crimes, of which the Apostle says: Let us not covet evil things, as they also coveted;
or because, although the objects may not be bad in themselves, yet there is some other reason which makes it
wrong to desire them, as when, for instance, God or His Church prohibit their possession; for it is not permitted
us to desire these things which it is altogether unlawful to possess. Such were, in the Old Law, the gold and
silver from which idols were made, and which the Lord in Deuteronomy forbade anyone to covet

Another reason why this sort of vicious desire is condemned is that it has for its object that which belongs to
another, such as a house, maid-servant, field, wife, ox, ass and many other things, all of which the law of God
forbids us to covet, simply because they belong to another. The desire of such things, when consented to, is
criminal, and is numbered among the most grievous sins. For sin is committed the moment the soul, yielding to
the impulse of corrupt desires, is pleased with evil things, and either consents to, or does not resist them, as St.
James, pointing out the beginning and progress of sin, teaches when he says: Every man is tempted by his own
concupiscence, being drawn away and allured; then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin;
but sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.

When, therefore, the Law says: Thou shalt not covet, it means that we are not to desire those things which
belong to others. A thirst for what belongs to others is intense and insatiable; for it is written: A covetous man
shall not be satisfied with money; and of such a one Isaias says: Woe to you that join house to house, and lay
field to field.




The Various Objects We Are Forbidden To Covet

But a distinct explanation of each of the words (in which this Commandment is expressed) will make it easier to
understand the deformity and grievousness of this sin.




                                                        281
Thy Neighbour’s House

The pastor, therefore, should teach that by the word house is to be understood not only the habitation in which
we dwell, but all our property, as we know from the usage and custom of the sacred writers. Thus when it is
said in Exodus that the Lord built houses for the midwives, the meaning is that He improved their condition and
means.

From this interpretation, therefore, we perceive, that we are forbidden to indulge an eager desire of riches, or to
envy others their wealth, or power, or rank; but, on the contrary, we are directed to be content with our own
condition, whether it be high or low. Furthermore, it is forbidden to desire the glory of others since glory also is
comprised under the word house.




"Nor His Ox, Nor His Ass'

The words that follow, nor his ox, nor his ass, teach us that not only is it unlawful to desire things of greater
value, such as a house, rank, glory, because they belong to others; but also things of little value, whatever they
may be, animate or inanimate.




"Nor His Servant

The words, nor his servant, come next, and include captives as well as other slaves whom it is no more lawful to
covet than the other property of our neighbour. With regard to the free who serve voluntarily either for wages,
or out of affection or respect, it is unlawful, by words, or hopes, or promises, or rewards to bribe or solicit them,
under any pretext whatever, to leave those to whose service they have freely engaged themselves; nay more, if,
before the period of their contract has expired, they leave their employers, they are to be admonished, on the
authority of this Commandment, to return to them by all means.




"Thy Neighbour's"

The word neighbour is mentioned in this Commandment to mark the wickedness of those who habitually covet
the lands, houses and the like, which lie in their immediate vicinity; for neighbourhood, which should make for
friendship, is transformed by covetousness from a source of love into a cause of hatred.




Goods For Sale Not Included Under This Prohibition

But this Commandment is by no means transgressed by those who desire to purchase or have actually
purchased, at a fair price, from a neighbour, the goods which he has for sale. Instead of doing him an injury,
they, on the contrary, very much assist their neighbour, because to him the money will be much more
convenient and useful than the goods he sells.




"His Wife"




                                                        282
The Commandment which forbids us to covet the goods of our neighbour, is followed by another, which forbids
us to covet our neighbour’s wife -- a law that prohibits not only the adulterer's criminal desire of his neighbour’s
wife, but even the wish to marry her. For of old when a bill of divorce was permitted, it might easily happen,
that she who was put away by one husband might be married to another. But the Lord forbade the desire of
another's wife lest husbands might be induced to abandon their wives, or wives conduct themselves with such
bad temper towards their husbands as to make it necessary to send them away.

But now this sin is more grievous because the wife, although separated from her husband, cannot be taken in
marriage by another until the husband's death. He, therefore, who covets another man's wife will easily fall from
this into another desire, for he will wish either the death of the husband or the commission of adultery.

The same principle holds good with regard to women who have been betrothed to another. To covet them is also
unlawful; and whoever strives to break their engagement violates one of the most holy of promises.

And if to covet the wedded wife of another is entirely unlawful, it is on no account right to desire in- marriage
the virgin who is consecrated to religion and to the service of God. But should anyone desire in marriage a
married woman whom he thinks to be single, and whom he would not wish to marry if he knew she had a
husband living, certainly he does not violate this Commandment. Pharaoh and Abimelech, as the Scripture
informs us, were betrayed into this error; they wished to marry Sarah, supposing her to be unmarried, and to be
the sister, not the wife of Abraham.




Positive Part




Detachment From Riches Enjoined

In order to make known the remedies calculated to overcome the vice of covetousness, the pastor should explain
the positive part of the Commandment, which consists in this, that if riches abound, we set not our hearts upon
them, that we be prepared to sacrifice them for the sake of piety and religion, that we contribute cheerfully
towards the relief of the poor, and that, if we ourselves are poor, we bear our poverty with patience and joy.
And, indeed, if we are generous with our own goods, we shall extinguish (in our own hearts) the desire of what
belongs to another.

Concerning the praises of poverty and the contempt of riches, the pastor will find little difficulty in collecting
abundant matter for the instruction of the faithful from the Sacred Scriptures and the works of the Fathers.




The Desire Of Heavenly And Spiritual Things Enjoined

Likewise this Commandment requires us to desire, with all the ardour and all the earnestness of our souls, the
consummation, not of our own wishes, but of the holy will of God, as it is expressed in the Lord's Prayer. Now
it is His will that we be made eminent in holiness; that we preserve our souls pure and undefiled; that we
practice those duties of mind and spirit which are opposed to sensuality; that we subdue our unruly appetites,
and enter, under the guidance of reason and of the spirit, upon a virtuous course of life; and finally that we hold
under restraint those senses in particular which supply matter to the passions.




Thoughts which Help one to Keep these Commandments


                                                        283
In order to extinguish the fire of passion, it will be found most efficacious to place before our eyes the evil
consequences of its indulgence.

Among those evils the first is that by obedience to the impulse of passion, sin gains uncontrolled sway over the
soul; hence the Apostle warns us: Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts
thereof. Just as resistance to the passions destroys the power of sin, so indulgence of the passions expels God
from His kingdom and introduces sin in His place.

Again, concupiscence, as St. James teaches, is the source from which flows very sin. Likewise St. John says:
All that is in the world is the concupiscence of the mesh, the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life.

A third evil of sensuality is that it darkens the understanding. Blinded by passion man comes to regard whatever
he desires as lawful and even laudable.

Finally, concupiscence stifles the seed of the divine word, sown in our souls by God, the great husband man.
Some, it is written in St. Mark, are sown among thorns; these are they who hear the word, and the cares of the
world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust after other things, entering in, choke the word, and it is made
fruitless.




Chief Ways in which These two Commandments are Violated

They who, more than others, are the slaves of concupiscence, the pastor should exhort with greater earnestness
to observe this Commandment. Such are the following: those who are addicted to improper amusements, or who
are immoderately given to recreation; merchants, who wish for scarcity, and who cannot bear that other buyers
or sellers hinder them from selling at a higher or buying at a lower rate; those who wish to see their neighbour
reduced to want in order that they themselves may profit in buying or selling; soldiers who thirst for war, in
order to enrich themselves with plunder; physicians, who wish for the spread of disease; lawyers, who are
anxious for a great number of-cases and litigations; and artisans who, through greed for gain, wish for a scarcity
of the necessaries of life in order that they may increase their profits.

They too, sin gravely against this Commandment, who, because they are envious of the praise and glory won by
others, strive to tarnish in some degree their fame, particularly if they themselves are idle and worthless
characters; for fame and glory are the reward of virtue and industry, not of indolence and laziness.




                                  PART IV : THE LORD'S PRAYER



PRAYER




Importance Of Instruction On Prayer

One of the duties of the pastoral office, which is of the highest importance to the spiritual interests of the
faithful, is to instruct them on Christian prayer; the nature and efficacy of which must remain unknown to many,
if not taught by the pious and faithful diligence of the pastor. To this, therefore, should the care of the pastor be
directed in a special manner, that his devout hearers may understand how and for what they are to ask God.



                                                        284
Whatever is necessary to the performance of the duty of prayer is comprised in that divine formula which Christ
the Lord deigned to make known to His Apostles, and through them and their successors to all Christians. Its
thoughts and words should be so deeply impressed on the mind and memory as to be ever in readiness. To assist
pastors, however, in teaching the faithful concerning this prayer, we have set down from those writers who are
conspicuous for learning and fullness in this matter, whatever appeared to us most suitable, leaving it to pastors
to draw upon the same sources for further information, should they deem it necessary.




Necessity of Prayer

In the first place the necessity of prayer should be insisted upon. Prayer is a duty not only recommended by way
of counsel, but also commanded by obligatory precept. Christ the Lord declared this when He said: We should
pray always. This necessity of prayer the Church points out in the prelude, if we may so call it, which she
prefixes to the Lord's Prayer: Admonished by salutary precepts, and taught by divine instruction, we presume to
say, etc.

Therefore, since prayer is necessary to the Christian, the Son of God, yielding to the request of the disciples,
Lord, teach us to pray, gave them a prescribed form of prayer, and encouraged them to hope that the objects of
their petitions would be granted. He Himself was to them a model of prayer; He not only prayed assiduously,
but watched whole nights in prayer.

The Apostles, also, did not omit to recommend this duty to those who had been converted to the faith of Jesus
Christ. St. Peter and St. John are most diligent in their admonitions to the devout; and the Apostle, mindful of its
nature, frequently admonishes Christians of the salutary necessity of prayer.

Besides, so various are our temporal and spiritual necessities, that we must have recourse to prayer as the best
means for communicating our wants and receiving whatever we need. For since God owes nothing to anyone,
we must ask of Him in prayer those things we need, seeing that He has constituted prayer as a necessary means
for the accomplishment of our desires, particularly since it is clear that there are blessings which we cannot
hope to obtain otherwise than through prayer. Thus devout prayer has such efficacy that it is a most powerful
means of casting out demons; for there is a certain kind of demon which is not cast out but by prayer and
fasting.

Those, therefore, who do not practice assiduous and regular prayer deprive themselves of a powerful means of
obtaining gifts of singular value. To succeed in obtaining the object of your desires, it is not enough that you ask
that which is good; your entreaties must also be assiduous. Every one that asketh, says St. Jerome, receiveth, as
it is written. If, therefore, it is not given you, this is because you do not ask. Ask, therefore, and you shall
receive.




The Fruits of Prayer

Moreover, this necessity of prayer is also productive of the greatest delight and usefulness, since it bears most
abundant fruits. When it is necessary to instruct the faithful concerning these fruits, pastors will find ample
matter in sacred writers. We have made from these sources a selection which appeared to us to suit the present
purpose.




Prayer Honours God




                                                       285
The first fruit which we receive is that by praying we honour God, since prayer is a certain act of religion,
which is compared in Scripture to a sweet perfume. Let my prayer, says the Prophet, be directed as incense in
thy sight. By prayer we confess our subjection to God; we acknowledge and proclaim Him to be the author of
all good, in whom alone we center all our hopes, who alone is our refuge, in all dangers and the bulwark of our
salvation. Of this fruit we are admonished also in these words: Call upon me in the day of trouble; I -will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.




Prayer Obtains What We Request

Another most pleasing and invaluable fruit of prayer is that it is heard by God. Prayer is the key of heaven, says
St. Augustine; prayer ascends, and the mercy of God descends. High as are the heavens, and low as is the earth,
God hears the voice of man. Such is the utility, such the efficacy of prayer, that through it we obtain a plenitude
of heavenly gifts. Thus by prayer we secure the guidance and aid of the Holy Spirit, the security and
preservation of the faith, deliverance from punishment, divine protection under temptation, victory over the
devil. In a word, there is in prayer an accumulation of spiritual joy; and hence our Lord said: Ask, and you shall
receive, that your joy may be full.




Proof

Nor can we, for a moment, doubt that God in His goodness awaits and is at all times ready to hear our petitions
-- a truth to which the Sacred Scriptures bear ample testimony. Since, however, the texts are easy of access, we
shall content ourselves with citing as an example the words of Isaias: Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will
hear: thou shalt cry, and he will say, "Here I am"; and again, It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
hear: as they are yet speaking, I will hear. With regard to instances of persons, who have obtained from God the
objects of their prayers, they are almost innumerable, and too well known to require special mention.




Unwise And Indevout Prayers Unheard

Sometimes, indeed, it happens that what we ask of God we do not obtain. But it is then especially that God
looks to our welfare, either because He bestows on us other gifts of higher value and in greater abundance, or
because what we ask, far from being necessary or useful, would prove superfluous and injurious. God, says St.
Augustine, denies some things in His mercy which He grants in His wrath.

Sometimes, also, such is the remissness and negligence with which we pray, that we ourselves do not attend to
what we say. Since prayer is an elevation of the soul to God, if, while we pray, the mind, instead of being fixed
upon God, is distracted, and the tongue slurs over the words at random, without attention, without devotion,
with what propriety can we give to such empty sounds the name of Christian prayer?

We should not, therefore, be at all surprised, if God does not comply with our requests; either because by our
negligence and indifference we almost show that we do not really desire what we ask, or because we ask those
things, which, if granted, would be prejudicial to our interests.




To Devout Prayer And Dispositions God Grants More Than Is Asked




                                                       286
On the other hand, to those who pray with devout attention, God grants more than they ask. This the Apostle
declares in his Epistle to the Ephesians, and the same truth is unfolded ill the parable of the prodigal son, who
would have deemed it a kindness to be admitted into the number of his father's servants.

Nay, God heaps His favours not only on those who seek them, but also on those who are rightly disposed; and
this, not only with abundance, but also with readiness. This is shown by the words of Scripture: The Lord hath
heard the desire of the poor. For God hastens to grant the inner and hidden desires of the needy without
awaiting their utterance.




Prayer Exercises And Increases Faith

Another fruit of prayer is, that it exercises and augments the virtues of the soul, particularly the virtue of faith.
As they who have not faith in God, cannot pray as they ought, for how can they call on him, whom they have
not believed ? so the faithful, in proportion to the fervour of their prayers, possess a stronger and a more assured
faith in the protecting providence of God, which requires principally that in all needs we have recourse to Him.




Prayer Strengthens Our Hope In God

God, it is true, might bestow on us all things abundantly, although we did not ask them or even think of them,
just as He bestows on the irrational creation all things necessary for the support of life. But our most bountiful
Father wishes to be invoked by His children; He wishes that, praying as we ought each day of our lives, we may
pray with increased confidence. He wishes that in obtaining our requests we may more and more bear witness to
and declare His goodness towards us.




Prayer Increases Charity

Our charity is also augmented. In recognising God as the author of every blessing and of every good, we are led
to cling to Him with the most devoted love. And as those who cherish a mutual affection become more ardently
attached by frequent interviews and conversations, so the oftener the soul prays devoutly and implores the
divine mercy, thus holding converse with God, the more exquisite is the sense of delight which she experiences
in each prayer, and the more ardently is she inflamed to love and adore Him.




Prayer Disposes The Soul For Divine Blessings

Furthermore, God wishes us to make use of prayer, in order that burning with the desire of asking what we are
anxious to obtain, we may thus by our perseverance and zeal make such advances in spiritual life, as to be
worthy to obtain those blessings which the soul could not obtain before because of its dryness and lack of
devotion.




Prayer Makes Us Realise Our Own Needfulness




                                                        287
Moreover, God wishes us to realise, and always keep in mind, that, unassisted by His heavenly grace, we can of
ourselves do nothing, and should therefore apply ourselves to prayer with all the powers of our souls.




Prayer Is A Protection Against The Devil

The weapons which prayer supplies are most powerful against our bitterest foes. With the cries of our prayers,
says St. Hilary, we must fight against the devil and his armed hosts.




Prayer Promotes A Virtuous Life

From prayer we also derive this important advantage that though we are inclined to evil and to the indulgence of
various passions, as a consequence of our natural frailty, God permits us to raise our hearts to Him, in order that
while we address Him in prayer, and endeavour to deserve His gifts, we may be inspired with a love of
innocence, and, by effacing our sins, be purified from every stain of guilt.




Prayer Disarms The Divine Vengeance

Finally, as St. Jerome observes, prayer disarms the anger of God. Hence, these words of God addressed to
Moses: Let me alone, when Moses sought by his prayer to stay the punishments God was about to inflict on His
people. Nothing is so efficacious in appeasing God, when His wrath is kindled; nothing so effectually delays or
averts the punishments prepared for the wicked as the prayers of men.




The Parts Of Prayer

The necessity and advantages of Christian prayer being explained, the faithful should also know how many, and
what are the parts of which it is composed; for that this pertains to the perfect discharge of this duty, we learn
from the Apostle. In his Epistle to Timothy, exhorting to pious and holy prayer, he carefully enumerates the
parts of which it consists: I desire therefore first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
thanksgivings be made for all men. Although the shades of distinction between these different parts of prayer
are delicate, yet the pastor, should he deem the explanation useful to his people, should consult, among others,
St. Hilary and St. Augustine.




The Two Chief Parts Of Prayer Petition And Thanksgiving

There are two principal parts of prayer, petition and thanksgiving, and since these are the sources, as it were,
from which all the others spring, they appear to us to be of too much importance to be omitted. For we approach
God and offer Him the tribute of our worship, either to obtain some favour, or to return Him thanks for those
with which His bounty every day enriches and adorns us. God Himself indicated both these most necessary
parts of prayer when He declared by the mouth of David: Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify me.




                                                       288
Who does not perceive how much we stand in need of the goodness and beneficence of God, if he but consider
the extreme destitution and misery of man?

On the other hand, all that have eyes and understanding know God's loving kindness toward man and the liberal
bounty He exercises in our behalf. Wherever we cast our eyes, wherever we turn our thoughts, the admirable
light of the divine goodness and beneficence beams upon us. What have we that is not the gift of His bounty? If,
then, all things are the gifts and favours bestowed on us by His goodness, why should not everyone, as much as
possible, celebrate the praises of God, and thank Him for His boundless beneficence.




Degrees Of Petition And Thanksgiving

Of these duties of petition and thanksgiving each contains many subordinate degrees. In order, therefore, that
the faithful may not only pray, but also pray in the best manner, the pastor should propose to them the most
perfect mode of praying, and should exhort them to use it to the best of their ability.




The Highest Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of The Just

What, then, is the best manner and the most exalted degree of prayer? It is that which is made use of by the
pious and the just. Resting on the solid foundation of the true faith, they rise successively from one degree of
prayer and virtue to another, until, at length, they reach that height of perfection, whence they can contemplate
the infinite power, goodness, and wisdom of God; where, too, they are animated with the assured hope of
obtaining not only those blessings which they desire in this life, but also those unutterable rewards which God
has pledged Himself to grant to him who piously and religiously implores His assistance.

Soaring, as it were, to heaven, on these two wings, the soul approaches, in fervent desire, the Divinity; adores
with supreme praise and thanksgiving Him from whom she has received such inestimable blessings; and, like an
only child, animated with singular piety and profound veneration, trustfully tells her most beloved Father all her
wants.

This sort of prayer the Sacred Scriptures express by the words pouring out. In his sight, says the Prophet, I pour
out my proyer, but before him I declare my trouble. This means that he who comes to pray should conceal or
omit nothing, but pour out all, flying with confidence into the bosom of God, his most loving Father. To this the
Sacred Scriptures exhort us in these words: Pour out thy heart before him, cast thy care upon the Lord. This is
that degree of prayer to which St. Augustine alludes when he says in that book entitled Enchiridion: What faith
believes, that hope and charity implore.




The Second Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of Sinners

Another degree of prayer is that of those who are weighed down by the guilt of mortal sin, but who strive, with
what is called dead faith, to raise themselves from their condition and to ascend to God. But, in consequence of
their languid state and the extreme weakness of their faith, they cannot raise themselves from the earth.
Recognising their crimes and stung with remorse of conscience, they bow themselves down with humility, and,
far as they are removed from God, implore of Him with penitential sorrow, the pardon of their sins and the
peace of reconciliation.

The prayers of such persons are not rejected by God, but are heard by Him. Nay, in His mercy, He generously
invites such as these to have recourse to Him, saying: Come to me, all you that labour, and are heavily laden,



                                                       289
and I will refresh you, of this class was the publican, who, though he did not dare to raise his eyes towards
heaven, left the Temple, as (our Lord) declares, more justified than the Pharisee.




The Third Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of Unbelievers

A third degree of prayer is that which is offered by those who have not as yet been illumined with the light of
faith; but who, when the divine goodness illumines in their souls the feeble natural light, are strongly moved to
the desire and pursuit of truth and most earnestly pray for a knowledge of it.

If they persevere in such dispositions, God, in His mercy, will not neglect their earnest endeavours, as we see
verified by the example of Cornelius the centurion. The doors of the divine mercy are closed against none who
sincerely ask for mercy.




The Lowest Degree Of Prayer: The Prayer Of The Impenitent

The last degree is that of those who not only do not repent of their sins and enormities, but, adding crime to
crime, dare frequently to ask pardon of God for those sins, in which they are resolved to continue. With such
dispositions they would not presume to ask pardon from their fellow-man.

The prayer of such sinners is not heard by God. It is recorded of Antiochus: Then this wicked man prayed to the
Lord, of whom he was not to obtain mercy. Whoever lives in this deplorable condition should be vehemently
exhorted to wean himself from all affection to sin, and to return to God in good earnest and from the heart.




What We Should Pray For

Under the head of each Petition we shall point out in its proper place, what is, and what is not a proper object of
prayer. Hence it will suffice here to remind the faithful in a general way that they ought to ask of God such
things as are just and good, lest, praying for what is not suitable, they may be repelled in these words: You
know not what you ask. Whatever it is lawful to desire, it is lawful to pray for, as is proved by the Lord's ample
promise: You shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you, words in which He promises to grant
all things.




Spiritual Goods

In the first place, then, the standard which should regulate all our wishes is that we desire above all else God,
the supreme Good. After God we should most desire those things which unite us most closely to Him; while
those which would separate us from Him, or occasion that separation, should have no share whatever in our
affections.




External Goods And Goods Of Body




                                                        290
Taking, then, as our standard the supreme and perfect Good, we can easily infer how we are to desire and ask
from God our Father those other things which are called goods. Goods which are called bodily, such as health,
strength, beauty and those which are external, such as riches, honours, glory, often supply the means and give
occasion for sin; and, therefore, it is not always either pious or salutary to ask for them. We should pray for
these goods of life only in so far as we need them, thus referring all to God. It cannot be deemed unlawful to
pray for those things for which Jacob and Solomon prayed. If, says Jacob, he shall give me bread to eat and
raiment to put on, the Lord shall be my God. Give me, says Solomon, only the necessaries of life.

But when we are supplied by the bounty of God with necessaries and comforts, we should not forget the
admonition of the Apostle: Let them that buy, be as if they possessed not, and those that use this world, as if
they used it not; for the figure of this world passeth away; and again, If riches abound, set not your heart upon
them. God Himself teaches us that only the use and fruit of these things belong to us and that we are obliged to
share them with others. If we are blessed with health, if we abound in other external and corporal goods, we
should recollect that they are given to us in order to enable us to serve God with greater fidelity, and as the
means of lending assistance to others.




Goods Of The Mind

It is also lawful to pray for the goods and adornments of the mind, such as a knowledge of the arts and sciences,
provided our prayers are accompanied with this condition, that they serve to promote the glory of God and our
own salvation.

The only thing which can be absolutely and unconditionally the object of our wishes, our desires and our
prayers, is, as we have already observed, the glory of God, and, next to it, whatever can serve to unite us to that
supreme Good, such as faith and the fear and love of God, of which we shall treat at length when we come to
explain the Petitions.




For Whom We Ought to Pray

The objects of prayer being known, the faithful are next to be taught for whom they are to pray. Prayer
comprehends petition and thanksgiving. We shall first treat of petition.




The Prayer Of Petition Should Be Offered For All

We are to pray for all mankind, without exception of enemies, nation or religion; for every man, be he enemy,
stranger or infidel, is our neighbour, whom God commands us to love, and for whom, therefore, we should
discharge a duty of love, which is prayer. To the discharge of this duty the Apostle exhort: when he says: I
desire that prayer be made for all men. In such prayers we should first ask for those things that concern spiritual
interests, and next for what pertains to temporal welfare.




Those For Whom We Should Especially Offer Our Petitions: Pastors

Before all others the pastors of our souls have a right to our prayers, as we learn from the example of the
Apostle in his Epistle to the Colossians, in which he asks them to pray for him, that God may open unto him a
door of speech, a request which he also makes in his Epistle to the Thessalonians. In the Acts of the Apostles


                                                       291
we also read that prayers were offered in the Church without intermission for Peter. St. Basil, in his work On
Morals, urges to a faithful compliance with this obligation. We must, he says, pray for those who are charged
with preaching the word of truth.




Rulers Of Our Country

In the next place, as the same Apostle teaches, we should pray for our rulers.

Who does not know what a singular blessing a people enjoy in public officials who are just and upright? We
should, therefore, beseech God to make them such as they ought to be, fit persons to govern others.




The Just

To offer up our prayers also for the good and pious is a practice taught by the example of holy men. Even the
good and the pious need the prayers of others. Providence has wisely ordained it so, in order that the just,
realising the necessity they are under of being aided by the prayers of those who are inferior to them, may not
be inflated with pride.




Enemies And Those Outside The Church

The Lord has also commanded us, to pray for those that persecute and calumniate us. The practice of praying
for those who are not within the pale of the Church, is, as we know on the authority of St. Augustine, of
Apostolic origin. We pray that the faith may be made known to infidels; that idolaters may be rescued from the
error of their impiety; that the Jews, emerging from the darkness with which they are encompassed, may arrive
at the light of truth; that heretics, returning to soundness of mind, may be instructed in the Catholic faith; and
that schismatics may be united in the bond of true charity and may return to the communion of their holy
mother, the Church, from which they have separated.

Many examples prove that prayers for such as these are very efficacious when offered from the heart. Instances
occur every day in which God rescues individuals of every condition of life from the powers of darkness, and
transfers them into the kingdom of His Beloved Son, from vessels of wrath making them vessels of mercy. That
the prayers of the pious have very great influence in bringing about this result no one can reasonably doubt.




The Dead

Prayers for the dead, that they may be liberated from the fire of purgatory, are derived from Apostolic teaching.
But on this subject we have said enough when explaining the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.




Sinners




                                                       292
Those who are said to sin unto death derive little advantage from prayers and supplications. It is, however, the
part of Christian charity to offer up our prayers and tears for them, in order, if possible, to obtain their
reconciliation with God.

With regard to the execrations uttered by holy men against the wicked, it is certain, from the teaching of the
Fathers, that they are either prophecies of the evils which are to befall sinners or denunciations of the crimes of
which they are guilty, that the sinner may be saved, but sin destroyed.




The Prayer Of Thanksgiving Should Be Offered For All

In the second part of prayer we render most grateful thanks to God for the divine and immortal blessings which
He has always bestowed, and still continues to bestow every day on the human race.




Our Thanksgiving Should Especially Be Offered: For The Saints

This duty we discharge especially when we give singular praises to God for the victory and triumph which all
the Saints, aided by His goodness, have achieved over their domestic and external enemies.




For The Blessed Virgin Mary

To this sort of prayer belongs the first part of the Angelic Salutation, when used by us as a prayer: Hail Mary,
full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women. For in these words we render to God the
highest praise and return Him most gracious thanks, because He has bestowed all His heavenly gifts on the most
holy Virgin; and at the same time we congratulate the Virgin herself on her singular privileges.

To this form of thanksgiving the Church of God has wisely added prayers and an invocation addressed to the
most holy Mother of God, by which we piously and humbly fly to her patronage, in order that, by her
intercession, she may reconcile God to us sinners and may obtain for us those blessings which we stand in need
of in this life and in the life to come. We, therefore, exiled children of Eve, who dwell in this vale of tears,
should constantly beseech the Mother of mercy, the advocate of the faithful, to pray for us sinners. In this prayer
we should earnestly implore her help and assistance; for that she possesses exalted merits with God, and that
she is most desirous to assist us by her prayers, no one can doubt without impiety and wickedness.




To Whom We Should Pray




To God

That God is to be prayed to and His name invoked is the language of the law of nature, inscribed upon the
human heart. It is also the doctrine of Holy Scripture, in which we hear God commanding: Call upon me in the
day of trouble. By the word God, we mean the three Persons (of the adorable Trinity).




                                                        293
To The Saints

We must also have recourse to the intercession of the Saints who are in glory. That the Saints are to be prayed
to is a truth so firmly established in the Church of God, that no pious person can experience a shadow of doubt
on the subject. But as this point was explained in its proper place, under a separate head, we refer the pastor and
others to that place.




God And The Saints Addressed Differently

To remove, however, the possibility of error on the part of the unlearned it will be found useful to explain to the
faithful the difference between these two kinds of invocation.

We do not address God and the Saints in the same manner, for we implore God to grant us blessings or to
deliver us from evils; while we ask the Saints, since they are the friends of God, to take us under their patronage
and to obtain for us from God whatever we need. Hence we make use of two different forms of prayer. To God,
we properly say: Have mercy on us, Hear us; but to the Saints, Pray for us. Still we may also ask the Saints,
though in a different sense, that they have mercy on us, for they are most merciful. Thus we may beseech them
that, touched with the misery of our condition, they would interpose in our behalf their influence and
intercession before God.

In the performance of this duty, it is strictly incumbent on all not to transfer to any creature the right which
belongs exclusively to God. For instance, when we say the Our Father before the image of a Saint we should
bear in mind that we beg of the Saint to pray with us and to obtain for us those favours which we ask of God, in
the Petitions of the Lord's Prayer, -- in a word, that he become our interpreter and intercessor with God. That
this is an office which the Saints discharge, St. John the Apostle teaches in the Apocalypse.




Preparation for Prayer

In Scripture we read: Before prayer, prepare thy soul, and be not as a man that tempteth God. He tempts God
who prays well but acts badly, and while he converses with God allows his mind to wander.

Since, then, the dispositions with which we pray are of such vital importance, the pastor should teach his pious
hearers how to pray.




Humility

The first preparation, then, for prayer is an unfeigned humility of soul, an acknowledgment of our sinfulness,
and a conviction that, when we approach God in prayer, our sins render us undeserving, not only of receiving a
propitious hearing from Him, but even of appearing in His presence.

This preparation is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures: He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble, and
he hath not despised their petitions; the prayer of him that humbleth himself shall pierce the clouds. Many other
passages of the same kind will suggest themselves to learned pastors. Hence we abstain from citing more here.

Two examples, however, at which we have already glanced in another place, and which are apposite to our
purpose, we shall not pass over in silence. The publican, who, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his



                                                       294
eyes toward heaven, and the woman, a sinner, who, moved with sorrow, washed the feet of Christ the Lord,
with her tears, illustrate the great efficacy which Christian humility imparts to prayer.




Sorrow For Sin

The next (preparation) is a feeling of sorrow, arising from the recollection of our past sins, or, at least, some
sense of regret, that we do not experience that sorrow. If the sinner bring not with him to prayer both, or, at least
one of these dispositions, he cannot hope to obtain pardon.




Freedom From Violence, Anger, Hatred And Inhumanity

There are some crimes, such as violence and murder, which are in a special way obstacles to the efficacy of our
prayers, and we must, therefore, preserve our hands unstained by outrage and cruelty. Of such crimes the Lord
says by the mouth of Isaias: When you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you; and when
you multiply prayer, I will not hear, for your hands are full of blood

Anger and strife we should also avoid, for they have great influence in preventing our prayers from being heard.
Concerning them the Apostle says: l will that men pray in every place lifting up pure hands, without anger and
contention.

Implacable hatred of any person on account of injuries received we must guard against; for while we are under
the influence of such feelings,- it is impossible that we should obtain from God the pardon of our sins. When
you shall stand to pray, He says, forgive, if you have aught against any man; and, if you will not forgive men,
neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your offences.

Hardness and inhumanity to the poor we should also avoid. For concerning men of this kind it was said He that
stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor, shall also cry himself, and shall not be heard.




Freedom From Pride And Contempt Of God's Word

What shall we say of pride? How much it offends God, we learn from these words: God resisteth the proud, and
giveth grace to the humble. What of the contempt of the divine oracles? He that turneth away his ears, says
Solomon, from hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination.

Here, however, we are not to understand that we are forbidden to pray for the forgiveness of the injuries we
have done, of murder, anger, insensibility to the wants of the poor, of pride, contempt of God's word, in fine, of
any other sin.




Faith And Confidence

Faith is another necessary quality for this preparation of soul. Without faith, we can have no knowledge of the
omnipotence or mercy of the supreme Father, which are the sources of our confidence in prayer, as Christ the
Lord Himself has taught: All things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive. St.
Augustine, speaking of this faith, thus comments on the Lord's words: Without faith prayer is useless.



                                                        295
The chief requisite, therefore, of a good prayer is, as we have already said, a firm and unwavering faith. This the
Apostle shows by an antithesis: How shall they call on him whom they have not believed? Believe, then, we
must, both in order to pray, and that we be not wanting in that faith which renders prayer fruitful. For it is faith
that leads to prayer, and it is prayer that, by removing all doubts, gives strength and firmness to faith. This is the
meaning of the exhortation of St. Ignatius to those who would approach God in prayer: Be not of doubtful mind
in prayer; blessed is he who hath not doubted. Wherefore, to obtain from God what we ask, faith and an assured
confidence, are of first importance, according to the admonition of St. James: Let him ask in faith, nothing
wavering.




Motives Of Confidence In Prayer

There is much to inspire us with confidence in prayer. Among these are to be numbered the beneficence and
bounty of God, displayed towards us, when He commands us to call Him Father, thus giving us to understand
that we are His children. Again there are the numberless instances of those whose prayers have been heard.

Further we have as our chief advocate, Christ the Lord, who is ever ready to assist us, as we read in St. John: If
any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just; and he is the propitiation for our sins.'
In like manner Paul the Apostle says: Christ Jesus, that died, yea, that is risen also again, who is at the right
hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. To Timothy he writes: For there is one God, and one
mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus; and to the Hebrews he writes: Wherefore, it behoved him in all
things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest before God.
Unworthy, then, as we are, of obtaining our requests, yet considering and resting our claims upon the dignity of
our great Mediator and Intercessor, Jesus Christ, we should hope and trust most confidently, that, through His
merits, God will grant us all that we ask in the proper way.

Finally, the Holy Ghost is the author of our prayers; and under His guiding influence, we cannot fail to be
heard. We have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, "Abba, (Father)." This spirit succours
our infirmity and enlightens our ignorance in the discharge of the duty of prayer; nay, even, as the Apostle says,
He asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.

Should we, then, at any time waver, not being sufficiently strong in faith, let us say with the Apostles: Lord,
increase our faith; and, with the father (of the demoniac): Help my unbelief.




Correspondence With God's Will

But what most ensures the accomplishment of our desires is the union of faith and hope with that conformity of
all our thoughts, actions, and prayers to God's law and pleasure. If, He says, you abide in me, and my words
abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.




Fraternal Charity

In order, however, that our prayers may have this power of obtaining all things from God, we must, as was
previously served, forget injuries, cherish sentiments of good will, and practice kindness towards our neighbour.




How to Pray Well


                                                        296
The manner of praying is also a matter of the highest moment. Though prayer in itself is good and salutary, yet
if not performed in a proper manner it is unavailing. Often we do not obtain what we ask, because, in the words
of St. James, we ask amiss. Pastors, therefore, should instruct the faithful in the best manner of asking well and
of making private and public prayer. The rules of Christian prayer have been formed on the teaching of Christ
the Lord.




We Must Pray In Spirit And In Truth

We must, then pray in spirit and in truth; for the heavenly Father seeks those who adore Him in spirit and in
truth. He prays in this manner whose prayer proceeds from an interior and intense ardour of soul.




Mental Prayer

This spiritual manner of praying does not exclude the use of vocal prayer. Nevertheless, that prayer which is the
vehement outpouring of the soul, deservedly holds the first place; and although not uttered with the lips, it is
heard by God to whom the secrets of hearts are open. He heard the silent prayer of Anna, the mother of Samuel,
of whom we read, that she prayed, shedding many tears and only moving her lips. Such was also the prayer of
David, for he says: My heart hath said to thee, my f ace hath sought thee. In reading the Bible one will meet
many similar examples.




Vocal Prayer

But vocal prayer has also its advantages and necessity. It quickens the attention of the mind, and kindles the
fervour of him who prays. We sometimes, says St. Augustine, in his letter to Proba, animate ourselves to
intensify our holy desire by having recourse to words and other signs; filled with vehement ardour and piety, we
find it impossible at times not to express our feelings in words; for while the soul exults with joy, the tongue
should also give utterance to that exultation. And surely it becomes us to make to God this complete sacrifice of
soul and body, a kind of prayer which the Apostles were accustomed to use, as we learn from many passages of
the Acts and of the Apostle.




Private And Public Prayer

There are two sorts of prayer, private and public. Private prayer is employed in order to assist interior attention
and devotion; whereas in public prayer, which has been instituted to excite the piety of the faithful, and has
been prescribed for certain fixed times, the use of words is indispensably required.




Those Who Do Nor Pray In Spirit

This practice of praying in spirit is peculiar to Christians, and is not at all used by infidels. Of these Christ the
Lord has said: When you pray, speak not much, as the heathens; for they think that in their much speaking they
may be heard. Be not ye, therefore, like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you before you
ask him.



                                                        297
But though (our Lord) prohibits loquacity, He is so far from forbidding continuance in prayer which proceeds
from the eager and prolonged devotion of the soul that by His own example He exhorts us to such prayer. Not
only did He spend whole nights in prayer, but also prayed the third time, saying the self-same words. The
inference, therefore, to be drawn from the prohibition is that prayers consisting of mere empty sounds are not to
be addressed to God.




Those Who Do Not Pray In Truth

Neither do the prayers of the hypocrite proceed from the heart; and against the imitation of their example, Christ
the Lord warns us in these words: When ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites that love to stand and pray in
the synagogues, and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Amen I say, to you they have received
their reward. But thou, when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy
Father in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee. Here the word chamber may be understood
to mean the human heart, which we should not only enter, but should also close against every distraction from
without that could deprive our prayer of its perfection. For then will our heavenly Father, who sees perfectly our
hearts and secret thoughts, grant our petitions.




We Must Pray With Perseverance

Another necessary condition of prayer is constancy. The great efficacy of perseverance, the Son of God
exemplifies by the conduct of the judge, who, while he feared not God, nor regarded man, yet, overcome by the
persistence and importunity of the widow, yielded to her entreaties." In our prayers to God we should, therefore,
be persevering.

We must not imitate the example of those who become tired of praying, if, after having prayed once or twice,
they succeed not in obtaining the object of their prayers. We should never be weary of the duty of prayer, as we
are taught by the authority of Christ the Lord and of the Apostle. And should the will at any time fail us, we
should beg of God by prayer the strength to persevere.




We Must Pray In The Name Of Jesus Christ

The Son of God would also have us present our prayers to the Father in His name; for, by His merits and the
influence of His mediation, our prayers acquire such weight that they are heard by our heavenly Father. For He
Himself says in St. John: Amen, Amen, I say unto you, if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give
it you. Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name: ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full;
and again: Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do.




We Must Pray With Fervour, Uniting Petition To Thanksgiving

Let us imitate the fervour of the Saints in prayer; and to petition let us unite thanksgiving, imitating the example
of the Apostles, who, as may be seen in the Epistles of St. Paul, always observed this salutary practice.




Fasting And Almsdeeds Should Be Joined To Prayer


                                                        298
To prayer let us unite fasting and almsdeeds. Fasting is most intimately connected with prayer. For the mind of
one who is filled with food and drink is so borne down as not to be able to raise itself to the contemplation of
God, or even to understand what prayer means.

Almsdeeds have also an intimate connection with prayer. For what claim has he to the virtue of charity, who,
possessing the means of affording relief to those who depend on the assistance of others, refuses help to his
neighbour and brother ? How can he, whose heart is devoid of charity, demand assistance from God unless,
while imploring the pardon of his sins, he at the same time humbly beg of God to grant him the virtue of charity
?

This triple remedy was, therefore, appointed by God to aid man in the attainment of salvation. For by sin we
offend God, wrong our neighbour, or injure ourselves. The wrath of God we appease by pious prayer; our
offences against man we redeem by almsdeeds; the stains of our own lives we wash away by fasting. Each of
these remedies, it is true, is applicable to every sort of sin; they are, however, peculiarly adapted to those three
which we have specially mentioned.




                               OPENING WORDS OF THE LORD'S PRAYER

"Our Father who art in heaven"




Importance Of Instruction On These Words

The form of Christian prayer given us by Jesus Christ is so composed and arranged that before coming to
requests and petitions certain words must be used as a sort of preface calculated to increase our confidence in
God when we are about to address Him devoutly in prayer; and this being so it will be the pastor's duty to
explain each of these words separately and with precision, so that the faithful may have recourse to prayer more
readily because of the knowledge that they are going to commune and converse with a God who is also their
Father. Regarding this preface, if we merely consider the number of words of which it is composed, it is brief
indeed; but if we regard the ideas, it is of the greatest importance and replete with mysteries.




"Father"

The first word, which, by the order and institution of God we employ in this prayer, is Father. Our Saviour
could, indeed, have commenced this divine prayer with some other word, conveying more the idea of majesty,
such, for instance, as Lord or Creator. Yet He omitted all such expressions because they might rather inspire
fear, and instead of them He has chosen a term inspiring confidence and love in those who pray and ask
anything of God; for what is sweeter than the name Father, conveying, as it does, the idea of indulgence and
tenderness ? The reasons why this name Father is applicable to God, can be easily explained to the faithful by
speaking to them on the subjects of creation, providence, and redemption.




God Is Called Father Because He Created Us

Thus having created man to His own image -- a favour He accorded to no other living creature -- it is with good
reason that, in view of this unique privilege with which He has honoured man, Sacred Scripture calls God the
Father of all men; not only of the faithful, but also of the unbelieving.


                                                        299
God Is Called Father Because He Provides For Us

From His providence also may be drawn an argument. By a special superintending care and providence over our
interests God displays a paternal love for us.




God's Care For Us Is Seen In The Appointment Of Guardian Angels

But in order to comprehend more clearly the fatherly care of God for men, it will be well in the explanation of
this particular point to say something regarding the guardian Angels under whose protection men are placed.

By God's providence Angels have been entrusted with the office of guarding the human race and of
accompanying every human being so as to preserve him from any serious dangers. Just as parents, whose
children are about to travel a dangerous and infested road, appoint guardians and helpers for them, so also in the
journey we are making towards our heavenly country our heavenly Father has placed over each of us an Angel
under whose protection and vigilance we may be enabled to escape the snares secretly prepared by our enemy,
repel the dreadful attacks he makes on us, and under his guiding hand keep the right road, and thus be secure
against all false steps which the wiles of the evil one might cause us to make in order to draw us aside from the
path that leads to heaven.




How We Are Helped By The Angels

And the immense advantage springing from the special care and providence of God with regard to men, the
execution of which is entrusted to Angels, who by nature hold an intermediate place between God and man, will
be clear from a multitude of examples with which Sacred Scripture supplies us in abundance, and which show
that in God's goodness it has often happened that Angels have wrought wondrous works under the very eyes of
men. This gives us to understand that many and equally important services, which do not fall under our sight,
are wrought by our Angels, the guardians of our salvation, in our interest and for our advantage.

The Angel Raphael, the divinely appointed companion and guide of Tobias, conducted him and brought him
back safe and sound; saved him from being devoured by an enormous fish; made known to him the extremely
useful properties possessed by the liver, gall and heart of the monster; expelled the demon; repressed and
fettered his power and prevented him from injuring Tobias; taught the young man the true and legitimate notion
and use of matrimony; and finally restored to the elder Tobias the use of his sight.

In the same way the Angel who liberated the Prince of the Apostles, will supply copious material for the
instruction of the pious flock regarding the striking fruits of the vigilance and protection of the Angels. The
pastor need do no more than depict the Angel lighting up the darkness of the prison, touching Peter's side and
awakening him from his sleep, loosing his chains, breaking his bonds, ordering him to rise, to take up his
sandals and to follow; and then the pastor will point out how Peter was led forth out of prison by the same
Angel, how he was enabled to pass without let or hindrance through the midst of the guard, how the doors were
thrown open, and finally how he was placed in safety.

The historical part of Sacred Scripture, as we have already remarked, is full of such examples, all of which go to
show the extent of the benefits bestowed by God on man through the ministry and intervention of Angels whom
He deputes not only on particular and private occasions, but also appoints to take care of us from our very
births. He furthermore appoints them to watch over the salvation of each one of the human race.




                                                       300
This teaching, if carefully explained, will have the effect of interesting and compelling the minds of the faithful
to acknowledge and venerate more and more the paternal care and providence of God towards them.




God's Care For Us Seen In The Love He Has Ever Shown To Man

And here the pastor should especially praise and proclaim the treasures of God's goodness towards the human
race. Though from the time of our first parents and from the moment of our first sin down to this very day we
have offended Him by countless sins and crimes, yet He still retains His love for us and never renounces His
singular solicitude for our welfare.

To imagine that He has forgotten us would be an act of folly and nothing short of a most outrageous insult. God
was angry with the Israelites because of the blasphemy they had been guilty of in imagining that they had been
abandoned by providence. Thus do we read in Exodus: They tempted the Lord, saying: "Is the Lord amongst us
or not?" and in Ezechiel the divine anger is inflamed against the same people for having said: The Lord seeth us
not: the Lord hath forsaken the earth. These examples should suffice to deter the faithful from entertaining the
criminal notion that God can ever possibly forget mankind. To the same effect we may read in Isaias the
complaint uttered by the Israelite. against God; and, on the other hand, the kindly similitude with which God
refutes their folly: Sion said: "The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me." To which God
answers: Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to have pity on the son of her womb? And if she should
forget, yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have engraven thee in my hands.

Although these passages clearly establish the point under discussion, yet thoroughly to convince the faithful that
never for a moment can God forget man or cease to lavish on him tokens of His paternal tenderness, the pastor
should still further confirm this by the striking example of our first parents. They had ignored and violated
God's command. When you hear them sharply accused and that dreadful sentence of condemnation pronounced
against them: Cursed is the earth in thy work, with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life;
thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth; " when you see them
driven out of Paradise; when you read that to preclude all hope of their return a cherub was stationed at the
entrance of Paradise, brandishing a flaming sword turning every way; and finally, when you know that, to
avenge the injury done Him, God had afflicted them with punishments, internal and external, would you- not be
inclined to think that man's case was hopeless? Would you not consider that not only was he bereft of all divine
help, but was even abandoned to every misfortune? Yet, surrounded as he then was by so many evidences of
divine wrath and vengeance, a gleam of the goodness of God towards him is seen to shine forth. For the Lord
God, says Sacred Scripture, made for Adam and his wife garments of skins and clothed them, which was a very
clear proof that at no time would God abandon man.

This truth, that the love of God can be exhausted by no human iniquity, was indicated by David in these words:
Will God in his anger shut up his mercies? It was set forth by Habacuc when, addressing God, he said: When
thou art angry thou wilt remember mercy; and by Micheas, who thus expresses it: Who is a God like to thee
who takest away iniquity and passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance? He will send his fury in no
more, because he delighteth in mercy.

And thus precisely does it happen. At the very moment when we imagine ourselves to be utterly lost and
altogether bereft of His protection, then it is that God in His infinite goodness seeks us out in a special way and
takes care of us. Even in His anger He stays the sword of His justice, and ceases not to pour out the
inexhaustible treasures of His mercy.




God Is Called Father Because He Has Granted Us Redemption




                                                       301
The creation of the world and God's providence are, then, of great weight in bringing into relief the singular
love of God for the human race and the special care He takes of man. But far above these two shines the work
of redemption, so much so indeed that our most bountiful God and Father has crowned His infinite goodness
towards us by granting us this third favour.

Accordingly the pastor should instruct his spiritual children and constantly recall to their minds the surpassing
love of God for us, so that they may be fully alive to the fact that having been redeemed in a wonderful manner
they are thereby made the sons of God. To them, says St. John, He gave power to be made the sons of God . . .
and they are born of God.

This is why Baptism, the first pledge and token of our redemption, is called the Sacrament of regeneration; for it
is by Baptism that we are born children of God: That which is born of the Spirit, says our Lord, is spirit; and:
You must be born again. In the same way we have the words of St. Peter: Being born again, not of corruptible
seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth.

By reason of this redemption we have received the Holy Ghost and have been made worthy of the grace of God.
As a consequence of this gift we are the adopted sons of God, as the Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans when he
said: Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption of
sons, whereby we cry: "Abba, Father." The force and efficacy of this adoption are thus set forth by St. John:
Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the
sons of God.




Duties We Owe Our Heavenly Father

These points having been explained, the faithful should be reminded of all they owe in return to God, their most
loving Father, so that they may be aware of the extent of the love, piety, obedience and respect they are bound
to render to Him who has created them, who watches over them, and who has redeemed them; and with what
hope and trust they should invoke Him.

But to enlighten the ignorant and to correct the false ideas of such as imagine prosperity and success in life to be
the only test that God preserves and maintains His love towards us, and that the adversities and trials which
come from His hand are a sign that He is not well disposed towards us and that He entertains hostile
dispositions towards us, it will be necessary to point out that even if the hand of the Lord sometimes presses
heavily upon us, it is by no means because He is hostile to us, but that by striking us He heals us, and that the
wounds coming from God are remedies.

He chastises sinners so as to improve them by this lesson, and inflicts temporal punishments in order to deliver
them from eternal torments. For though He visits our iniquities with a rod and our sins with stripes, yet his
mercy he will not take away from us.

The faithful, therefore, should be recommended to recognise in such chastisements the fatherly love of God, and
ever to have in their hearts and on their lips the saying of Job, the most patient of men: He woundeth and cureth;
he striketh and his hands shall heal; as well as to repeat frequently the words written by Jeremias in the name of
the people of Israel: Thou hast chastised me and I was instructed, as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke:
convert me and I shall be converted; for thou art the Lord my God; and to keep before their eyes the example of
Tobias who, recognising in the loss of his sight the paternal hand of God raised against him, cried out: I bless
thee, O Lord God of Israel, because thou hast chastised me and thou hast saved me.

In this connection the faithful should be particularly on their guard against believing that any calamity or
affliction that befalls them can take place without the knowledge of God; for we have His own words: A hair of
your heads shall not perish. Let them rather find consolation in that divine oracle read in the Apocalypse: Those
whom I love I rebuke and chastise; and let them find comfort in the exhortation addressed by St. Paul to the


                                                       302
Hebrews: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord; neither be thou weaned whilst thou art rebuked by
him: for whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth, and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.... But if you be
without chastisement, ... then are you bastards and not sons.... Moreover if we have had the fathers of our flesh
for instructors, and we reverenced them, shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits and live?




"Our"

When we invoke the Father and when each one of us calls Him our Father, we are to understand thereby that
from the privilege and gift of divine adoption it necessarily follows that all the faithful are brethren and should
love each other as such: You are all brethren for one is your Father who is in heaven." This is why the Apostles
in their Epistles address all the faithful as brethren.

Another necessary consequence of this adoption is that not only are the faithful thereby united in the bonds of
brotherhood, but that, the Son of God being truly man, we are called and really are his brethren also. Thus, in
his Epistle to the Hebrews the Apostle, speaking of the Son of God, wrote as follows: He is not ashamed to call
them brethren, saying: "I will declare thy name to my brethren. And long before this, David had foretold this of
Christ the Lord; while Christ Himself thus addresses the women in the Gospel: Go, tell my brethren that they go
into Galilee; there they shall see me. These words, as we know, He pronounced only after His Resurrection and
when He had already put on immortality, thus showing that no one is at liberty to imagine that the bonds of
brotherhood with us have been severed by His Resurrection and Ascension into heaven. Not only has the
Resurrection of Christ not dissolved this union and love, but we know that one day, when from His throne of
glory and majesty He shall judge mankind of all ages, He will call even the very least of the faithful by the
name of brethren.

Indeed, how can we be other than brethren of Christ, seeing that we are called His co-heirs? Doubtless He is the
first begotten, the appointed heir of all things; but we are begotten in the second place after Him, and are His
co-heirs according to the measure of heavenly gifts we receive and according to the extent of the charity by
which we show ourselves servants and cooperators of the Holy Ghost. He it is who by His inspirations moves
and inflames us to virtue and good works, in order that we may be strengthened by His grace valiantly to
undertake the combat that must be waged to secure salvation. And if we wisely and firmly carry on this combat
we shall at the close of our earthly career be rewarded by our heavenly Father with the just recompense of that
crown promised and held out to all those who run the same course. God, says the Apostle, is not unjust that He
should forget your work and love.




Dispositions That Should Accompany The Words, "Our Father": Fraternal Regard

How sincere should be the manner in which we ought to utter the word our, we learn from St. Chrysostom. God,
he says, listens willingly to the Christian who prays not only for himself but for others; because to pray for
ourselves is an inspiration of nature; but to pray for others is an inspiration of grace; necessity compels us to
pray for ourselves, whereas fraternal charity calls on us to pray for others. And he adds: That prayer which is
inspired by fraternal charity is more agreeable to God than that which is dictated by necessity.

In connection with the important subject of salutary prayer, the pastor should be careful to remind and exhort all
the faithful of every age, condition and rank, never to forget the bonds of universal brotherhood that bind them,
and consequently ever to treat each other as friends and brothers, and never to seek arrogantly to raise
themselves above their neighbours.

Though there are in the Church of God various gradations of office, yet this diversity of dignity and position in
no way destroys the bond of fraternal union; just as in the human body the various uses and different functions
of our organs in no way cause this or that part of the body to lose the name or office of an organ of the body.


                                                       303
Take, for instance, one who wields kingly power. If he is a Christian, is he not the brother of all those united in
the communion of the Christian faith? Yes, beyond all doubt; and why? Because there is not one God giving
existence to the rich and noble, and another giving existence to the poor and to subjects. There is but one God,
the Father and Lord of all; and consequently we have all the same nobility of spiritual birth, all the same
dignity, all the same glory of race; for all have been regenerated by the same Spirit through the same Sacrament
of faith, and have been made children of God and co-heirs to the same inheritance. The wealthy and great have
not one Christ for their God; the poor and lowly, another; they are not initiated by different Sacraments; nor can
they expect a different inheritance in the kingdom of heaven. We are all brethren and, as the Apostle says in his
Epistle to the Ephesians: We are members of Christ's body, of his flesh and of his bones. This is a truth which
the same Apostle thus expresses in his Epistle to the Galatians: You are the children of God, by faith in Jesus
Christ; for as many of you as have been baptised in Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Greek nor Jew,
neither bond nor free, neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Now this is a point which calls for accuracy on the part of the pastor of souls, and one on which he should
purposely dwell at considerable length; for it is a subject that is calculated both to strengthen and animate the
poor and lowly, and to restrain and repress the arrogance of the rich and powerful. Indeed it was to remedy this
latter evil that the Apostle insisted on brotherly charity and so often impressed it on the ears of his hearers.




Filial Confidence And Piety

Do not, then, forget, oh Christian, that when about to address this prayer to God, you ought to approach Him as
a son to his Father; and hence in beginning your prayers and in pronouncing the words Our Father you should
consider the rank to which God in His goodness has raised you when He commands you to fly to Him, not as a
timid and fearful servant to his master, but willingly and confidently, like a child to its father.

In this remembrance and in this thought, consider with what fervour and piety you should pray. Endeavour to
act as becomes a child of God; that is to say, see that your prayers and actions are never unworthy of that divine
origin with which He has been pleased in His infinite bounty to ennoble you. It is to the discharge of this duty
that the Apostle exhorts us when he says: Be ye therefore imitators of God as most dear children, so that what
the Apostle wrote to the Thessalonians may be truly said of us: You are all the children of light, and the children
of the day.




"Who art in Heaven"




Meaning Of These Words

All who have a correct idea of God will grant that He is where and in all places. This is not to be taken in the
sense that He is distributed into parts and that He occupies and governs one place with one part and another
place with another part. God is a Spirit, and therefore utterly incapable of division into parts. Who will dare to
assign to any particular place or circumscribe within any limits that God who says of Himself: Do I not fill
heaven and earth? On the contrary, these words must be taken in this sense, that by His power and virtue He
embraces heaven and earth and all things contained therein; but that He Himself is not contained in any place.
God is present to all things, either creating them, or preserving them after He has created them; but He is
confined to no place, is limited by no bounds, nor in any way hindered from being everywhere present by His
substance and power, as is indicated by holy David in the words: If I ascend into heaven thou art there.




                                                        304
But though God is present in all places and in all things, without being bound by any limits, as has been already
said, yet in Sacred Scripture it is frequently said that He has His dwelling in heaven. And the reason is because
the heavens which we see above our heads are the noblest part of the world, remain ever Incorruptible, surpass
all other bodies in power, grandeur and beauty, and are endowed with fixed and regular motion.

God, then, in order to lift up the minds of men to contemplate His infinite power and majesty, which are so
preeminently visible in the work of the heavens, declares in Sacred Scripture that heaven is His dwelling-place.
Yet at the same time He often affirms, what indeed is most true, that there is no part of the universe to which He
is not present intimately by His nature and His power.




Lessons Taught By The Words, "Who Art In Heaven"

In connection with this consideration, however, let the faithful keep before their minds not only the image of the
common Father of all, but also of a God reigning in heaven; and hence when about to pray, let them remember
that they should raise heart and soul to heaven, and that the more the name of Father inspires them with hope
and trust, the more should the sublime nature and divine majesty of our Father who is in heaven inspire them
with sentiments of Christian humility and respect.

These words, furthermore, determine what we ought to ask of God in prayer; for every demand regarding the
needs and wants of this life, if it have not some reference to the goods of heaven and if it be not directed to that
end, is vain and unworthy of a Christian.

Let the pastor, therefore, instruct his pious hearers regarding this particular element of prayer, confirming his
own words by the authority of the Apostle: If you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.




              THE FIRST PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "Hallowed be thy name"




Why This Petition Is Placed First

What we are to ask of God and in what order, the Master and Lord of all has Himself taught and commanded.
For prayer is the ambassador and interpreter of our thoughts and desires; and consequently we pray well and
properly when the order of our petitions follows the order in which the things sought are desirable.

Now, genuine charity tells us to direct our whole soul and all our affections to God, for He alone being the one
supreme Good, it is but reasonable that we love Him with superior and singular love. On the other hand, God
cannot be loved from the heart and above all things else, unless we prefer His honour and glory to all things
created. For all the good that we or others possess, all that in any way bears the name of good, comes from Him,
and is therefore inferior to Him, the sovereign Good.

Hence, that our prayers may be made with due order, our Saviour has placed this Petition regarding the
sovereign Good at the head of all the other Petitions of the Lord's Prayer, thus showing us that before asking the
things necessary for ourselves or for others, we ought to ask those that appertain to God's honour, and to
manifest and make known to Him the affections and desires of our hearts in this regard. Acting thus, we shall be
faithful to the claims and rules of charity, which teaches us to love God more than ourselves and to ask, in the
first place, those things we desire on His account, and next, those things we desire on our own.




                                                        305
Object Of The First Three Petitions

But as our desires and petitions concern such things only as are needed, and as nothing can be added to God;
that is to say. to the Divine Nature, nor can His Divine Substance, which is ineffably rich in all perfection, be in
any way increased, we must remember that the things we ask of God on God's own account are extrinsic and
concern His exterior glory.

Thus we desire and beg that His name may be more and better known in the world, that His kingdom may be
extended, and that each day new servants may come to obey His holy will. These three things, His name, His
kingdom, and obedience (to His will), do not appertain to the intrinsic nature and perfection of God, but are
extrinsic thereto.

To enable the faithful to understand still more clearly the force and bearing of these Petitions, the pastor should
take care to point out to them that the words, On earth as it is in heaven, may be understood of each of the first
three Petitions, as follows: Hallowed be thy name on earth as it is in heaven; Thy kingdom come on earth as it is
in heaven; and, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.




Hallowed Be Thy Name

In praying that the name of God may be hallowed, our meaning is that the sanctity and glory of the divine name
may be increased.




On Earth As It Is In Heaven"

But in this connection the pastor should observe and should point out to his pious hearers that our Saviour does
not in this expression say that the name of God is to be sanctified on earth in the same manner as it is in heaven;
that is, that its earthly sanctification is to be equal in magnificence to its heavenly, a thing which is absolutely
impossible, but only that such sanctification proceed from love and from the inmost affections of the soul. True,
indeed, the divine name has in itself no need to be sanctified, since it is terrible and -holy,' as God Himself in
His very Nature is holy, nor can any holiness be attributed Him which He has not possessed from all eternity;
yet seeing that here below an honour far inferior to that which He deserves is rendered to Him, and that
sometimes even He is dishonoured by cursing and blasphemy, we therefore desire and beg that His name may
be exalted here on earth with praise, honour, and glory, after the example of that praise, honour and glory which
are given Him in heaven.




What Sanctification of God's Name we should Pray For




That The Faithful May Glorify Him

In other words we pray that our minds, our souls and our lips may be so devoted to the honour and worship of
God as to glorify Him. with all veneration both interior and exterior, and, after the model of the heavenly
citizens, to celebrate with all our might the greatness, the glory and the holiness of the name of God.



                                                        306
That Unbelievers May Be Converted

Thus, then, as the heavenly spirits with perfect unanimity exalt and glorify God, so do we pray that the same be
done over all the earth; that all nations may come to know, worship, and reverence God; that all without a single
exception may embrace the Christian religion, may devote themselves wholly to the service of God, and may be
convinced that in Him is the source of all sanctity and that there is nothing pure, nothing holy, that does not
proceed from the sanctity of His divine name. According to the testimony of the Apostle, The church is
cleansed by the laver of water in the word of life. and the word of life signifies the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost in which we are baptised and sanctified.

And since there is no expiation, no purity, no integrity, in him over whom the divine name has not been
invoked, we desire and pray that all mankind may abandon the darkness of their impious infidelity, and,
enlightened by the rays of divine light, may come to recognise the power of this name and look to it alone for
true sanctity, and that thus receiving the Sacrament of Baptism in the name of the holy and undivided Trinity,
they may receive the plenitude of sanctity from the right hand of God Himself.




That Sinners May Be Converted

Moreover, our desires and our supplications extend equally to those, who, stained with sin and wickedness,
have lost the purity of their Baptism and their robe of innocence, thus permitting the unclean spirit to take up his
abode once more in their unhappy souls. We therefore desire and pray God that in these also His name may be
sanctified; that they may reenter into themselves and, returning to a right frame of mind, may recover their
former holiness through the Sacrament of Penance, and become once more the pure and holy temple and
dwelling-place of God.




That God May Be Thanked For His Favours

Finally, we pray that God may make His light to shine on the minds of all, so as to enable them to see that every
best gift and e very perfect gift coming from the Father of lights, is conferred on us by Him, and consequently
that temperance, justice, life, health, in a word, all goods of soul, body and possessions, all goods both natural
and supernatural, must be recognised as gifts given by Him from whom, as the Church proclaims, proceed all
blessings. If the sun by its light, if the stars by their motion and revolutions, are of any advantage to man; if the
air with which we are surrounded serves to sustain us; if the earth with its abundance of produce and its fruits
furnishes the means of subsistence to all men; if our rulers by their vigilance enable us to enjoy peace and
tranquillity, it is to the infinite goodness of God that we owe these and innumerable blessings of a similar kind,-
nay, those very causes which philosophers call secondary, we should regard as so many hands of God,
wonderfully fashioned and fitted for our use, by means of which He distributes His blessings and diffuses them
everywhere in profusion.




That The Church May Be Recognised By All

But what we most particularly ask in this Petition is that all may acknowledge and revere the spouse of Jesus
Christ, our most holy mother the Church, in which alone is to be found the copious and inexhaustible fountain
that cleanses and effaces all the stains of sin, and from which are drawn all the Sacraments of salvation and
sanctification, those Sacraments through which, like so many sacred channels, is diffused over us by the hand of



                                                        307
God the dew, of sanctity. To that Church alone and to those whom she embraces in her bosom and holds in her
arms, appertains the invocation of that divine name, outside of which there is no other name under heaven given
to men whereby we must be saved.




What Sanctification Of God's Name We Should Practice

The pastor should be careful to insist particularly on the fact that it is the duty of a good son not only to pray to
God his Father in words, but also to endeavour by his conduct and actions to promote the sanctification of the
divine name. And would to God there were none who, though continually praying for the sanctification of God's
name, yet, as far as in them lies, violate and profane it by their deeds, and by whose fault God Himself is
sometimes blasphemed. It was of such as these that the Apostle said: The name of God through you is
blasphemed among the Gentiles; and in Ezechiel we read: They entered among the nations whither they went,
and profaned my holy name, when it was said of them: "This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth
out of his land"; for according to the sort of life and conduct led by those professing a particular religion, so
precisely in the eyes of the unlettered multitude will be the opinion held of that religion and of its author.

Those, therefore, who live according to the dictates of the Christian religion which they have embraced, and
who regulate their prayers and actions by its precepts, furnish others with a powerful motive for greatly
praising, honouring and glorifying the name of our heavenly Father. As for us, it is a duty which the Lord has
imposed on us, to lead others by shining deeds of virtue to praise and glorify the name of God. This is how He
addresses us in the Gospel: Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify
your Father who is in heaven; and the Prince of the Apostles says: Having your conversation good among the
Gentiles, that they may, by the good works which they shall behold in you, glorify God.




              THE SECOND PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "Thy kingdom come"




Importance Of Instruction On This Petition

The kingdom of heaven which we pray for in this second Petition is the great end to which is referred, and in
which terminates all the preaching of the Gospel; for from it St. John the Baptist commenced his exhortation to
penance: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. With it also the Saviour of the world opened His
preaching. In that admirable discourse on the mount in which He points out to His disciples the way to
happiness, having proposed, as it were, the subject-matter of His discourse, our Lord commences with the
kingdom of heaven: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Again, to those who
would detain Him with them, He assigns as the necessary cause of His departure: To other cities, also, I must
preach the kingdom of God; therefore am I sent. This kingdom He afterwards commanded the Apostles to
preach. And to him who expressed a wish to go and bury his father, He replied: Go thou, and preach the
kingdom of God. And after He had risen from the dead, during those forty days in which He appeared to the
Apostles, He spoke of the kingdom of God.

This second Petition, therefore, the pastor should treat with the greatest attention, in order to impress on the
minds of his faithful hearers its great importance and necessity.




Greatness Of This Petition




                                                        308
In the first place pastors will be greatly assisted towards an accurate and careful explanation of this Petition by
the thought that (the Redeemer Himself) commanded this Petition, although united to the others, to be also
offered separately, in order that we may seek with the greatest earnestness that for which we pray; for He says:
Seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.

So great and so abundant are the heavenly gifts contained in this Petition, that it includes all things necessary for
the security of soul and body. The king who pays no attention to those things on which depends the safety of his
kingdom we should deem unworthy of the name. If a man is so anxious for the welfare of his kingdom, what
must be the solicitude, what the providential care, with which the King of kings guards the life and safety of
man?

We compress, therefore, within the small compass of this Petition for God's kingdom all that we stand in need
of in our present pilgrimage, or rather exile, and all this God graciously promises to grant us; for He
immediately subjoins: All these things shall be added unto you. Thus does he declare that He is that king who
with bountiful hand bestows upon man an abundance of all things, whose infinite goodness enraptured David
when he sang: The Lord ruleth me, and I shall want nothing.




Necessity Of Rightly Making This Petition

It is not enough, however, that we utter an earnest petition for the kingdom of God; we must also add to our
prayer the use of all those means by which that kingdom is sought and found.- The five foolish virgins uttered
earnestly the same petition in these words: Lord, Lord, open to us; but they used not the means necessary to
secure its attainment, and were therefore rightly excluded. For God Himself has said: Not every one that saith to
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.




Motives For Adopting The Necessary Means

The priest, therefore, who is charged with the care of souls, should draw from the exhaustless fountain of the
divine Scriptures those powerful motives which are calculated to move the faithful to the desire and pursuit of
the kingdom of heaven, which portray in vivid coloring our deplorable condition, and which should make so
sensible an impression upon them that, entering into themselves, they may call to mind that supreme happiness
and those unutterable goods with which the eternal abode of God our Father abounds.

Here below we are exiles, inhabitants of a land in which dwell those demons whose hatred for us cannot be
softened, who are the determined and implacable foes of mankind. What shall we say of those intestine conflicts
and domestic battles in which the soul and the body, the flesh and the spirit, are continually engaged against
each other, in which we have always to fear defeat, nay, in which instant defeat becomes inevitable, unless we
be defended by the protecting hand of God? Feeling this weight of misery the Apostle exclaims: Unhappy man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

The misery of our condition, it is true, strikes us at once of itself; but if contrasted with that of other creatures, it
strikes us still more forcibly. Although irrational and even inanimate, the lower creatures are seldom seen so to
depart from the acts, the instincts and the movements imparted to them by nature, as to fail of obtaining their
appointed and determined end. This is so obvious in the case of beasts, fishes and birds that there is no need to
dwell on it. But if we look to the heavens, do we not behold the verification of these words of David? For ever,
O Lord, thy word standeth firm in the heavens. Constant in their motions, uninterrupted in their revolutions,
they never depart in the least from the laws divinely prescribed. The earth, too, and universal nature, as we at
once perceive, adhere strictly to, or at least depart but very little from the laws of their being.




                                                          309
But unhappy man is guilty of frequent falls. Seldom does he carry out his good resolutions; often he abandons
and despises what he has well commenced; his best purposes which pleased for a time, are often suddenly
abandoned, and he plunges into designs as degrading as they are pernicious.

What then is the cause of this misery and inconstancy? Manifestly a contempt of the divine inspirations. We
close our ears to the admonitions of God, our eyes to the divine lights which shine before us; nor do we hearken
to those salutary commands which are delivered by our heavenly Father.

To paint to the eyes of the faithful the misery-of man's condition, to detail its various causes, and to point out
the efficacious remedies are, therefore, among the objects which should employ the zealous exertions of the
pastor. In the discharge of this duty, his labor will be not a little lightened if he consults what has been said on
the subject by those holy men, John Chrysostom and Augustine, and still more if he refers to our exposition of
the Creed. For with a knowledge of these truths, who will be so obstinate in sin as not to endeavour, with the
help of God's preventing grace, to rise, like the prodigal son spoken of in the Gospel, to stand erect, and hasten
into the presence of his heavenly Father and king ?




"Thy Kingdom"

Having pointed out the advantages to be derived by the faithful from this Petition, the pastor should next
explain the favours which it seeks. This becomes the more necessary as the words, kingdom of God, have a
variety of significations, the exposition of each of which will not be found without its advantages in elucidating
other passages of Scripture, and is necessary to a knowledge of the present subject.




The Kingdom Of Nature

In their ordinary sense, which is frequently employed by Scripture, the words, kingdom of God, signify not only
that power which God possesses over all men and over the entire universe, but, also, His providence which rules
and governs all things. In his hands, says the Prophet, are all the ends of the earth. The word ends includes those
things also which lie buried in the depths of the earth, and are concealed in the most hidden recesses of creation.
In this sense Mardochaeus exclaims: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is
none that can resist thy will: thou art God of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.




The Kingdom Of Grace

By the kingdom of God is also understood that special and singular providence by which God protects and
watches over pious and holy men. It is of this peculiar and admirable care that David speaks when he says: The
Lord rules me, I shall want nothing, and Isaias: The Lord our king he will save us.

But although, even in this life, the pious and holy are placed, in a special manner, under this kingly power of
God; yet our Lord Himself informed Pilate that His kingdom was not of this world, that is to say, had not its
origin in this world, which was created and is doomed to perish. In this perishable way power is exercised by
kings, emperors, commonwealths, rulers, and all whose titles to the government of states and provinces is
founded upon the desire or election of men, or who have intruded themselves, by violent and unjust usurpation,
into sovereign power.

Not so Christ the Lord, who, as the Prophet declares, is appointed king by God, and whose kingdom, as the
Apostle says, is justice: The kingdom of God's justice and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Christ our Lord



                                                        310
reigns in us by the interior virtues of faith, hope and charity. By these virtues we are made a portion, as it were,
of His kingdom, become subject in a special manner to God, and are consecrated to His worship and veneration;
so that, as the Apostle could say: I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, we too are able to say: I reign, yet not ,
but Christ reigneth in me.

This kingdom is called justice, because it has for its basis the justice of Christ the Lord. Of it our Lord says in
St. Luke: The kingdom of God is within you. For although Jesus Christ reigns by faith in all who are within the
bosom of our holy mother, the Church; yet in a special manner He reigns over those who are endowed with a
superior faith, hope and charity, and have yielded themselves pure and living members to God. It is in these that
the kingdom of God's grace is said to consist.




The Kingdom Of Glory

By the words kingdom of God is also meant that kingdom of His glory, of which Christ our Lord says in St.
Matthew: Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom which was prepared for you from the beginning
of the world. This kingdom the thief, when he had admirably acknowledged his crimes, begged of Christ in the
words related by St. Luke: Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy kingdom. Of this kingdom St. John
speaks when he says: Unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God; and of it the Apostle says to the Ephesians: No fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a
serving of idols) hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. To it also refer some of the parables
made use of by Christ the Lord when speaking of the kingdom of heaven.

But the kingdom of grace must precede that of glory; for God's glory cannot reign in anyone in whom His grace
does not already reign. Grace, according to the Redeemer, is a fountain of water springing up to eternal life;
while as regards glory, what can we call it except a certain perfect and absolute grace? As long as we are
clothed with this frail mortal flesh, as long as we wander in this gloomy pilgrimage and exile, weak and far
away from God, we often stumble and fall, because we rejected the aid of the kingdom of grace, by which we
were supported. But when the light of the kingdom of glory, which is perfect, shall have shone upon us, we
shall stand forever firm and secure. Then shall all that is defective and unsuitable be utterly removed; then shall
every infirmity be strengthened and invigorated; in a word, God Himself will then reign in our souls and bodies.
But on this subject we have dealt already at greater length in the exposition of the Creed, when speaking of the
resurrection of the flesh.




"Come"

Having thus explained the ordinary acceptation of the words, kingdom of God, we now come to point out the
particular objects contemplated by this Petition.




We Pray For The Propagation Of The Church

In this Petition we ask God that the kingdom of Christ, that is, His Church, may be enlarged; that Jews and
infidels may embrace the faith of Christ and the knowledge of the true God; that schismatics and heretics may
return to soundness of mind, and to the communion of the Church of God which they have deserted; and that
thus may be fulfilled and realised the words of the Lord, spoken by the mouth of Isaias: Enlarge the place of thy
tent, and stretch out the skins of thy tabernacles; lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes, for thou shalt
pass on to the right hand and to the left, for he that made thee shall rule over thee. And again: The Gentiles shall
walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness of thy rising; lift up thy eyes round about and see; all these are



                                                          311
gathered together, they are come to thee; thy sons shall come from afar, and thy daughters shall rise up at thy
side.




For The Conversion Of Sinners

But in the Church there are to be found those who profess they know God, but in their works deny Him; whose
conduct shows that they have only a deformed faith; who, by sinning, become the dwelling-place of the devil,
where the demon exercises uncontrolled dominion. Therefore do we pray that the kingdom of God may also
come to them so that the darkness of sin being dispelled from around them, and their minds being illumined by
the rays of the divine light, they may be restored to their lost dignity of children of God; that heresy and schism
being removed, and all offences and causes of sins being eradicated from His kingdom, our heavenly Father
may cleanse the floor of His Church; and that, worshipping God in piety and holiness, she may enjoy
undisturbed peace and tranquillity.




That Christ May Reign Over All

Finally, we pray that God alone may live, alone may reign within us; that death may no longer exist, but may be
absorbed in the victory achieved by Christ our Lord, who, having broken and scattered the power of all His
enemies, may, in His might, subject all things to His dominion.




Dispositions That Should Accompany This Petition

The pastor should also be mindful to teach the faithful, as the nature of this Petition demands, the thoughts and
reflections with which their minds should be impressed in order to offer this prayer devoutly to God.




We Should Prize God's Kingdom Above All Things

He should exhort them, in the first place, to consider the force and import of that similitude of the Redeemer:
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field: which when a man hath found he hideth, and for joy
thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. He who knows the riches of Christ the Lord will
despise all things when compared to them; to him wealth, riches, power, will appear as dross. Nothing can be
compared to, or stand in competition with that inestimable treasure. Whoever, then, is blessed with this
knowledge will say with the Apostle: I esteem all things to be but loss, and count them but as dung, that I may
gain Christ. This is that precious jewel of the Gospel, and he who sells all his earthly goods to purchase it shall
enjoy an eternity of bliss.

Happy we, should Jesus Christ shed so much light on us, as to enable us to discover this jewel of divine grace,
by which He reigns in the hearts of those that are His. Then should we be prepared to sell all that we have on
earth, even ourselves, to purchase and secure its possession; then might we say with confidence: Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ?

But would we know the incomparable excellence of the kingdom of God's glory, let us hear the words and
teaching of the Apostle: Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what
things God hath prepared for them that love him.




                                                       312
We Must Realise That We Are Exiles

To obtain the object of our prayers it will be found most helpful to reflect within ourselves who we are, --
namely, children of Adam, exiled from Paradise by a just sentence of banishment, and deserving, by our
unworthiness and perversity, to become the objects of God's supreme hatred, and to be doomed to eternal
punishment.

This consideration should excite in us humility and lowliness. Thus our prayers will be full of Christian
humility; and wholly distrusting ourselves, like the publican, we will fly to the mercy of God. Attributing all to
His bounty we will render immortal thanks to Him who has imparted to us that Holy Spirit, relying on whom
we are emboldened to say: Abba (Father).




We Must Labor To Obtain God's Kingdom

We should also be careful to consider what is to be done, what avoided, in order to arrive at the kingdom of
heaven. For we are not called by God to lead lives of ease and indolence. On the contrary, He declares that the
kingdom of God suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away; and, If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments. It is not enough, therefore, that we pray for the kingdom of God; we must also use our best
exertions. It is a duty incumbent on US to cooperate with the grace of God, to use it in pursuing the path that
leads to heaven. God never abandons us; He has promised to be with us at all times. We have therefore only this
to see to, that we forsake not God, or abandon ourselves.

In this kingdom of the Church, God has provided all those succours by which He defends the life of man, and
accomplishes his eternal salvation; whether they are invisible to us, such as the hosts of angelic spirits, or
visible, such as the Sacraments, those unfailing sources of heavenly grace. Defended by these divine safeguards,
not only may we securely defy the assaults of our most determined enemies, but may even lay prostrate, and
trample under foot, the tyrant himself with all his nefarious legions.




Recapitulation

To conclude, let us then earnestly implore the Spirit of God that He may command us to do all things in
accordance with His holy will; that He may so overthrow the empire of Satan that it shall have no power over us
on the great accounting day; that Christ may be victorious and triumphant; that the divine influence of His law
may be spread throughout the world; that His ordinances may be observed; that there be found no traitor, no
deserter; and that all may so conduct themselves, as to come with joy into the presence of God their King, and
may reach the possession of the celestial kingdom, prepared for them from all eternity, in the fruition of endless
bliss with Christ Jesus.




                 THE THIRD PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "Thy will be done"




The Relation Of This Petition To The Previous One




                                                       313
Whoever desires to enter into the kingdom of heaven should ask of God that His will may be done. For Christ
the Lord has said: Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. Consequently this
Petition follows immediately after the one which prays for the kingdom of heaven.




Necessity Of This Petition

In order that the faithful may know the necessity of this Petition and the numerous and salutary gifts which we
obtain through it, the pastor should direct their attention to the misery and wretchedness in which the sin of
Adam has involved mankind.




Man’s Proneness To Act Against God’s Will

From the beginning God implanted in all creatures an inborn desire of pursuing their own happiness that, by a
sort of natural impulse, they may seek and desire their own end, from which they never deviate, unless impeded
by some external obstacle.- This impulse of seeking God, the author and father of his happiness, was in the
beginning all the more noble and exalted in man because of the fact that he was endowed with reason and
judgment. But, while irrational creatures, which, at their creation were by nature Food, continued, and still
continue in that original state and-condition, unhappy man went astray, and lost not only original justice, with
which he had been supernaturally gifted and adorned by God, but also obscured that singular inclination toward
virtue which had been implanted in his soul. All, He says, have gone aside, they are become unprofitable
together; there is none that doth good, no, not one. For the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to
evil from his youth. Hence it is not difficult to perceive that of himself no man is wise unto salvation; that all
are prone to evil; and that man has innumerable corrupt propensities, since he tends downwards and is carried
with ardent precipitancy to anger, hatred, pride. ambition, and to almost every species of evil.




Man’s Blindness Concerning God’s Will

Although man is continually beset by these evils, yet his greatest misery is that many of these appear to him not
to be evils at all. It is a proof of the most calamitous condition of man, that he is so blinded by passion and
cupidity as not to see that what he deems salutary generally contains a deadly poison, that he rushes headlong
after those pernicious evils as if they were good and desirable, while those things which are really good and
virtuous are shunned as the contrary. Of this false estimate and corrupt judgment of man God thus expresses His
detestation: Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light and light for darkness; that
put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.

In order, therefore, to delineate in vivid coloring the misery of our condition, the Sacred Scripture compares us
to those who have lost their sense of taste and who, in consequence, loathe wholesome food, and prefer that
which is unwholesome.




Man’s Weakness In Fulfilling God’s Will

It also compares us to sick persons who, as long as their malady lasts, are incapable of fulfilling the duties and
offices proper to persons of sound and vigorous health. In the same way neither can we, without the assistance
of divine grace, undertake actions such as are acceptable to God. Even should we, while in this condition,



                                                       314
succeed in doing anything good, it will be of little or no avail towards attaining the bliss of heaven. But to love
and serve God as we ought is something too noble and too sublime for us to accomplish by human powers in
our present lowly and feeble condition, unless we are assisted by the grace of God.

Another very apt comparison to denote the miserable condition of mankind is that wherein we are likened to
children who, if left to go their own way, are thoughtlessly attracted by everything that presents itself. Truly we
are children, thoughtless children, wholly devoted to vain conversations and frivolous actions, once we become
destitute of divine assistance; and hence the reproof which divine wisdom directs against us: O children, how
long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves? while the Apostle
thus exhorts us: Do not become children in sense.

Not only this, but our folly and blindness are even greater than those of children; for they are merely destitute of
human prudence which they can of themselves acquire in course of time; whereas, if not assisted by God's help
and grace, we can never aspire to that divine prudence which is so necessary to salvation. And if God's
assistance should fail us, we at once cast aside those things that are truly good and rush headlong to voluntary
ruin.




Remedy For These Evils

But should this darkness of spirit be removed with God's help; should we but perceive these our miseries; and,
shaking off our insensibility, should we take account of the presence of the law of the members and recognise
the struggle of the senses against the law of the spirit; and were we aware of every inclination of our nature to
evil; how in that event could we fail to seek with earnest endeavour a suitable remedy for the great evils with
which our nature is oppressed, and how fail to sigh for that salutary rule in accordance with which every
Christian's life should be modelled and guided?

Now this is what we ask when we address to God these words: Thy will be done. We fell into this state of
misery by disobeying and despising the divine will. God vouchsafes to propose to us, as the sole corrective of
such great evils, a conformity to His will, which by sinning we despised; He commands us to regulate all our
thoughts and actions by this standard. Now it is precisely His help to accomplish this that we ask when we
suppliantly address to God the prayer, Thy will be done.




Man's Passions Rebel Against God's Will

The same should also be the fervent prayer of those in whose souls God-already reigns; who have been already
illumined with the divine light, which enables them to obey the will of God. Although thus prepared, they have
still to struggle against their own passions on account of the tendency to evil implanted in man's sensual
appetite. Hence even though we are of the number of the just, we are still exposed to great danger from our own
frailty, and should always fear lest, drawn aside and allured by our concupiscences, which war in our members,
we should again stray from the path of salvation. Of this danger Christ the Lord admonishes us in these words:
Watch ye and pray that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.

It is not in the power of man, not even of him who has been justified by the grace of God, to reduce the irregular
desires of the flesh to such a state of utter subjection that they may never afterwards rebel. By justifying grace
God no doubt heals the wounds of the soul; but not those also of the flesh concerning which the Apostle wrote:
J know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good.

The moment the first man forfeited original justice, which enabled him to bridle the passions, reason was no
longer able to restrain them within the bounds of duty, or to repress those inordinate desires which are



                                                        315
repugnant to reason. This is why the Apostle tells us that sin, that is to say, the incentive to sin, dwells in the
flesh, thus giving us to understand that it does not make a mere temporary stay within us as a passing guest, but
that as long as we live it maintains its abode in our members as a permanent inhabitant of the body.

Continually beset as we are by our domestic and interior enemies, it is easy for us to understand that we must
fly to God's help and beg of Him that His will may be done in us.




"Thy Will"

Though the faithful are not to be left in ignorance of the import of this Petition, yet in this connection many
questions concerning the will of God may be passed over which are discussed at great length and with much
utility by scholastic doctors. Accordingly we shall content ourselves with saying that by the will of God is here
meant that will which is commonly called the will of sign; that is to say, whatever God has commanded or
counselled us to do or to avoid.

Hence, under the word will are here comprised all things that have been proposed to us as a means of securing
the happiness of heaven, whether they regard faith or whether they regard morals, all, in a word, that Christ the
Lord has commanded or forbidden either directly or through His Church. It is of this will that the Apostle thus
writes: Become not unwise, but understand what is the will of God.




"Be Done"




We Ask That We May Fulfil What God Desires Of Us

When, therefore, we pray, Thy will be done, we first of all ask our heavenly Father to give us the strength to
obey His Commandments, and to serve Him in holiness and justice all our days; to do all things according to
His will and pleasure; to discharge all the duties prescribed for us in Sacred Scripture; under His guidance and
assistance to perform all that becomes those who are born, not of the will of the flesh but of God, thus following
the example of Christ the Lord who was made obedient unto death, even unto the death of the cross; finally, to
be ready to bear all things rather than depart from His holy will in even the slightest degree.

Assuredly there is no one who burns with a more ardent desire and anxiety to obtain (the effect of this Petition)
than he who has been so blessed as to be able to understand the sublime dignity attaching to those who obey
God. For such a one thoroughly understands how true it is to say that to serve God and obey Him is to reign.
Whoever, says the Lord, shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother
that is to say, to him am I attached by the closest bonds of good will and love.

The Saints, with scarcely a single exception, failed not to make the principal gift contemplated by this Petition
the object of their fervent prayers to God. All, indeed, have in substance made use of this admirable prayer, but
not unfrequently in different words. David, whose strains breathe such wondrous sweetness, pours out the same
prayer in various aspirations: O ! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications; Lead me into the path
of thy commandments; Direct my steps according to thy word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me. In
the same spirit he says: Give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments; Teach me thy judgments;
Give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies. He often expresses and repeats the same sentiment in
other words. These passages should be carefully noticed and explained to the faithful, that all may know and
comprehend the greatness and profusion of salutary gifts which are comprehended in the first part of this
Petition.



                                                       316
We Ask That We May Not Yield To Our Own Inordinate Desires

In the second place, when we say, Thy will be done, we express our detestation of the works of the flesh, of
which the Apostle writes: The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness immodesty,
lust, etc.; if you live according to the flesh you shall die. We also beg of God not to suffer us to yield to the
suggestions of sensual appetite, of our lusts, of our infirmities, but to govern our will by His will.

The sensualist, whose every thought and care is absorbed in the transient things of this world, is estranged from
the will of God. Borne along by the tide of passion, he indulges his licentious appetites. In this gratification he
places all his happiness, and considers that man happy who obtains whatever he desires. We, the contrary,
beseech God in the language of the Apostle that we make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscence, but
that His will be done.

We are not easily induced to entreat God not to satisfy our inordinate desires. This disposition of soul is difficult
of attainment, and by offering such a prayer we seem in some sort to hate ourselves. To those who are slaves to
the flesh such conduct appears folly; but be it ours cheerfully to incur the imputation of folly for the sake of
Christ who has said: If any man will come after me, let him deny himself. This is especially so since we know
that it is much better to desire what is right and just, than to obtain what is opposed to reason and religion and to
the laws of God. Unquestionably the condition of the man who attains the gratification of his rash and
inordinate desires is less enviable than that of him who does not obtain the object of his pious prayers.




We Ask That Our Mistaken Requests Be Not Granted

Our prayers, however, have not solely for object that God should deny us what accords with our desires, when it
is clear that they are depraved; but also that He would not grant us those things for which, under the persuasion
and impulse of the devil, who transforms himself into an Angel of light, we sometimes pray, believing them to
be good.

The desire of the Prince of the Apostles to dissuade the Lord from His determination to meet death, appeared
not less reasonable than religious; yet the Lord severely rebuked him, because he was led, not by supernatural
motives, but by natural feeling.

What stronger proof of love towards the Lord than that shown by the request of St. James and St. John, who,
filled with indignation against the Samaritans for refusing to entertain their Master, besought Him to command
fire to descend from heaven and consume those hard-hearted and inhuman men? Yet they were reproved by
Christ the Lord in these words: You know not of what spirit you are; the son of man came not to destroy souls
but to save them.




We Ask That Even Our Good Requests Be Granted Only When They Are According To God’s Will

We should beseech God that His will be done, not only when our desires are wrong, or have the appearance of
wrong. We should ask this even when the object of our desire is not really evil, as when the will, obeying its
instinctive impulse, desires what is necessary for our preservation, and rejects what seems to be opposed
thereto. When about to pray for such things we should say from our hearts, Thy will be done, in imitation of the
example of Him from whom we receive salvation and the science of salvation, who, when agitated by a natural
dread of torments and of a cruel death, bowed in that horror of supreme sorrow with meek submission to the
will of His heavenly Father: Not my will but thine be done.



                                                        317
We Ask That God May Perfect In Us What His Grace Has Begun

But, such is the degeneracy of our nature that, even when we have done violence to our passions and subjected
them to the will of God, we cannot avoid sin without His assistance, by which we are protected from evil and
directed in the pursuit of good. To this Petition, therefore, we must have recourse, beseeching God to perfect in
us those things which He has begun; to repress the turbulent emotions of passion; to subject our sensual
appetites to reason; in a word, to render us entirely conformable to His holy will.




We Ask That All May Know God’s Will

We pray that the whole world may receive the knowledge of God's will, that the mystery of God, hidden from
all ages and generations, may be made known to all.




"On Earth as it is in Heaven"

We also pray for the standard and model of this obedience, that our conformity to the will of God be regulated
according to the rule observed in heaven by the blessed Angels and choirs of heavenly spirits, that, as they
willingly and with supreme joy obey God, we too may yield a cheerful obedience to His will in the manner
most acceptable to Him.

God requires that in serving Him we be actuated by the greatest love and by the most exalted charity; that
although we devote ourselves entirely to Him with the hope of receiving heaven as reward, yet the reason we
look forward to that reward should be that the Divine Majesty has commanded us to cherish that hope. Let all
our hopes, therefore, be based on the love of God, who promises to reward our love with eternal happiness.

There are some who serve another with love, but who do so solely with a view to some recompense, which is
the end and aim of their love; while others, influenced by love and loyalty alone, look to nothing else in the
services which they render than the goodness and worth of him whom they serve, and, knowing and admiring
his qualities consider themselves happy in being able to render him these services. This is the meaning of the
clause On earth as it is in heaven appended (to the Petition).

It is then, our duty to endeavour to the best of our ability to be obedient to God, as we have said the blessed
spirits are, whose profound obedience is praised by David in the Psalm in which he sings: Bless the Lord, all ye
hosts; ye ministers of his that do his will.

Should anyone, adopting the interpretation of St. Cyprian, understand the words in heaven, to mean in the good
and the pious, and the words on earth, in the wicked and the impious, we do not disapprove of the interpretation,
by the word heaven understanding the spirit, and by the word earth, the flesh, that every person and every
creature may in all things obey the will of God.




This Petition Contains an Act of Thanksgiving

This Petition also includes thanksgiving. We revere the most holy will of God, and in transports of joy celebrate
all His works with the highest praise and acknowledgment, being assured that He has done all things well. It is
certain that God is omnipotent; and the consequence necessarily forces itself on the mind that all things were


                                                       318
created at His command. We also confess the truth that He is the supreme Good. We must, therefore, confess
that all His works are good, for to all He imparted His own goodness. But if we cannot fathom in everything the
divine plan, let us in all things banish every doubt and hesitation from the mind, and with the Apostle declare
that his ways are unsearchable.

But the most powerful incentive to revere the will of God is that He has deigned to illumine by His heavenly
light; for, He hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son
of his love.




The Dispositions that should Accompany this Petition




A Sense Of Our Own Weakness Of Will

To close our exposition of this Petition we must revert to a subject at which we glanced in the beginning. It is
that the faithful in uttering this Petition should be humble and lowly in spirit: keeping in view the violence of
their inborn passions which revolt against the will of God; recollecting that in this duty (of obedience) man is
excelled by all other creatures, of whom it is written: All things serve thee; and reflecting, that he who is unable
without divine help to undertake, not to say, perform, anything acceptable to God, must be very weak indeed.




Appreciation Of The Dignity Of Doing God's Will

But as there is nothing greater, nothing more exalted, as we have already said, than to serve God and live in
obedience to His law and Commandments, what more desirable to a Christian than to walk in the ways of the
Lord, to think nothing, to undertake nothing, at variance with His will? In order that the faithful may adopt this
rule of life, and adhere to it with greater fidelity, (the pastor) should borrow from Scripture examples of
individuals, who, by not referring their views to the will of God, have failed in all their undertakings.




Resignation To God’s Will

Finally, the faithful are to be admonished to acquiesce in the simple and absolute will of God. Let him, who
thinks that he occupies a place in society inferior to his deserts, bear his lot with patient resignation; let him not
abandon his proper sphere, but abide in the vocation to which he has been called. Let him subject his own
judgment to the will of God, who provides better for our interests than we can even desire ourselves. If troubled
by poverty, by sickness, by persecution, or afflictions and anxieties of any sort, let us be convinced that none of
these things can happen to us without the permission of God, who is the supreme Arbiter of all things. We
should, therefore, not suffer our minds to be too much disturbed by them, but bear up against them with
fortitude, having always on our lips the words: The will of the Lord be done; and also those of holy Job, As it
hath pleased the Lord, so it is done: blessed be the name of the Lord.




       THE FOURTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "Give us this day our daily bread"




                                                         319
The Relation Of The Following Petitions To Those That Preceded

The fourth and following Petitions, in which we particularly and expressly pray for the needs of soul and body,
are subordinate to those which preceded. According to the order of the Lord's Prayer we ask for what regards
the body and the preservation of life after we have prayed for the things which pertain to God. For since man
has God as his last end, the goods of human life should be subordinated to those that are divine. These goods
should be desired and prayed for, either because the divine order so requires, or because we need them to obtain
divine blessings, that being assisted by these (temporal things) we may reach our destined end, the kingdom and
glory of our heavenly Father, and the reverential observance of those commands which we know to emanate
from His holy will. In this Petition, therefore, we should refer all to God and His glory.




How To Pray For Temporal Blessings

In the discharge of his duty towards the faithful the pastor, therefore, should endeavour to make them
understand that, in praying for the use and enjoyment of temporal blessings, our minds and our desires are to be
directed in conformity with the law of God, from which we are not to swerve in the least. By praying for the
transient things of this world, we especially transgress; for, as the Apostle says, We know not what we should
pray for as we ought. These things, therefore, we should pray for as we ought, lest, praying for anything as we
ought not, we receive from God for answer, You know not what you ask.




Means Of Ascertaining Purity Of Intention In Offering This Petition

A sure standard for judging what petition is good, and what bad, is the purpose and intention of the petitioner.
Thus if a person prays for temporal blessings under the impression that they constitute the sovereign good, and
rests in them as the ultimate end of his desires, wishing nothing else, he unquestionably does not pray as he
ought. As St. Augustine observes, we ask not these temporal things as our goods, but as our necessaries. The
Apostle also in his Epistle to the Corinthians teaches that whatever regards the necessary purposes of life is to
be referred to the glory of God: Whether you eat or drink, or whatever else you do, do all to the glory of God.




Necessity of the Fourth Petition

In order that the faithful may see the importance of this Petition, the pastor should remind them how much we
stand in need of external things, in order to support and maintain life; and this they will the more easily
understand, if he compares the wants of our first parent with those of his posterity.




Man Needs Many Things For His Bodily Life

It is true that in that exalted state of innocence, from which he himself, and, through his transgression, all his
posterity fell, he had need of food to recruit his strength; yet there is a great difference between his wants and
those to which we are subject. He stood not in need of clothes to cover him, of a house to shelter him, of
weapons to defend him, of medicine to restore health, nor of many other things which are necessary to us for the
protection and preservation of our weak and frail bodies. To enjoy immortality, it would have been sufficient
for him to eat of the fruit which the blessed tree of life yielded without any labor from him or his posterity.




                                                       320
Nevertheless, since he was placed in that habitation of pleasure in order to be occupied, he was not, in the midst
of these delights, to lead a life of indolence. But to him no employment would have been troublesome, no duty
unpleasant. From the cultivation of those beautiful gardens he would always have derived fruits the most
delicious, and his labours and hopes would never have been frustrated.




To Supply His Bodily Wants Man Must Labor

His posterity, on the contrary, are not only deprived of the fruit of the tree of life, but also condemned to this
dreadful sentence: Cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy
life; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth. In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken; for dust thou art, and into
dust thou shalt return.




Without God’s Help Man’s Labor Is Vain

Our condition, therefore, is entirely different from what his and that of his posterity would have been, had
Adam listened to the voice of God. All things have been thrown into disorder, and have changed sadly for the
worse. Of the resultant evils, this is not the least, that the heaviest cost, and labor, and toil, are frequently
expended in vain; either because the crops are unproductive, or because the fruits of the earth are smothered by
noxious weeds that spring up about them, or perish when stricken and prostrated by heavy rains, storms, hail,
blight or blast. Thus is the entire labor of the year quickly reduced to nothing by some calamity of air or soil,
inflicted in punishment of our crimes, which provoke the wrath of God and prevent Him from blessing our
efforts. The dreadful sentence pronounced against us in the beginning remains.

Pastors, therefore, should apply themselves earnestly to the treatment of this subject, in order that the faithful
may know that men fall into these perplexities and miseries through their own fault; that they may understand
that while they must sweat and toil to procure the necessaries of life, unless God bless their labours, their hope
must prove fallacious, and all their exertions unavailing. For neither he that planteth is anything, nor he that
watereth but God who giveth the increase; unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.




Inducements to Use this Petition

Parish priests, therefore, should point out that the things necessary to human existence, or, at least, to its
comfort, are almost innumerable; for by this knowledge of our wants and weaknesses, Christians will be
compelled to have recourse to their heavenly Father, and humbly to ask of Him both earthly and spiritual
blessings.

They will imitate the prodigal son, who, when he began to suffer want in a far distant country, and could find no
one to give him even husks in his hunger, at length entering into himself, perceived that from the evils by which
he was oppressed, he could expect relief from no one but from his father.

Here the faithful will also have recourse more confidently to prayer, if, in reflecting on the goodness of God,
they recollect that His paternal ears are ever open to the cries of His children. When He exhorts us to ask for
bread, He promises to bestow it on us abundantly, if we ask it as we ought; for, by teaching us how to ask, He
exhorts; by exhorting, He urges; by urging, He promises; by promising, He puts us in hope of most certainly
obtaining our request.




                                                         321
"Bread"

When, therefore, the faithful are thus animated and encouraged, (the pastor) should next proceed to declare the
objects of this Petition; and first, what that bread is which we ask.

It should then be known that, in the Sacred Scriptures, by the word bread, are signified many things, but
especially two: first, whatever we use for food and for other corporal wants; secondly, whatever the divine
bounty has bestowed on us for the life and salvation of the soul.




We Ask For Temporal Blessings

In this Petition, then, according to the interpretation and authority of the holy Fathers, we ask those helps of
which we stand in need in this life on earth.




It Is Lawful To Pray For Temporal Blessings

Those, therefore, who say that it is unlawful for Christians to ask from God the earthly goods of this life, are by
no means to be listened to; for not only the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, but also very many examples,
both in the Old and New Testaments, are opposed to this error.

Thus Jacob, making a vow, prayed as follows: If God shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way, by which
I walk, and shall give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, and I shall return prosperously to my father's
house, the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall be called the house of God;
and of all things thou shalt give to me, I will offer up tithes to thee. Solomon also asked a certain means of
subsistence in this life, when he prayed: Give me neither beggary nor riches: give me only the necessaries of
life.

Nay, the Saviour of mankind Himself commands us to pray for those things which no one will dare deny
appertain to the benefit of the body. Pray, He says, that your flight be not in the winter, or on the sabbath. St.
James also says: Is any one of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him, sing. And the Apostle
thus addressed himself to the Romans: I beseech you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the
charity of the Holy Ghost, that you assist me in your prayers for me to God, that l may be delivered front the
unbelievers that are in Judea. As, then, the faithful are divinely permitted to ask these temporal succours, and as
this perfect form of prayer was given us by Christ the Lord, there remains no doubt that such a request
constitutes one of the seven Petitions.




The Wants, Not The Luxuries Of This Life Are Meant By The Word "Bread"

We also ask our daily bread; that is, the things necessary for sustenance, understanding by the word bread, what
is sufficient for raiment and for food, whether that food be bread,- or flesh, or fish, or anything else. In this
sense we find Eliseus to have used the word when admonishing the king to provide bread for the Assyrian
soldiers, to whom was then given a large quantity of various kinds of food. We also know that of Christ the
Lord it is written, that He went into the house of a certain prince of the Pharisees on the sabbath day to eat
bread, by which words we see are signified the things that constitute food and drink.




                                                        322
To comprehend the full signification of this Petition, it is, moreover, to be observed that by this word bread
ought not to be understood an abundant and exquisite profusion of food and clothing, but what is necessary and
simple, as the Apostle has written: Having food and wherewith to he covered, with these we are content; and
Solomon, as said above: Give me only the necessaries of life.




"Our"

Of this frugality and moderation we are admonished in the next word; for when we say our, we ask for bread
sufficient to satisfy our necessities, not to gratify luxury.

We do not say our in the sense that we are able of ourselves, and independently of God, to procure bread; for we
read in David: All expect of thee that thou give them food in season: when thou givest to them they shall gather
up: when thou openest thy hand they shall all be filled with good; and in another place, The eyes of all hope in
thee, O Lord, and thou givest them meat in due season. (We say our bread, then), because it is necessary for us
and is given to us by God, the Father of all, who, by His providence, feeds all living creatures.

It is-also called our bread for this reason, that it is to be acquired by us lawfully, not by injustice, fraud or theft.
What we procure in evil ways is not our own, but the property of another. Its acquisition or possession, or, at
least, its loss, is generally calamitous; while, on the contrary, there is in the honest and laborious gains of good
men peace and great happiness, according to these words of the Prophet: For thou shalt eat the labours of thy
hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. Indeed to those who seek subsistence by honest labor,
God promises the fruit of His kindness in the following passage: The Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy
storehouses, and upon all the works of thy hands, and will bless thee.

Not only do we beg of God to grant us to use, with the aid of His goodness, the fruit of our virtuous toil -- and
that is truly called ours -- but we also pray for a good mind, that we may be able well and prudently to use what
we have honestly acquired.




"Daily"

By the word (daily) also is suggested the idea of frugality and moderation, to which we referred a short time
ago; for we pray not for variety or delicacy of food, but for that which may satisfy the wants of nature. This
should bring the blush of shame to those who, disdaining ordinary food and drink, look for the rarest viands and
wines.

Nor by this word daily are they less censured to whom Isaias holds out those awful threats: Woe to you that join
house to house, and lay field to field, even to the end of the place: shall you alone dwell in the midst of the
earth? Indeed the cupidity of such men is insatiable, and it is of them that Solomon has written: A covetous man
shall-not be satisfied with money. To them also applies that saying of the Apostle: They who would become
rich fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil.

We also call it our daily bread, because we use it to recruit the vital power that is daily consumed by the natural
heat of the system.

Finally, another reason for the use of the word daily is the necessity of continually praying to God, in order that
we may be kept in the practice of loving and serving Him, and that we may be thoroughly convinced of the fact
that on Him depend our life and salvation.




                                                          323
"Give"

With regard to the two words give us, what ample matter they supply for exhorting the faithful piously and
holily to worship and revere the infinite power of God, in whose hands are all things, and to detest that
abominable boast of Satan: To me all things are delivered, and to whom I will I give them, must be obvious to
everyone. For it is by the sovereign will of God alone that all things are dispensed, and preserved, and
increased.

But what necessity, some one may say, is there imposed on the rich to pray for their daily bread, seeing that
they abound in all things? They are under the necessity of praying thus, not that those things be given them
which by the goodness of God they have in abundance, but that they may not lose their possessions. Hence the
Apostle writes that the rich should learn from this not to be highminded, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in
the living God, who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy.

St. Chrysostom adduces as a reason for the necessity of this Petition, not only that we may be supplied with
food, but that we be supplied with it by the hand of the Lord, which imparts to our daily bread so wholesome
and salutary an influence as to render the food profitable to the body, and the body subject to the soul.




"us"

But why say give us, in the plural number, and not give me? Because it is the duty of Christian charity that each
individual be not solicitous for himself alone, but that he be also active in the cause of his neighbour; and that,
while he attends to his own interests, he forget not the interests of others.

Moreover, the gifts which are bestowed by God on anyone are given, not that he alone should possess them, or
that he should live luxuriously in their enjoyment, but that he should impart his superfluities to others. For, as
St. Basil and St. Ambrose say, It is the bread of the hungry that you withhold; it is the clothes of the naked that
you lock up; that money you bury under ground is the redemption, the freedom of the wretched.




"This Day"

The words this day remind us of our common infirmity. For who is there that, although he does not expect to be
able by his own individual exertions to provide for his maintenance during a considerable time does not feel
confident of having it in his power to procure necessary food for the day? Yet even this confidence God will not
permit us to entertain, but has commanded us to ask Him for the food even of each successive day; and the
necessary reason is, that as we all stand in need of daily bread, each should also make daily use of the Lord's
Prayer.

So far we have spoken of the bread which we eat and which nourishes and supports the body; which is common
to believers and unbelievers, to pious and impious, and is bestowed on all by the admirable bounty of God, Who
maketh his sun to rise on the good and the bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.




The Spiritual Bread Asked for in this Petition

It remains to speak of the spiritual bread which we also ask in this Petition, by which are meant all things
whatever that are required in this life for the health and safety of the spirit and soul. For as the food by which




                                                        324
the body is nourished and supported is of various sorts, so is the food which preserves the life of the spirit and
soul not of one kind.




The Word Of God Is Our Spiritual Bread

The Word of God is the food of the soul, as Wisdom says: Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have
mingled for you. And when God deprives men of the means of hearing His Word, which He is wont to do when
grievously provoked by our crimes, He is said to visit the human race with famine; for we thus read in Amos: I
will send forth a famine into the land, not a famine of bread, or a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the
Lord.

And as an incapability of taking food, or of retaining it when taken, is a sure sign of approaching death, so is it a
strong argument for their hopelessness of salvation, when men either seek not the Word of God, or, having it,
endure it not, but utter against God the impious cry, Depart from us, We desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
This is the spiritual folly and mental blindness of those who, disregarding their lawful pastors, the Catholic
Bishops and priests, and, abandoning the Holy Roman Church, have transferred themselves to the direction of
heretics that corrupt the Word of God.




Christ Is Our Spiritual Bread, Especially In The Holy Eucharist

Now Christ the Lord is that bread which is the food of the soul. I am, He says of Himself, the living bread
which came down from heaven. It is incredible with what pleasure and delight this bread fills devout souls, even
when they must contend with earthly troubles and disasters. Of this we have an example in the Apostles, of
whom it is written: They, indeed, went into the presence of the council rejoicing. The lives of the Saints are full
of similar examples; and of these inward joys of the good, God thus speaks: To him that overcometh, I will give
the hidden manna.

But Christ the Lord is especially our bread in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, in which He is substantially
contained. This ineffable pledge of His love He gave us when about to return to the Father, and of it He said: He
that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him, Take ye and eat: this is my body. For
matter useful to the faithful on this subject the pastor should consult what we have already said on the nature
and efficacy of this Sacrament.

The Eucharist is called our bread, because it is the food of the faithful only, that is to say, of those who, uniting
charity to faith, wash away the defilement of their sins in the Sacrament of Penance, and mindful that they are
the children of God, receive and adore this divine Sacrament with all possible holiness and veneration.




Why The Holy Eucharist Is Called Our "Daily" Bread

The Eucharist is called daily (bread) for two reasons. The first is that it is daily offered to God in the sacred
mysteries of the Christian Church and is given to those who seek it piously and holily. The second is that it
should be received daily, or, at least, that we should so live as to be worthy, as far as possible, to receive it
daily. Let those who hold the contrary, and who say that we should not partake of this salutary banquet of the
soul but at distant intervals, hear what St. Ambrose says: If it is daily bread, why do you receive it yearly?




                                                         325
Exhortations

In the explanation of this Petition the faithful are emphatically to be exhorted that when they have honestly used
their best judgment and industry to procure the necessary means of subsistence, they leave the issue to God and
submit their own wish to the will of Him who shall not suffer the just to waver for ever. For God will either
grant what is asked, and thus they will obtain their wishes; or He will not grant it, and that will be a most certain
proof that what is denied the good by Him is not conducive either to their interest or their salvation, since He is
more desirous of their eternal welfare than they themselves. This topic the pastor will be able to amplify, by
explaining the reasons admirably collected by St. Augustine in his letter to Proba.

In concluding his explanation of this Petition the pastor should exhort the rich to remember that they are to look
upon their wealth and riches as gifts of God, and to reflect that those goods are bestowed on them in order that
they may share them with the indigent. With this truth the words of the Apostle, in his First Epistle to Timothy,'
will be found to accord, and will supply parish priests with an abundance of matter wherewith to elucidate this
subject in a useful and profitable manner.




  THE FIFTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
                                     debtors"




The Importance Of Explaining This Petition

So many are the things which display at once God's infinite power and His equally infinite wisdom and
goodness, that wheresoever we turn our eyes or direct our thoughts, we meet with the most certain signs of
omnipotence and benignity. And yet there is truly nothing that more eloquently proclaims His supreme love and
admirable charity towards us, than the inexplicable mystery of the Passion of Jesus Christ, whence springs that
never-failing fountain to wash away the defilements of sin. (It is this fountain) in which, under the guidance and
bounty of God, we desire to be merged and purified, when we beg of Him to forgive us our debts.

This Petition contains a sort of summary of those benefits with which the human race has been enriched through
Jesus Christ. This Isaias taught when he said: The iniquity of the house of Jacob shall be forgiven; and this is all
the fruit, that the sin thereof should be taken away. David also shows this, proclaiming those blessed who could
partake of that salutary fruit: Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.

The pastor, therefore, should study and explain accurately and diligently the meaning of this Petition, which, we
perceive, is so important to the attainment of salvation.




Difference Between This And The Preceding Petitions

In this Petition we enter on a new manner of praying. For hitherto we asked of God not only eternal and
spiritual goods, but also transient and temporal advantages; whereas, we now ask to be freed from the evils of
the soul and of the body, of this life and of the life to come.




Dispositions with which this petition should be Offered




                                                        326
Since, however, to obtain what we ask we must pray in a becoming manner, it appears expedient to explain the
disposition with which this prayer should be offered to God.




Acknowledgment Of Sin

The pastor, then, should admonish the faithful, that he who comes to offer this Petition must first acknowledge,
and next feel sorrow and compunction for his sins. He must also be firmly convinced that to sinners, thus
disposed and prepared, God is willing to grant pardon. This confidence is necessary to sinners, lest perhaps the
bitter remembrance and acknowledgment of their sins should be followed by that despair of pardon, which of
old seized the mind of Cain and of Judas, both of whom looked on God solely as an avenger and punisher,
forgetting that He is also mild and merciful.

In this Petition, therefore, we ought to be so disposed, that, acknowledging our sins in the bitterness of our
souls, we may fly to God as to a Father, not as to a Judge, imploring Him to deal with us not according to His
justice, but according to His mercy.

We shall be easily induced to acknowledge our sins if we listen to God Himself admonishing us through the
Sacred Scriptures in this regard. Thus we read in David: They are all gone aside; they are become unprofitable
together; there is none that doeth good, no not one. Solomon speaks to the same purpose: There is no just man
upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not. To this subject apply also these words: Who can say: "my heart is
clean, I am pure from sin?" The very same has been written by St. John to deter men from arrogance: If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Jeremias also says: Thou hast said: "I am
without sin, and am innocent"; and therefore, let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will contend with
thee in judgment, because thou hast said: "I have not sinned."

Christ the Lord, who spoke by the mouth of all these, confirms their teaching by this Petition in which He
commands us to confess our sins. The Council of Milevi forbids us to interpret it otherwise. It hath pleased the
Council, that whosoever will have it that these words of the Lord's prayer, "forgive us our debts," are said by
holy men in humility, not in truth, let him be anathema. For who can endure a person praying, and lying not to
men, but to the Lord Himself, saying with the lips that he desires to be forgiven, but with the heart, that he has
no debts to be forgiven ?




Sorrow For Sin

In making this necessary acknowledgment of our sins, it is Dot enough to call them to mind lightly; for it is
necessary that the recollection of them be bitter, that it touch the heart, pierce the soul, and imprint sorrow.
Wherefore, the pastor should treat this point diligently, that his pious hearers may not only recollect their sins,
and iniquities, but recollect them with pain and sorrow; so that with true interior contrition they may betake
themselves to God their Father, humbly imploring Him to pluck from the soul the piercing stings of sin.




Motives For Sorrow Over Sin: The Baseness Of Sin

The pastor, however, should not be content with placing before the eyes of the faithful the turpitude of sin. He
should also depict the unworthiness and baseness of men, who, though nothing but rottenness and corruption,
dare to outrage in a manner beyond all belief the incomprehensible majesty and ineffable excellence of God,
particularly after having been created, redeemed and enriched by Him with countless and invaluable benefits.




                                                        327
The Consequences Of Sin

And for what? Only for this, that separating ourselves from God our Father, who is the supreme Good, and
lured by the most base rewards of sin, we may devote ourselves to the devil, to become his most wretched
slaves. Language is inadequate to depict the cruel tyranny which the devil exercises over those who, having
shaken off the sweet yoke of God, and broken the most lovely bond of charity by which our spirit is bound to
God our Father, have gone over to their relentless enemy, who is therefore called in Scripture, the prince and
ruler of the world, the prince of darkness, and king over all the children of pride. Truly to those who are
oppressed by the tyranny of the devil apply these words of Isaias: O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have
had dominion over us.

If these broken covenants of love do not move us, let at least the calamities into which we fall by sin move us.
The sanctity of the soul is violated, which we know to have been wedded to Christ. That temple of the Lord is
profaned, against the contaminators of which the Apostle utters this denunciation: If any man violate the temple
of God, him shall God destroy.

Innumerable are the evils brought upon man by sin, that almost infinite pest of which David says: There is no
health in my flesh, because of thy wrath; there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins. In these words he
marks the violence of the plague, confessing that it left no part of him uninfected by pestiferous sin; for the
poison had penetrated into his bones, that is, it infected his understanding and will, which are the two most
intimate faculties of the soul. This widespread pestilence the Sacred Scriptures point out, when they designate
sinners as the lame, the deaf, the dumb, the blind, the paralysed.

But,- besides the anguish which he felt on account of the enormity of his sins, David was afflicted yet more by
the knowledge that he had provoked the wrath of God against him by his sin. For the wicked are at war with
God, who is offended beyond belief at their crimes; hence the Apostle says: Wrath and indignation, tribulation
and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil. Although the sinful act is transient, yet the sin by its guilt
and stain remains; and the imminent wrath of God pursues it, as the shadow does the body.

When, therefore, David was pierced by these tormenting thoughts, he was moved to seek the pardon of his sins.
That the faithful, imitating the Prophet, may learn to grieve, that is, to become truly penitent, and cherish the
hope of pardon, the pastor should call to their attention the example of David's penitential sorrow, and the
lessons of instruction drawn from his fiftieth Psalm.

How great is the utility of this sort of instruction, which teaches us to grieve for our sins, God Himself declares
by the mouth of Jeremias, who, when exhorting the Israelites to repentance, admonished them to awake to a
sense of the evils that follow upon sin. See, he says, that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the
Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord, the God of hosts. They who lack this necessary
sense of acknowledgment and grief, are said by the Prophets Isaias, Ezechiel and Zachary to have a hard heart, a
stony heart, a heart of adamant, for, like stone, they are softened by no sorrow, having no sense of life, that is,
of the salutary recognition (of their sinfulness).




Confidence In God's Mercy

But lest the faithful, terrified by the grievousness of their sins, despair of being able to obtain pardon, the pastor
ought to encourage them to hope by the following considerations.

As is declared in an Article of the Creed, Christ the Lord has given power to the Church to remit sins.




                                                         328
Furthermore, in this Petition, our Lord has taught how great is the goodness and bounty of God towards
mankind; for if God were not ready and prepared to pardon penitents their sins, never would He have prescribed
this formula of prayer: Forgive us our trespass. Wherefore we ought to be firmly convinced, that since He
commands us in this Petition to implore His paternal mercy, He will not fail to bestow it on us. For this Petition
assuredly implies that God is so disposed towards us, as willingly to pardon those who are truly penitent.

God it is against whom, having cast off obedience, we sin; the order of whose wisdom we disturb, as far as in us
lies; whom we offend; whom we outrage by words and deeds. But it is also God, our most beneficent Father,
who, having it in His power to pardon all transgressions, has not only declared His willingness to do so, but has
also obliged men to ask Him for pardon, and has taught in what words they are to do so. To no one, therefore,
can it be a matter of doubt, that under His guidance it is in our power to be reconciled to God. And as this
declaration of the divine willingness to pardon increases faith, nurtures hope and inflames charity, it will be
worth while to amplify this subject, by citing some Scriptural authorities and some examples of penitents to
whom God granted pardon of the most grievous crimes. Since, however, in the introduction to the Lord's Prayer
and in that portion of the Creed which teaches the forgiveness of sins, we were as diffuse on the subject as
circumstances allowed, the pastor will borrow from those places whatever may seem pertinent for instruction on
this point, for the rest drawing on the fountains of the Sacred Scriptures.




"Debts"

The pastor should also follow the same plan which we thought should be used in the other Petitions. Let him
explain, then, what the word debts here signifies, lest perhaps the faithful, deceived by its ambiguity, pray for
something different from what should be prayed for.

First, then, we are to know, that we by no means ask for exemption from the debt we owe to God on so many
accounts, the payment of which is essential to salvation, namely, that of loving Him with our whole heart, our
whole soul, and our whole mind; neither do we ask to be in future exempt from the duties of obedience,
worship, veneration, or any other similar obligation, comprised also under the word debts.

What we do ask is that He may deliver us from sins. This is the interpretation of St. Luke, who, instead of debts,
makes use of the word sins, because by their commission we become guilty before God and incur a debt of
punishment, which we must pay either by satisfaction or by suffering. It was of this debt that Christ the Lord
spoke by the mouth of His Prophet: Then did I pay that which I took not away. From these words of God we
may understand that we are not only debtors, but also unequal to the payment of our debt, the sinner being of
himself utterly incapable of making satisfaction.

Wherefore we must fly to the mercy of God; and as justice, of which God is most tenacious, is an equal and
corresponding attribute to mercy, we must make use of prayer, and the intercession of the Passion of our Lord
Jesus Christ, without which no one ever obtained the pardon of his sins, and from which, as from its source,
have flown all the efficacy and virtue of satisfaction. For of such value is that price paid by Christ the Lord on
the cross, and communicated to us through the Sacraments, received either actually or in purpose and desire,
that it obtains and accomplishes for us the pardon of our sins, which is the object of our prayer in this Petition.

Here we ask pardon not only for our venial offences, for which pardon may most easily be obtained, but also for
grievous and mortal sins. With regard to grave sins, however, this Petition cannot procure forgiveness unless it
derive that efficacy from the Sacrament of Penance, received, as we have already said, either actually or at least
in desire.'




"Our"



                                                        329
The words our debts are used here in a sense entirely different from that in which we said our bread. That bread
is ours, because it is given us by the munificence of God; whereas sins are ours, because with us rests their guilt.
They are our voluntary acts, otherwise they would not have the character of sin.

Admitting, therefore, and confessing the guilt of our sins, we implore the clemency of God, which is necessary
for their expiation. In this we make use of no palliation whatever, nor do we transfer the blame to others, as did
our first parents Adam and Eve. We judge ourselves, employing, if we are wise, the prayer of the Prophet:
Incline not my heart to evil words, to make excuses in sins.




"Forgive Us"

Nor do we say, forgive me, but forgive us; because the fraternal relationship and charity which subsist between
all men, demand of each of us that, being solicitous for the salvation of all our neighbours, we pray also for
them while offering prayers for ourselves.

This manner of praying, taught by Christ the Lord, and subsequently received and always retained by the
Church of God, the Apostles most strictly observed themselves and taught others to observe.

Of this ardent zeal and earnestness in praying for the salvation of our neighbours, we have the splendid example
of Moses in the Old, and of St. Paul in the New Testament. The former besought God thus: Either forgive them
this trespass; or, if thou dost not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written; ' while the latter prayed after
this manner: I wished myself to be anathema from Christ for my brethren.




"As we Forgive our Debtors"

The word as may be understood in two senses. It may be taken as having the force of a comparison, meaning
that we beg of God to pardon us our sins, just as we pardon the wrongs and contumelies which we receive from
those by whom we have been injured. It may also be understood as denoting a condition, and in this sense
Christ the Lord interprets that formula. If, He says, you forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you your offences; but if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your sins.

Either sense, however, equally contains the necessity of forgiveness, intimating, as it does that, if we desire that
God should grant us the pardon of our offences, we ourselves must pardon those from whom we have received
injury; for so rigorously does God exact from us forgetfulness of injuries and mutual affection and love, that He
rejects and despises the gifts and sacrifices of those who are not reconciled to one another.




Necessity Of Forgiveness

Even the law of nature requires that we conduct ourselves towards others as we would have them conduct
themselves towards us; hence he would be most impudent who would ask of God the pardon of his own
offences while he continued to cherish enmity against his neighbour.

Those, therefore, on whom injuries have been inflicted, should be ready and willing to pardon, urged to it as
they are by this form of prayer, and by the command of God in St. Luke: If thy brother sin against thee, reprove
him; and if he repent, forgive him; and if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn
again to thee, saying, "I repent," forgive him. In the Gospel of St. Matthew we read: Love your enemies; and the
Apostle, and before him Solomon wrote: If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink;


                                                         330
and finally we read in the Gospel of St. Mark: When you shall stand to pray, forgive if you have anything
against any man; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your sins.




Reasons For Forgiveness

But since, on account of the corruption of nature, there is nothing to which man brings himself more reluctantly
than to the pardon of injuries, let pastors exert all the powers and resources of their minds to change and bend
the dispositions of the faithful to this mildness and mercy so necessary to a Christian. Let them dwell on those
passages of Scripture in which we hear God commanding to pardon enemies.

Let them also insist on this certain truth, that one of the surest signs that men are children of God is their
willingness-to forgive injuries and sincerely love their enemies; for in loving our enemies there shines forth in
us some likeness to God our Father, who, by the death of His Son, ransomed from everlasting perdition and
reconciled to Himself the human race, which before was most unfriendly and hostile to Him.

Let the close of this exhortation and injunction be the command of Christ the Lord, which, without utter
disgrace and ruin, we cannot refuse to obey: Pray for them that persecute and calumniate you; that you may be
the children of your Father who is in heaven.




This Petition Should Not be Neglected

But in this matter no ordinary prudence is required on the part of the pastor, lest, knowing the difficulty and
necessity of this precept, anyone despair of salvation.




Those Unable To Forget Injuries

There are those who, aware that they ought to bury injuries in voluntary oblivion and ought to love those that
injure them, desire to do so, and do so as far as they are able, but feel that they cannot efface from their mind all
recollection of injuries. For there lurk in the mind some remains of private grudge, in consequence of which
such persons are disturbed by misgivings of conscience, fearing that they have not in simplicity and frankness
laid aside their enmities and consequently do not obey the command of God.

Here, therefore, the pastor should explain the contrary desires of the flesh and of the spirit; that the former is
prone to revenge, the latter ready to pardon; that hence a continual struggle and conflict goes on between them.
Wherefore he should point out that although the appetites of corrupt nature are ever opposing and rebelling
against reason, we are not on this account to be uneasy regarding salvation, provided the spirit persevere in the
duty and disposition of forgiving injuries and of loving our neighbour.




Those Who Do Not Love Their Enemies

There may be some who, because they have not yet been able to bring themselves to forget injuries and to love
their enemies, are consequently deterred by the condition contained in this Petition from making use of the
Lord's Prayer. To remove from their minds this pernicious error, the pastor should adduce the two following
considerations.



                                                        331
(In the first place), whoever belongs to the number of the faithful, offers this prayer in the name of the entire
Church, in which there must necessarily be some pious persons who have forgiven their debtors the debts here
mentioned.

Secondly, when we ask this favour from God, we also ask for whatever cooperation with the Petition is
necessary on our part in order to obtain the object of our prayer. Thus we ask the pardon of our sins and the gift
of true repentance; we pray for the grace of inward sorrow; we beg that we may be able to abhor our sins, and
confess them truly and piously to the priest. Since, then, it is necessary for us to forgive those who have
inflicted on us any loss or injury, when we ask pardon of God we beg of Him at the same time to grant us grace
to be reconciled to those against whom we harbour hatred.

Those, therefore, who are troubled by that groundless and perverse fear, that by this prayer they provoke still
more the wrath of God, should be undeceived and should be exhorted to make frequent use of a prayer in which
they beseech God our Father to grant them the disposition to forgive those who have injured them and to love
their enemies.




How to Make this Petition Fruitful




Penitential Dispositions

But that this Petition may be really fruitful we should first seriously reflect that we are suppliants before God,
soliciting from Him pardon, which is not granted but to the penitent; and that we should, therefore, be animated
by that charity and piety which are fitting in penitents, whom it eminently becomes to keep before their eyes, as
it were, their own crimes and enormities and to expiate them with tears.




Avoidance Of Dangers Of Sin

To this thought should be joined caution in guarding for the future against every occasion of sin, and against
whatever I nay expose us to the danger of offending God our Father. With this solicitude the mind of David was
occupied when he said: My sin is always before me; and: Every night I will wash my bed; I will water my
couch with my tears.




Imitation Of Fervent Penitents

Let each one also call to mind the ardent love of prayer of those who obtained from God through their entreaties
the pardon of their sins. Such was the publican, who, standing afar off through shame and grief, and with eyes
fixed on the ground, only smote his breast, crying: O God, be merciful to me, a sinner. Such was also the
woman, a sinner, who, standing behind Christ the Lord, washed His feet, wiped them with her hair, and kissed
them. Lastly, there is the example of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, who going forth wept bitterly.




Frequent Use Of The Sacraments




                                                       332
They should next consider that the weaker men are, and the more liable to diseases of the soul, which are sins,
the more numerous and frequent are the remedies they need. Now the remedies of a sick soul are Penance and
the Eucharist; these, therefore, the faithful should frequently make use of.




Almsdeeds

Next almsdeeds, as the Sacred Scriptures declare, are a medicine suited to heal the wounds of the soul.
Wherefore, let those who desire to make pious use of this prayer act kindly to the poor according to their means.
Of the great efficacy of alms in effacing the stains of sin, the Angel of the Lord in Tobias, holy Raphael, is a
witness, who says: Alms deliver from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find
mercy and life everlasting. Daniel is another witness, who thus admonished King Nabuchodonosor: Redeem
thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor.




The Spirit Of Forgiveness

The best alms and the most excellent act of mercy is forgetfulness of injuries, and good will towards those who
have injured us or ours, in person, in property, or in character. Whoever, therefore, desires to experience in a
special manner the mercy of God, should make an offering to God Himself of all his enmities, remit every
offence, and pray for his enemies with the greatest good will, seizing every opportunity of doing them good.
But as this subject was explained when we treated of murder, we refer the pastor to that place.

The pastor ought to conclude his explanation of this Petition with this final reflection, that nothing is, or can be
conceived, more unjust than that he who is so rigorous towards men as to extend indulgence to no one, should
himself demand that God be mild and kind towards him.




        THE SIXTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "And lead us not into temptation."




Importance Of Instruction On This Petition

When the children of God, having obtained the pardon of their sins, are inflamed with the desire of giving to
God worship and veneration; when they long for the kingdom of heaven; when they engage in the performance
of all the duties of piety towards the Deity, relying entirely on His paternal will and providence, -- then it is that
the enemy of mankind employs the more actively all his artifices, and prepares all his resources to attack them
so violently as to justify the fear that, wavering and altered in their sentiments, they may relapse into sin, and
thus become far worse than they had been before. To such as these may justly be applied the saying of the
Prince of the Apostles: It had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, than, after they have
known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them.

Hence Christ the Lord has commanded us to offer this Petition so that we may commend ourselves daily to
God, and implore His paternal care and assistance, being assured that, if we be deserted by the divine
protection, we shall soon fall into the snares of our most crafty enemy.

Nor is it in the Lord's Prayer alone that He has commanded us to beg of God not to suffer us to be led into
temptation. In His address to the holy Apostles also, on the very eve of His death, after He had declared them
clean, He admonished them of this duty in these words: Pray that ye enter not into temptation.


                                                         333
This admonition, reiterated by Christ the Lord, imposes on the pastor the weighty obligation of exciting the
faithful to a frequent use of this prayer, so that, beset as men constantly are by the great dangers which the devil
prepares, they may ever ad dress to God, who alone can repel those dangers, the prayer, Lead us not into
temptation.'




Necessity of the Sixth Petition




Human Frailty

The faithful will understand how very much they stand in need of this divine assistance, if they remember their
own weakness and ignorance, if they recollect this saying of Christ the Lord: The spirit indeed is willing, but
the flesh is weak; if they call to mind how grievous and destructive are the misfortunes of men brought on
through the instigation of the devil, unless they be upheld and assisted by the right hand of the Most High.

What more striking example can there be of human infirmity, than the holy band of the Apostles, who, though
they had just before felt very courageous, at the first sight of danger, abandoned the Saviour and fled. A still
more conspicuous example is the conduct of the Prince of the Apostles. He who a short time before loudly
protested his courage and special loyalty to Christ the Lord, he who had been so confident in himself as to say,
Though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee, became so affrighted at the voice of a poor maid-servant
that he declared at once with an oath that he knew not the Lord. Doubtless his courage was not equal to his
good-will. But if, by the frailty of human nature in which they confided, even the Saints have sinned grievously,
what have not others to fear, who are so far below them in holiness?




The Assaults Of The Flesh

Wherefore, let the pastor remind the faithful of the conflicts and dangers in which we are continually engaged,
as long as the soul is in this mortal body, assailed as we are on all sides by the world, the flesh and the devil.

How few are there who are not compelled to experience at their great cost what anger, what concupiscence can
do in us? Who is not annoyed by these stings? who does not feel these goads? who does not burn with these
smouldering fires? And, indeed, so various are these assaults, so diversified these attacks, that it is extremely
difficult not to receive some grievous wound.




The Temptations Of The Devil

And besides these enemies that dwell and live with us, there are, moreover, those most bitter foes, of whom it is
written: Our wrestling is not against, flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of
the world' of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places. For to our inward conflicts are
added the external assaults and attacks of the demons, who both assail us openly, and also insinuate themselves
by stratagem into our souls, so much so that it is only with great difficulty that we can escape them.

The Apostle entitles the demons princes, on account of the excellence of their nature, since by nature they are
superior to man, and to all other visible creatures. He also calls them powers, because they excel not only by
their nature, but also by their power. He designates them rulers of the world of darkness, because they rule not
the world of light and glory, that is to say, the good and the pious, but the world of gloom and darkness, namely,


                                                        334
those who, blinded by the defilement and darkness of a wicked life, are satisfied to have for their leader the
devil, the prince of darkness. He also terms the demons the spirits of wickedness, because there is a wickedness
of the spirit, as well as of the flesh. What is called the wickedness of the flesh inflames the appetite to lusts and
pleasures, which are perceived by the senses; while the wickedness of the spirit are evil purposes and depraved
desires, which belong to the superior part of the soul, and which are so much worse than the wickedness of the
flesh as mind itself and reason are higher and more excellent (than the senses). The wickedness of Satan the
Apostle spoke of as in the high places, because the chief aim of the evil one is to deprive us of our heavenly
inheritance.




Audacity Of The Demons

From all this we may understand that the power of these enemies is great, their courage undaunted, their hatred
of us enormous and unmeasured; that they also wage against us a perpetual war, so that with them there can be
no peace, no truce.

How great is their audacity is evidenced by the words of Satan, recorded by the Prophet: I will ascend into
heaven. He attacked our first parents in Paradise; he assailed the Prophets; he beset the Apostles in order, as the
Lord says in the Gospel, that he might sift them as wheat.' Nor was he abashed even by the presence of Christ
the Lord Himself. His insatiable desire and unwearied diligence St. Peter therefore expressed when he said:
Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion goeth about, seeking whom he may devour.




Number Of The Demons

But it is not Satan alone that tempts men, for sometimes a host of demons combine to attack an individual. This
that evil spirit confessed, who, having been asked his name by Christ the Lord, replied, My name is legion; that
is to say, a multitude of demons, tormented their unhappy victim. And of another demon it is written: He taketh
with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.




Malignity And Power Of The Demons

There are many who, because they do not feel the assaults of demons against them, imagine that the whole
matter is fictitious; nor is it surprising that such persons are not attacked by demons, to whom they have
voluntarily surrendered themselves. They possess neither piety nor charity, nor any virtue worthy of a Christian;
hence they are entirely in the power of the devil, and there is no need of any temptation to overcome them, since
their souls have already become his willing abode.

But those who have dedicated themselves to God, leading a heavenly life upon earth, are the chief objects of the
assaults of Satan. Against them he harbours bitterest hatred, laying snares for them each moment. Sacred
Scripture is full of examples of holy men who, in spite of their firmness and resolution, were perverted by his
violence or fraud. Adam, David, Solomon and others, whom it would be tedious to enumerate, experienced the
violent and crafty cunning of demons, which neither human prudence nor human strength can overcome.




Prayer Protects Man's Weakness Against The Enemies Of His Soul




                                                        335
Who, then, can deem himself sufficiently secure in his own resources? Hence the necessity of offering to God
pure and pious prayer, that He suffer us not to be tempted above our strength, but make issue with temptation,
that we may be able to bear it.

But should any of the faithful, through weakness or ignorance, feel terrified at the power of the demons, they
are to be encouraged, when tossed by the waves of temptation, to take refuge in this harbour of prayer. For
however great the power and pertinacity of Satan, he cannot, in his deadly hatred of our race, tempt or torment
us as much, or as long as he pleases; but all his power is governed by the control and permission of God. The
example of Job is very well known. Satan could have touched nothing belonging to him, if God had not said to
the devil: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; while on the other hand, had not the Lord added: Only put not
forth thy hand upon his person, Job with his children and possessions, would have been at once destroyed by the
devil. So restricted is the power of demons, that without the permission of God, they could not even enter into
the swine mentioned by the Evangelists.




"Temptation"

To understand the meaning of this Petition, it is necessary to say what temptation signifies here, and also what it
is to be led into temptation.

To tempt is to sound a person in order that by eliciting from him what we desire, we may extract the truth. This
mode of tempting does not apply to God; for what is there that God does not know? All things are naked and
open to his eyes.

Another kind of tempting implies more than this? inasmuch as it may have either a good or a bad purpose.
Temptation has a good purpose, when someone's worth is tried, in order that when it has been tested and proved
he may be rewarded and honoured, his example proposed to others for imitation, and all may be incited thereby
to the praises of God. This is the only kind of tempting that can be found in God. Of it there is an example in
Deuteronomy: The Lord your God tries you, that it may appear whether you love him or not.

In this manner God is also said to tempt His own, when He visits them with want, disease and other sorts of
calamities. This He does to try their patience, and to make them an example of Christian virtue. Thus we read
that Abraham was tempted to immolate his son, by which fact he became a singular example of obedience and
patience to all succeeding times. Thus also is it written of Tobias: Because thou wast acceptable to God, it was
necessary that temptation should prove thee.

Men are tempted for a bad purpose, when they are impelled to sin or destruction. To do this is the work of the
devil, for he tempts men with a view to deceive and precipitate them into ruin, and he is therefore called in
Scripture, the tempter At one time, stimulating us from within, he employs the agency of the affections and
passions of the soul. At another time, assailing us from without, he makes use of external things, as of
prosperity, to puff us up with pride, or of adversity, to break our spirits. Sometimes he has for his emissaries and
assistants abandoned men, particularly heretics, who, sitting in the chair of pestilence, scatter the deadly seeds
of bad doctrines, thus unsettling and precipitating headlong those persons who draw no line of distinction
between vice and virtue and are of themselves prone to evil.




"Lead us not into Temptation"

We are said to be led into temptation when we yield to temptations. Now this happens in two ways. First, we are
led into temptation when, yielding to suggestion, we rush into that evil to which some one tempts us. No one is
thus led into temptation by God; for to no one is God the author of sin, nay, He hates all who work iniquity; and



                                                       336
accordingly we also read in St. James: Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted of God; for God
is not a tempter of evils.

Secondly, we are said to be led into temptation by him who, although he himself does not tempt us nor
cooperate in tempting us, yet is said to tempt because he does not prevent us from being tempted or from being
overcome by temptations when he is able to prevent these things. In this manner God, indeed, suffers the good
and the pious to be tempted, but does not leave them unsupported by His grace. Sometimes, however, we fall,
being left to ourselves by the just and secret judgment of God, in punishment of our sins.

God is also said to lead us into temptation when we abuse, to our destruction, His blessings, which He has given
us as a means of salvation; when, like the prodigal son, we squander our Father's substance, living riotously and
yielding to our evil desires. In such a case we can say what the Apostle has said of the law: The commandment
that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.

Of this an opportune example is Jerusalem, as we learn from Ezechiel. God had so enriched that city with every
sort of embellishment, that He said of it by the mouth of the Prophet: Thou wast perfect through my beauty,
which I had put upon thee. Yet Jerusalem, favoured with such an abundance of divine gifts, was so far from
showing gratitude to God, from whom she had received and was still receiving so many favours, was so far
from making use of those heavenly gifts for the attainment of her own happiness, the end for which she had
received them, that having cast away the hope and idea of deriving spiritual profit from them, she, most
ungrateful to God her Father, was content to enjoy her present abundance with a luxury and riotousness which
Ezechiel describes at considerable length in the same chapter. Wherefore those whom God permits to convert
into instruments of vice the abundant opportunities of virtuous deeds which He has afforded them, are equally
ungrateful to Him.

But we ought carefully to notice a certain usage of Sacred Scripture, which sometimes denotes the permission
of God in words which, if taken literally, would imply a positive act on the part of God. Thus in Exodus we
read: I will harden the heart of Pharoah; and in Isaias: Blind the heart of this people; and the Apostle to the
Romans writes: God delivered them up to shameful affections, and to a reprobate sense. In these and other
similar passages we are to understand, not at all any positive act on the part of God, but His permission only.




Objects of the Sixth Petition




What We Do Not Pray For

These observations having been premised, it will not be difficult to understand the object for which we pray in
this Petition.

We do not ask to be totally exempt from temptation, for human life is one continued temptation. This, however,
is useful and advantageous to man. Temptation teaches us to know ourselves, that is, our own weakness, and to
humble ourselves under the powerful hand of God; and by fighting manfully, we expect to receive a never-
fading crown of glory. For he that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he strive lawfully. Blessed is
the man, says St. James, that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of
life, which God hath promised to them that love him. If we are sometimes hard pressed by the temptation of the
enemy, it will also cheer us to reflect, that we have a high priest to help us, who can have compassion on our
infirmities, having been tempted himself in all things.




                                                      337
What We Pray For In This Petition

What, then, do we pray for in this Petition ? We pray that the divine assistance may not forsake us, lest having
been deceived, or worsted, we should yield to temptation; and that the grace of God may be at hand to succour
us when our strength fails, to refresh and invigorate us in our trials.

We should, therefore, implore the divine assistance, in general, against all temptations, and especially when
assailed by any particular temptation. This we find to have been the conduct of David, under almost every
species of temptation. Against lying, he prays in these words: Take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my
mouth; against covetousness: Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness; and against the
vanities of this life and the allurements of concupiscence, he prays thus: Turn away my eyes, that they may not
behold vanity.

We pray, therefore, that we yield not to evil desires, and be not wearied in enduring temptation; that we deviate
not from the way of the Lord; that in adversity, as in prosperity, we preserve equanimity and fortitude; and that
God may never deprive us of His protection. Finally, we pray that God may crush Satan beneath our feet.




Dispositions which should Accompany this Petition

The pastor ought next to admonish the faithful concerning the chief thoughts and reflections that should
accompany this prayer




Distrust Of Self And Confidence In God

It will, then, be found most efficacious, when offering this Petition that, remembering our weakness, we distrust
our own strength; and that, placing all our hopes of safety in the divine goodness and relying on the divine
protection, we encounter the greatest dangers with undaunted courage, calling to mind particularly the many
persons, animated with such hope and resolution, who were delivered by God from the very jaws of Satan.

When Joseph was assailed by the criminal solicitations of a wicked woman, did not God rescue him from the
imminent danger, and exalt him to the highest degree of glory? Did He not preserve Susanna, when beset by the
ministers of Satan, and on the point of being made the victim of an iniquitous sentence? Nor is this surprising;
for her heart, says the Scripture, trusted in the Lord. How exalted the praise, how great the glory of Job, who
triumphed over the world, the flesh and the devil ! There are on record many similar examples to which the
pastor should refer, in order to exhort with earnestness his pious hearers to this hope and confidence.




Remembrance Of The Victory Of Christ And His Saints

The faithful should also reflect who is their leader against the temptations of the enemy; namely, Christ the
Lord, who was victorious in the same combat. He overcame the devil; He is that stronger man who, coming
upon the strong armed man, overcame him, deprived him of his arms, and stripped him of his spoils. Of Christ's
victory over the world, we read in St. John: Have confidence: I have overcome the world; and in the
Apocalypse, He is called the conquering lion; and it is. said of Him that He went forth conquering that He might
conquer, because by His victory He has given power to others to conquer.'

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews abounds with the victories of holy men, who by faith conquered
kingdoms, stopped the mouths of lions, etc. While we read of such achievements, we should also take into


                                                      338
account the victories which are every day won by men eminent for faith, hope and charity, in their interior and
exterior conflicts with the demons, -- victories so numerous and so signal, that, were we spectators of them, we
should deem no event of more frequent occurrence, none of more glorious issue. It was with reference to such
defeats of the enemies that St. John wrote: I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word
of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.'




Watchfulness

Satan, however, is overcome not by indolence, sleep, wine, revelling, or lust; but by prayer, labor, watching,
fasting, continence and chastity. Watch ye and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, as we have already said,
is the admonition of our Lord. They who make use of these weapons in the conflict put the enemy to flight; for
the devil flees from those who resist him.




The Author of victory over Temptation

But from the consideration of these victories achieved by holy men which we have mentioned, let no one
indulge feelings of self-complacency, nor flatter himself that, by his own single unassisted exertions, he is able
to withstand the temptations and hostile assaults of the demons. This is not within the power of human nature,
nor within the capacity of human frailty.

The strength by which we lay prostrate the satellites of Satan comes from God, who maketh our arms as a bow
of brass; by whose aid the bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength; who giveth us
the protection of salvation, whose right hand upholdeth us: who teacheth our hands to war, and our fingers to
battle. Hence to God alone must thanks be given for victory, since it is only through His guidance and help that
we are able to conquer. This the Apostle did; for he said: Thanks to God, who hath given us the victory, through
our Lord Jesus Christ. The voice from heaven, mentioned in the Apocalypse, also proclaims God to be the
author of our victories: Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
Christ; because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth; and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb." The
same book declares that the victory obtained over the world and the flesh belongs to Christ the Lord, when it
says: They shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. But enough has now been said on the
cause and the manner of conquering (temptation).




The Rewards of Victories over temptation

When these things have been explained, the pastor should instruct the faithful concerning the crowns prepared
by God, and the eternal and superabundant rewards reserved for those who conquer. He should quote from the
Apocalypse the following divine promises: He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second death; and in
another place: He that shall overcome, shall thus be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name
out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. A little after, our
divine Lord Himself thus addresses John: He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my
God: and he shall go out no more: and again: To him that shall overcome, I win give to sit with me in my
throne; as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in his throne. Finally, having unveiled the
glory of the Saints, and the never ending bliss which they shall enjoy in heaven, He adds, He that shall
overcome shall possess these things.




                                                       339
           THE SEVENTH PETITION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER : "But deliver us from evil"




The Importance Of Instruction On This Petition

This Petition with which the Son of God concludes this divine prayer embodies the substance of all the other
Petitions. To show its force and importance our Lord made use of this Petition when, on the eve of His Passion,
He prayed to God His Father for the salvation of mankind. I pray, He said, that thou keep them from evil. In this
Petition, then, which He not only commanded us to use, but made use of Himself, He has epitomised, as it were,
the meaning and spirit of all the other Petitions. For if we obtain what this Petition asks, that is, the protection of
God against evil, which enables us to stand secure and safe against the machinations of the world and the devil,
then, as St. Cyprian remarks, nothing more remains to be asked.

Such, then, being the importance of this Petition, the diligence of the pastor in its exposition should be great.
The difference between this and the preceding Petition consists in this, that in the one we beg to avoid sin, in the
other, to escape punishment.




Necessity Of This Petition

It cannot be necessary to remind the faithful of the numerous evils and calamities to which we are exposed, and
how much we stand in need of the divine assistance. The many and serious miseries of human life have been
fully described by sacred and profane writers, and there is hardly any one who has not observed them either in
his own life or in that of others.

We are all convinced of the truth of these words of Job, that model of patience: Man, born of woman, and living
for a short time, is filled with many miseries. He cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a
shadow, and never continueth in the same state. That no day passes without its own trouble or annoyance is
proved by these words of Christ the Lord: Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Indeed, the condition of
human life is pointed out by the Lord Himself, when He admonishes us that we are to take up our cross daily
and follow Him.

Since, therefore, everyone must realise the trials and dangers inseparable from this life, it will not be difficult to
convince the faithful that they ought to implore of God deliverance from evil, since no inducement to prayer
exercises a more powerful influence over men than a desire and hope of deliverance from those evils which
oppress or threaten them. There is in the heart of everyone a natural inclination to have instant recourse to God
in the face of danger, as it is written: Fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek thy name, Lord.




How this Petition should be Made

If, then, in calamities and dangers the unbidden impulse of nature prompts men to call on God, it surely
becomes the duty of those to whose fidelity and prudence their salvation is entrusted to instruct them carefully
in the proper performance of this duty.

WE SHOULD SEEK FIRST THE GLORY OF GOD

For there are some who, contrary to the command of Christ, reverse the order of this prayer. He who commands
us to have recourse to Him in the day of tribulation, has also prescribed to us the order in which we should pray.
It is His will that, before we pray to be delivered from evil, we ask that the name of God be sanctified, that His


                                                         340
kingdom come, and so on through the other Petitions, which are, as it were, so many steps by which we reach
this last Petition.

Yet there are those who, if their head, their side, or their foot, ache; if they suffer loss of property; if menaces or
dangers from an enemy alarm them; if famine, war or pestilence afflict them, omit all the other Petitions of the
Lord's Prayer and ask only to be delivered from these evils. This practice is at variance with the command of
Christ the Lord: Seek first the kingdom of God.

To pray, therefore, as we ought, we should have in view the greater glory of God, even when we ask
deliverance from calamities, trials and dangers. Thus, when David offered this prayer: Lord, rebuke me not in
thine anger, he subjoined a reason by which he showed that he was most desirous of God's glory, saying: For
there is no one in death that is mindful of thee, and who shall confess to thee in hell. And again, having
implored God to have mercy on him, he added: I will teach the unjust thy ways; and the wicked shall be
converted to thee.




Our Chief Hope Of Deliverance Should Be In God

The faithful should be encouraged to use this salutary manner of praying and to imitate the example of the
Prophet. And at the same time their attention should be called to the marked difference that exists between the
prayers of the infidel and those of the Christian.

The infidel, too, begs of God to cure his diseases and to heal his wounds, to deliver him from approaching or
impending evils; but he places his principal hope of deliverance in the remedies provided by nature, or prepared
by man. He makes no scruple of using medicine no matter by whom prepared, no matter if accompanied by
charms, spells or other diabolical arts, provided he can promise himself some hope of recovery.

Not so the Christian. When visited by sickness, or other adversity, he flies to God as his supreme refuge and
defence. Acknowledging and revering God alone as the author of all his good and his deliverer he ascribes to
Him whatever healing virtue resides in medicines, convinced that they help the sick only in so far as God wills
it. For it is God who has given medicines to man to heal his corporal infirmities; and hence these words of
Ecclesiasticus: The most High hath created medicines out of the earth, and a wise man will not abhor them. He,
therefore, who has pledged his fidelity to Jesus Christ, does not place his principal hope of recovery in such
remedies; he places it in God, the author of these medicines.

Hence the Sacred Scriptures condemn the conduct of those who, confiding in the power of medicine, seek no
assistance from God. Nay more, those who regulate their lives by the laws of God, abstain from the use of all
medicines which are not evidently intended by God to be medicinal; and, were there even a certain hope of
recovery by using any other, they abstain from them as so many charms and diabolical artifices.




We Must Confidently Expect His Help

The faithful, then, are to be exhorted to place their confidence in God. Our most bountiful Father has
commanded us to beg of Him our deliverance from evil, in order that His command should inspire us with the
hope of obtaining the object of our prayers. Of this truth the Sacred Scriptures afford many illustrations, so that
they whom reason does not inspire with confidence may be persuaded to hope by a multitude of examples.
Abraham, Jacob, Lot, Joseph and David are to all unexceptional witnesses of the divine goodness; and the
instances recorded in the New Testament of persons rescued from the greatest dangers, by the efficacy of
devout prayer, are so numerous as to make it unnecessary to mention special cases. Therefore we shall content




                                                         341
ourselves with one text from the Prophet, which is sufficient to confirm even the weakest: The just cried, and
the Lord heard them; and delivered them out of all their troubles.




"From Evil"

We now come to explain the meaning and nature of the Petition. Let the faithful understand that in it we by no
means ask deliverance from every evil.




What We Do Not Pray For

There are some things which are commonly considered evils, and which, notwithstanding, are of advantage to
those who endure them. Such was the sting of the flesh to which the Apostle was subjected in order that, by the
aid of divine grace, power might be perfected in infirmity. When the pious man learns the salutary influence of
such things, far from praying for their removal, he rejoices in them exceedingly. We pray, therefore, against
those evils only, which do not conduce to our spiritual interests; not against such as are profitable to our
salvation.




What We Do Pray For

The full meaning of this Petition, therefore, is, that having been freed from sin and from the danger of
temptation, we may be delivered from internal and external evils; that we may be protected from floods, fire and
lightning; that the fruits of the earth be not destroyed by hail; that we be not visited by famine, sedition or war.
We ask that God may banish disease, pestilence and disaster from us; that He may keep us from slavery,
imprisonment, exile, betrayals, treachery, and from all other evils which fill mankind with terror and misery.
Finally, we pray that God would remove all occasions of sin and iniquity.

We do not, however, pray to be delivered only from those things which all look upon as evils, but also from
those things which almost all consider to be good, such as riches, honours, health, strength and even life itself;
that is, we ask that these things be not detrimental or ruinous to our soul's welfare.

We also beg of God that we be not cut off by a sudden death; that we provoke not His anger against us; that we
be not condemned to suffer the punishments reserved for the wicked; that we be not sentenced to endure the fire
of purgatory, from which we piously and devoutly implore that others may be liberated.

This is the explanation of this Petition given by the Church in the Mass and Litanies, where we pray to be
delivered from evil past, present and to come.




"Deliver Us"

The goodness of God delivers us from evil in a variety of ways. He prevents impending evils, as we read with
regard to the Patriarch Jacob, whom He delivered from the enemies that were stirred up against him on account
of the slaughter of the Sichimites. For we read: The terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they
durst not pursue after them as they went away.




                                                       342
The blessed who reign with Christ the Lord in heaven have been delivered by the divine assistance from all evil;
but, as for us, although the Almighty delivers us from some evils, it is not His will that, while journeying in this,
our mortal pilgrimage, we should be entirely exempt from all. The consolations with which God sometimes
refreshes those who labor under adversity are, however, equivalent to an exemption from all evil; and with these
the Prophet consoled himself when he said: According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy
consolations have rejoiced my soul.

God, moreover, delivers men from evil when he preserves them unhurt in the midst of extreme danger, as He
did in the case of the children thrown into the fiery furnace, whom the fire did not burn; and of Daniel, whom
the lions did not injure.




Deliverance From Satan Especially Asked For

According to the interpretation of St. Basil the Great, St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine, the devil is specially
called the evil one, because he was the author of man's transgression, that is, of his sin and iniquity, and also
because God makes use of him as an instrument to chastise sinful and impious men. For the evils which
mankind endures in punishment of sin are appointed by God; and this is the meaning of these words of Holy
Writ: Shall there be evil in a city which the Lard hath not done? and: I am the Lord and there is none else: I
form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil.

The devil is also called evil, because, although we have never injured him, he wages perpetual war against us,
and pursues us with mortal hatred. If we put on the armour of faith and the shield of innocence, he can have no
power to hurt us; nevertheless he unceasingly tempts us by external evils and every other means of annoyance
within his reach. Wherefore we beseech God to deliver us from the evil one.

We say from evil, not from evils, because the evils which we experience from others we ascribe to the arch
enemy as their author and instigator. Hence instead of cherishing resentment against our neighbour, we should
turn our hatred and anger against Satan himself, by whom men are instigated to harm us.

Therefore if your neighbour has injured you in any respect, when you pray to God your Father, beg of Him not
only to deliver you from evil, that is, from the injuries which your neighbour inflicts; but also to rescue your
neighbour from the power of the devil, whose wicked suggestions impel men to wrong.




Patience and Joy under Continued Affliction

Next we must remember that if by prayers and supplications we are not delivered from evil, we should endure
our afflictions with patience, convinced that it is the will of God that we should so endure them. If, therefore,
God hear not our prayers, we are not to yield to feelings of peevishness or discontent; we must submit in all
things to the divine will and pleasure, regarding as useful and salutary to us that which happens in accordance
with the will of God, not that which is agreeable to our own wishes.

Finally, the pious hearers should be admonished that during our mortal career we should be prepared to meet
every kind of affliction and calamity, not only with patience, but even with joy. For it is written: All that will
live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution; and again: Through many tribulations we must enter into the
kingdom of God; and further: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so enter into his glory? A
servant should not be greater than his master; and as St. Bernard says: Delicate members do not become a head
crowned with thorns. The glorious example of Urias challenges our imitation. When urged by David to remain
at home, he replied: The ark of God, and Israel, and Juda, dwell in tents; and shall I go into my house?




                                                        343
If to prayer we bring with us these reflections and these dispositions, although surrounded by menaces and
encompassed by evils on every side, we shall, like the three children who passed unhurt amidst the flames, be
preserved uninjured; or at least, like the Machabees, we shall bear up against adverse fortune with firmness and
fortitude.

In the midst of contumelies and tortures we should imitate the blessed Apostles, who, after they had been
scourged, rejoiced exceedingly that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for Christ Jesus. Filled with
such sentiments, we shall sing in transports of joy: Princes have persecuted me without cause; and my heart
hath been in awe of thy words; I will rejoice at thy words, as one that hath found great spoil.




THE SEAL OF THE LORD'S PRAYER

"Amen"




Necessity Of Explaining The Conclusion Of The Lord's Prayer

St. Jerome in his commentary on St. Matthew rightly calls this word what it really is, the seal of the Lord's
Prayer. As then we have already admonished the faithful with regard to the preparation to be made before this
holy prayer, so we deem it necessary that they should also know why we close our prayers with this word, and
what it signifies; for devotion in concluding our prayers is not less important than attention in beginning them.




fruits that Come at the Conclusion of Prayer




Assurance That We Have Been Heard

The faithful, then, should be taught that the fruits, which we gather from the conclusion of the Lord's Prayer are
numerous and abundant, the greatest and most joyful of them being the attainment of what we ask. On this point
enough has already been said.




Fervour And Illumination

By this concluding word, not only do we obtain a propitious hearing from God, but also receive other blessings
of a higher order still, the excellence of which surpasses all powers of description.

For since, as St. Cyprian remarks, by prayer man converses with God, it happens in a wonderful manner that the
divine Majesty is brought nearer to those who are engaged in prayer than to others, and enriches them with
singular gifts. Those, therefore, who pray devoutly, may not be inaptly compared to persons who approach a
glowing fire; if cold, they derive warmth; if warm, they derive heat. Thus, also, those who approach God (in
prayer) depart with a warmth proportioned to their faith and fervour; the heart is inflamed with zeal for the
glory of God, the mind is illumined after an admirable manner, and they are enriched exceedingly with divine
gifts, as it is written: Thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness.




                                                       344
An example for all is that great man Moses. By intercourse and converse with God he so shone with the
reflected splendours of the Divinity, that the Israelites could not look upon his eyes or countenance.




Sweetness

Those who pray with such vehement fervour enjoy in a wonderful manner the goodness and majesty of God. In
the morning, says the Prophet, I will stand before thee, and will see; because thou art not a God that willest
iniquity.

The more familiar these truths are to the mind, the more piously do we venerate, and the more fervently do we
worship God, and the more delightfully do we taste how sweet is the Lord, and how truly blessed are all who
hope in Him.




Confidence And Gratitude

Encircled by the most clear light from above we also discover our own lowliness and how exalted is the majesty
of God, according to the saying of St. Augustine: Give me to know Thee: give me to know myself. Distrusting
our own strength, we thus throw ourselves unreservedly upon the goodness of God, not doubting that He, who
cherishes us in the bosom of His paternal wondrous love, will afford us in abundance whatever is necessary for
life and salvation. Thus we shall turn to God with the warmest gratitude our hearts can conceive and our lips
express. This we read that holy David did, who commenced by praying: Save me from all them that persecute
me, and concluded with these words, I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice, and will sing to the
name of the Lord the most High.'




Illustrations From The Psalms

There are innumerable prayers of the Saints of the same kind, whose beginnings are full of fear, but which end
with hope and joy. This spirit, however, is eminently conspicuous in the prayers of David.

When agitated by fear he began his prayer thus: Many are they who rise up against me: many say to my soul,
There is no salvation for him in his God; but at length, armed with fortitude and holy joy, he adds: I will not
fear thousands of the people surrounding me.

In another Psalm, after he had lamented his misery, we see him towards the end, reposing confidence in God
and rejoicing exceedingly in the hope of salvation: In peace in the self-same, I will sleep, and I will rest.

Again, with what fear and trembling must the Prophet not have been agitated when he exclaimed: O Lord,
rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath! Yet, on the other hand, what confidence and joy
must not have been his when he added: Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the
voice of my weeping!

When filled with dread of the wrath and fury of Saul, with what lowliness and humility does he not implore the
divine assistance: Save me, O Lord, by thy name, and Judge me in thy strength! and yet, in the same Psalm he
adds these words of joy and confidence: Behold, God is my help; and the Lord is the helper of my soul.

Let him, therefore, who has recourse to holy prayer approach God his Father, fortified by faith and animated by
hope, not doubting that he will obtain those blessings of which he stands in need.

Meaning of the Word "Amen"




First Explanation

The word amen, with which the Lord's Prayer concludes, contains, as it were, the germs of many of these
thoughts and reflections which we nave just considered. Indeed, so frequent was this Hebrew word in the mouth
of the Saviour, that it pleased the Holy Ghost to have it retained in the Church of God. Its meaning may be said
to be: Know that thy prayers are heard. It has the force of a response, as if God answers the suppliant, and
graciously dismisses him, after having favourably heard his prayers.

This-interpretation has been approved by the constant usage of the Church of God. In the Sacrifice of the Mass,
when the Lord's Prayer is said she does not assign the word amen to the server who answers: But deliver us
front evil. She reserves it as appropriate to the priest himself, who, as mediator between God and man, answers
Amen, thus intimating that God has heard the prayers of His people.

This practice, however, is not common to all the prayers, but is peculiar to the Lord's Prayer. To the other
prayers the server answers Amen, because in every other this word only expresses assent and desire. In the
Lord's Prayer it is an answer, intimating that God has heard the petition of His suppliant.




Other Explanations Of The Word "Amen"

By many, the word amen is differently interpreted. The Septuagint interprets it, So be it; others translate it,
Verily: Aquila renders it, Faithfully. Which of these versions we adopt, is a matter of little importance, provided
we understand the word to have the sense already mentioned, namely, that when the priest (pronounces Amen),
it signifies the concession of what hag been prayed for. This interpretation is supported by St- Paul in his Epistle
to the Corinthians, where he says: All the promises of God are in him, "it is"; therefore also by him, amen to
God, unto our glory.




Advantages of Terminating our Prayer with this Word

To us also this word is very appropriate, containing, as it does, some confirmation of the Petitions which we
have already offered up. It also fixes our attention when we are engaged in holy prayer; for it frequently
happens that in prayer a variety of distracting thoughts divert the mind to other objects.

Nay, more, by this word we most earnestly beg of God that all our preceding Petitions may be granted; or
rather, understanding that they have been all granted, and feeling the divine assistance powerfully present with
us, we cry out together with the Prophet: Behold God is my helper; and the Lord is the protector of my soul.

Nor can anyone doubt that God is moved by the name of His Son, and by a word so often uttered by Him who,
as the Apostle says, was always heard for his reverence.

                       A CATECHISM FOR TODAY
Introduction

A Catechism for Today is presented to the church to be used for the instruction of young
people proceeding to communicant membership. It is also intended for use by adult study
groups, new membership classes and by individuals who may wish to have a “question
and answer” introduction to the main beliefs of the Christian faith. This catechism is
written by and for Presbyterians, yet it contains, as John Calvin said, “articles of faith
common to all Christians.” Like the Heidelberg Catechism, this new catechism has been
divided into 52 sections so that it may be used as an insert in Sunday church bulletins.
What justification is there for rehabilitating a form of instruction that has long since
fallen into disuse? There are several reasons: First, by focusing on the Apostles’ Creed,
the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer, catechisms are useful manuals of
instruction in the Christian ABCs for young people and lay people in general. Secondly,
the catechetical form of instruction is a time-honoured method that goes back to ancient
Israel (Exodus 12:26), was used widely in the early church and became particularly
popular at the time of the Protestant sixteenth-century Reformation to address and
overcome the problem of widespread ignorance of basic Christian teaching. Thirdly,
where the catechetical form of instruction is still followed in churches, such as the
Roman Catholic, the Christian Reformed and some Presbyterian churches, a higher level
of knowledge of Christian teaching is generally the case.

Arguably, many of our congregations have failed to do a creditable job of educating their
children, young people and adults in basic Christianity. Hand in hand with the study of
scripture, a catechism may prove, once again, to be an effective instrument for passing on
“the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints” (Jude 1:3).
Creed, commandments and cult are the three staples of most catechisms and in this
respect A Catechism for Today resembles earlier ones. But it also engages more recent
questions such as faith in a secular age, science and religion, the care of the earth,
concern for the poor, Christianity and world religions, to mention only a few.

Where the framework has permitted, particularly of the Apostles’ Creed, a biblical
narrative approach has been employed. Each answer draws as much as possible on the
Bible. It and the resources of the Christian tradition, including quotations from earlier
catechisms, are incorporated into a number of the answers. We are the grateful heirs of a
long and strong confessional and catechetical history, which can still instruct us in our
own day.
It is not intended that the catechism should be committed to memory although it is
hoped that the Apostles’ Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer will be
memorized. A helpful way of using the catechism is to read the question, use it as a basis
for discussion, then to read the answer and the biblical passages that are given and to ask
whether it is an appropriate and helpful one. The answers are intended as a guide to
thinking about what we believe, what we ought to do and what we may hope rather
than as dogmatic, definitive answers. At the same time, great care was taken to formulate
the answers in faithfulness to the Christian tradition and its contemporary relevance.
In response to numerous requests, biblical passages have been appended to each of the
answers. The biblical texts are to be seen and used not as proof texts but as the primary
biblical witness about which, as Christians, we are asked to reflect and which the
answers seek to interpret and elucidate. Occasionally passages with a slightly different
emphasis are included to expand the discussion beyond the given answers.
In the hands of a knowledgeable and capable teacher, A Catechism for Today, we trust
will prove to be a helpful instrument of Christian education. For those who require a
more elementary catechism, “Belonging to God: A First Catechism of the Presbyterian
Church (USA),” is highly recommended.
                                      Sunday 1
Question 1.     What is God’s purpose for our lives?

We have been made for joy: joy in knowing, loving and serving God, joy in knowing,
loving and serving one another, joy in the wonder of all God’s works.
  Gen 1:27-28       So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he
                    created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them.
  Isa 65:18         For I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.
  Ps 40:8           I delight to do your will, O my God.
  See also:         Isa 58:2; Job 22:26; Lk 1:47; Jn 16:22,24; Rom 7:22; Phil 4:4; Rev 19:7.

Question 2.     What does it mean to know, love and serve God?

We know God in Jesus Christ witnessed to in scripture. We love and serve God in
worship and in the care and compassion we show for all creation. Worship draws us into
the work of Christ. In union with him we pray and work for the healing and salvation of
the world. Christ calls us to a life of kindness and generosity. How can we love God,
whom we cannot see, without loving those whom we can see?
  Jn 1:18           No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the
                    Father’s heart, who has made him known.
  Mt 22:37-39       You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
                    your soul, and with all your mind...You shall love your neighbour as
                    yourself.
  1 Jn 4::20        Those who say, “I love God,” and hate their brothers or sisters, are
                    liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have
                    seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.
  See also:         Deut 6:5; Gen 2:15; Ps 66:4; Am 5:21-24; Jn 4:23; Rev 14:7.

                                      Sunday 2
Question 3.     Yet some people no longer believe there is a God. Why do we
                believe in God?

We believe in God because we are part of a community of faith which through the
preaching of Christ’s gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit creates and nourishes faith.
We believe in God because of revelation. God is revealed in the history of Israel and
supremely in Jesus Christ. Through God alone can God be known.
We believe in God because the universe poses the question: “Where did all of this come
from?” We reply: “It came from God. God made it. God is creator. The world is charged
with the glory of God and the universe points to its maker.”
We believe in God, because we are made in the divine image and our hearts are restless
until they find their rest in God.
  Rom 10:17          So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through
                     the word of Christ.
  2 Cor 4:6          For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has
                     shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
                     God in the face of Jesus Christ.
  Ps 19:1            The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament
                     proclaims his handiwork.
  See also:          Ex 3:2-4; 1 Sam 3:2; Mt 11:27; Rom 1:18-23; Gen 1:1- 28; Ps 8:5-9;
                     Prov 8:22-23.

Question 4.    Is the pursuit of science incompatible with faith in God?

No. We believe that God created a universe with its own order which we can explore by
scientific investigation. Yet scientific investigation and the Christian faith differ in their
goals and approaches. While science proceeds by theorizing about and testing the
universe, the Christian faith is primarily concerned with knowing God who exists above
and beyond the creation. The Christian faith values all efforts to understand the universe
that God has made. We are guided by the conviction that all truth comes from God.
  Gen 1:1-3          In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the
                     earth was formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep,
                     while a wind swept over the face of the waters. Then God said “Let
                     there be light”; and there was light.
  Jn 1:1-4           In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
                     Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came
                     into being through him, and without him not one thing came into
                     being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the
                     light of all people.
  See also:          Gen 1-2; Jn 8:32.

                                       Sunday 3
Question 5.    What as Christians are we to believe?

We are to believe the gospel, a summary of which is contained in the Apostles’ Creed.
While not written by the apostles this brief confession of the church’s essential faith had
its origins in the first century and has instructed and guided Christians through the years
connecting us in a common faith with the earliest Christian communities.
  Mk 1:14            The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent,
                     and believe in the good news.
  Rom 10:9           If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your
                     heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
  2 Cor 4:13         “I believed, and so I spoke” – we also believe, and so we speak.
  See also:          Jn 20:31; 1 Tim 1:19, 3:19; 2 Tim 4:7; 1Pet 3:15: Jude 3.
I.        The Apostles’ Creed
Question 6.        What is this summary of the faith?

                 I believe in God, the Father almighty,
                 creator of heaven and earth.
                 I believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only Son, our Lord,
                 who was conceived by the Holy spirit,
                 born of the Virgin Mary,
                 suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                 was crucified, died, and was buried:
                 he descended to the dead.
                 On the third day he rose again;
                 he ascended into heaven,
                 he is seated at the right hand of the Father,
                 and he will come to judge the living and the dead.
                 I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                 the holy catholic church,
                 the communion of saints,
                 the forgiveness of sins,
                 the resurrection of the body,
                 and the life everlasting.

Question 7.        What are the three parts of the Apostles’ Creed?

The first is about God the Father, including our creation; the second is about God the
Son, including the history of our redemption; and the third is about God, the Holy Spirit,
including the church and the Christian hope.

                                          Sunday 4
Question 8.        Since there is only one God, why do we speak of God the
                   Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit?

We believe in one, true, eternal God, as witnessed to in scripture and in the earliest
Christian confessions. This one God is revealed as eternally Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
creating, rescuing and guiding us. God is eternal Trinity, three in one, one in three, equal
in power and majesty.
     Deut 6:4           Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.
     Mt 28:19           Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
                        name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
     2 Cor 13:13        The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the
                        communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
     See also:          Jn 1:1-18; Rom 1:1-7; 1 Jn 4:13-16, 5:6-12.
Question 9.    Each of the three parts of the creed begins with the words, “I
               believe.” What does it mean to believe?

Belief or faith is a wholehearted trust in God, created in us by the Holy Spirit through
hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ. It involves confessing Jesus Christ as our Lord and
Saviour, repenting of our sin, and resolving by the power of the Holy Spirit to live the
Christian life. Faith is nurtured and renewed by worship, hearing the proclaimed Word,
celebration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, prayer and the reading of
scripture.
  Ps 56:4           In God I trust; I am not afraid, what can flesh do to me?
  Isa 26:4          Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord God you have an
                    everlasting rock.
  1 Cor 12:3        No one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.
  Rom 10:17         So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through
                    the word of Christ.
  See also:         Ps 25:2, 31:14; Prov 3:5; Jer 17:7-8; Jn 6:44; Acts 2:38; 1 Thess 1:2-10.

Question 10. Does faith exclude all doubt?

Faith is often assailed by doubts and anxieties. Like the man who came to Jesus and
sought healing for his son, we also say, “Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.” The strength
of our faith may vary but we are assured by Jesus that if we have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, it will grow and increase through communion with him, on whom faith
depends from start to finish.
  Mt 28:17          When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.
  Mk 9:24           “I believe; help my unbelief!”
  Lk 17:5           The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” The Lord replied,
                    “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this
                    mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey
                    you.’”
  Heb 12:3          Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.

                                      Sunday 5
Question 11. Are faith and reason contradictory?

No. Faith uses reason and always seeks to understand. Not only are we commanded to
love God with all our mind as with all our heart and soul, but we are also counselled to
be ready at any time to give an answer to anyone who wants a reason for the hope that
we have in us.
  Jn 10:38          Even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may
                    know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.
  Mt 22:37          “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
                    your soul, and with all your mind.”
  1 Pet 3:15        Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from
                    you an accounting for the hope that is in you.

God the Father
Question 12. What do we believe when we say, “I believe in God, the Father almighty”?

Believing is more than agreeing that there is a Supreme Being. In believing we trust in
and commit ourselves to the God who is declared in the scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments and revealed in Jesus Christ. The creed affirms that God is the Father and
that God is almighty.
  Jas 2:19          You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe –
                    and shudder.
  Prov 3:5-6        Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own
                    insight. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight
                    your paths.
  Heb 1:3           He [the Son] is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of
                    God’s very being.

Question 13. Why do we call God “the Father”?

First and foremost, the word “Father” identifies God as the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ. In calling God “my Father and your Father”, Jesus invites all humanity to
acknowledge and to share with him the privilege of being God’s child.

  2 Cor 1:3         Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
                    mercies.
  Jn 20:17          “I am ascending to my Father and your Father to my God and your
                    God.”
  Gal 4:6           And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into
                    our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave but a
                    child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.
  See also:         Mt 11:27; Lk 10:22; Jn 1:14-18, 14:18-28; Eph 1:3; Col 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3; 1
                    Jn 2:22-23; 2 Jn 3.

                                      Sunday 6
Question 14. In calling God “Father” do we mean that God is male?

No. God is Spirit and is neither male nor female. Scripture speaks of God as Father but
also represents God as saying, “As a mother comforts her child, I will comfort you”
(Isaiah 66:13). God’s fatherhood is the source and pattern for human fatherhood and
motherhood.
  Jn 4:24           God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and
                    truth.
  Eph 3:14-15       I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in
                    heaven and on earth takes its name.
  Isa 49:15         Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for
                    the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget
                    you.
  See also:         Mt 23:37; Gal 3:28; Eph 4:5, 5:21.

Question 15. What does it mean to confess that God is “almighty”?

We affirm that God is mighty in all things. After speaking of God as great and powerful,
Jeremiah exclaims, “Nothing is too hard for you” (Jeremiah 32:17). The prophet connects
God’s power with God’s steadfast love. God is a God of love and this love is powerful
beyond measure. God’s great love was revealed in Jesus’ death on the cross and God’s
power was shown in raising him from the dead (Romans 4:24).
  Jer 32:17-18      Ah Lord God! It is you who made the heavens and the earth by your
                    great power and outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. You
                    show steadfast love to the thousandth generation.
  Jer 32:27         See, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is anything too hard for me?
  Ps 106:8          Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, so that he might make known
                    his mighty power.
  1 Cor 1:18        For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are
                    perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
  See also:         Jn 3:16; Rom 1:16, 6:9, 8:11; Gal 1:1; Col 2:12.

God, Creator and Ruler
Question 16. What do we affirm when we say that God is “creator of heaven and
             earth”?

We affirm that in the beginning, out of nothing, God created all that is. God spoke and all
things came into being. Men and women were created in God’s image. Everything that
God made was very good.
  Gen 1:1           In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
  Gen 1:3-4         Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.
  Gen 1:27, 31      So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he
                    created them: male and female he created them. God saw everything
                    that he had made, and indeed, it was very good.
  See also:         Jn 1:3; Rom 4:11; Heb 11:3.
                                       Sunday 7
Question 17. What does it mean that all people are created in the image of God?

The image of God expresses our relationship to God, to one another and to the whole of
creation. It is represented in our ability to think, to imagine, to will and to love. These
have been given to us to mirror God’s goodness, holiness and love as they have been
revealed in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.
  Gen 1:28           God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply,
                     and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of
                     the sea, over the birds of the air and over every living thing that
                     moves upon the earth.”
  Col 1:15-16        He (i.e., Christ) is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
                     creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created.
  Rom 8:29           For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to
                     the image of his Son
  See also:          Gen 9:6; Jas 3:9; 2 Cor 4:4; Phil 2:6; Jn 14 and 15.

Question 18. Why did God make us male and female?

God created us male and female for our mutual help, comfort and joy. God also gave us
the gift of marriage for the birth and nurture of children, for the joy of family life and the
well-being of human society. Our creation as sexual beings is God’s loving purpose for all
of us. Married or single, as male and female, we complement, depend on and need each
other.
  Gen 2:18           Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be
                     alone; I will make him a helper as his partner.”
  Gen 2:24           Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his
                     wife and they become one flesh.
  Mt 19:4-6          “Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning
                     ‘made them male and female’, and said, ‘For this reason a man shall
                     leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two
                     shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
                     Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
  See also:          Mk 10:6-9; Eph 5:21-31; 1 Cor 7.

Question 19. What responsibility do people have for the care of the earth?

We are not owners but stewards of God’s good earth. We are to care for it by not
exhausting its resources or polluting its atmosphere, soil or water. We are to protect the
earth, share its resources and conserve it for future generations.

  Gen 2:15           The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till
                     it and keep it.
  Ps 24:1          The earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it, the world, and those who
                   live in it.
  Isa 24:5-6       The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have
                   transgressed laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting
                   covenant. Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabitants
                   suffer for their guilt.
  See also:        Gen 1:26; Ps 89:11; Rom 12:2.

                                     Sunday 8
Question 20. What do we believe about God’s providence?

The story of salvation as told in the Bible reveals a God who continually maintains and
nourishes all creation. From the beginning God has actively upheld and preserved the
existence of the universe, provided for all creatures and cared for humankind.
  Gen 22:8, 14     Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt
                   offering, my son.” ...So Abraham called that place “The Lord will
                   provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be
                   provided.”
  Job 10:12        You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has
                   preserved my spirit.
  Acts 17:24-28    The God who made the world and everything in it...gives to all
                   mortals life and breath and all things...For “In him we live and move
                   and have our being...”
  See also:        Ps 23; Ps 121; Mt 6:25-33, 10:29-31; Col 1:16-17; Heb 1:3.

Question 21. Does God rule the world?

All events in this world are under the care of God. But there is a difference between
what God permits and what God causes. We do not know how divine care and human
freedom intersect but proclaim a God of love who watches over us and works all things
for good.
  Ps 23:1-2        The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in
                   green pastures.
  Ps 121:7-8       The Lord will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life. The Lord
                   will keep your going out and your coming in from this time on and
                   forevermore.
  Rom 8:28         We know that all things work together for good for those who love
                   God.
  See also:        Gen 9:8-17; Ps 96:10; Isa 45:18; Rom 8:28-39; 2 Cor 4:8-18.
Question 22. If God rules why is there evil and suffering?

Evil and suffering are a mystery and fill us with anguish. History reveals the grim march of
human cruelty through the ages including our own. We behave horribly to one another,
nation to nation, race to race, religion to religion, person to person. Disease and disaster also
add to the toll of suffering. In such a world only a God who has entered into our sufferings
can help. As we ponder our Saviour upon the cross, we know that God is with us in our pain.
  Job 7:11           “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish
                     of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.”
  Ps 10:1-2          Why, O Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in
                     times of trouble. In arrogance the wicked persecute the poor.
  Mk 8:31            Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo
                     great suffering.
  Heb 2:18           Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help
                     those who are being tested.
  See also:          Ps 13:1-2, 42:11; Rom 8:22-23; 2 Cor 1:5-11; Phil 3:10; 1 Pet 4:1-2, 5:1;
                     2 Tim 3:10-12; Jas 5:13.

                                         Sunday 9
Question 23. What comfort is it that God rules?

We can be patient when things go against us, thankful in all circumstances, and confident
that nothing can separate us from God’s love.
  Rom 5:3            But we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces
                     endurance, and endurance produces character, and character
                     produces hope.
  1 Thess 5:18       Give thanks in all circumstances.
  Rom 8:38-39        For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,
                     nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor
                     depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us
                     from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
  Jas 5:8            You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of
                     the Lord is near.

Sin and Salvation
Question 24. What is sin?

Sin is turning against God. It is breaking or failing to fulfil the laws of God; the missing of
God’s intention for our lives. Sin is exposed by the perfect life of Christ: our pride by his
humility, our sloth by his obedience, our falsehood by his truth. The power of sin is
present in all of life, including the societies in which we live. As sinners, we participate in
the indifference, injustice and violence of our world.
  Ps 51:4            Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your
                     sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when
                     you pass your judgment.
  Isa 59:2           Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your
                     God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not
                     hear.
  Rom 3:22-23        For there is no distinction, since all have sinned and fall short of the
                     glory of God.
  Jn 3:19            And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and
                     people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were
                     evil.
  See also:          Gen 3:1-7, 4:7, 6:5-8; Rom 1:18-2:11; Deut 11:26-28; Isa 58:1-7; Rom 5-
                     6; Jas 2:10.

Question 25. What is the effect of sin?

The effect of sin is spiritual death, that is, it has marred but not destroyed the image of
God in us. It infects and distorts all our relationships with others and with ourselves.
While we have not lost our distinctive human capacities they are subject to the
corruption of sin. We are enslaved by our sin and are helpless to save ourselves.
  Rom 6:23           For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in
                     Christ Jesus our Lord.
  Jn 8:34            Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits
                     sin is a slave of sin.”
  Col 2:13-14        And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of
                     your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave
                     us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its
                     legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.
  See also:          Rom 3:9-19, 5:15-21, 6:16, 7:14-25; 1 Cor 15:56; Eph 2:1; 1 Jn 1:9-10; Jas
                     1:15.

                                      Sunday 10
Question 26. How did God respond to sin?

God responded to sin in judgment by condemning it and in grace by establishing a
covenant with humanity, promising after the flood never again to destroy all life. Then
God chose the people of Israel to become partners in a covenant promising to Abraham
and Sarah, our forebears in faith, to be Israel’s God. In return, they promised to be God’s
people, to love, worship and serve God alone.
  Gen 6:5-8          The Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the
                     earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was
                     only evil continually...So the Lord said, “I will blot out from the earth
                     the human beings I have created”.
  Gen 17:1-2       The Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty;
                   walk before me and be blameless. And I will make my covenant
                   between me and you.”
  Jer 11:4         Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be
                   my people, and I will be your God.
  See also:        Gen 6-8, 12:1-3, 15:18-21, 17:3-27; Lev 26:12; Jer 30:22.

Question 27. How did God keep the covenant with Israel?

When the people of Israel became slaves in Egypt God heard their cry and freed them.
Through Moses, God led the people through the wilderness, fed and cared for them and
gave them the gift of the law to guide them. At last, God brought Israel to the promised
land and raised up judges, kings and priests to be leaders among them so that they would
live as faithful people.
  Ex 2:23-24       The Israelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out...God heard
                   their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham,
                   Isaac and Jacob.
  Ex 3:8           “Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver
                   them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a
                   good and broad land...”
  Ps 105:40        They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them food from heaven
                   in abundance. He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed
                   through the desert like a river.

Question 28. Did Israel keep its covenant with God?

Israel often broke the covenant with God. No sooner had the people been liberated from
Egypt, than they fashioned a golden calf and worshipped it. In the promised land they
often abandoned the worship of God for other gods and were led astray into sin. They
also failed to act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with their God.
  Ex 32:1-4        The people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make
                   gods for us ...” So all the people took off the gold rings from their
                   ears, and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from them,
                   formed it in a mould, and cast an image of a calf; and they said,
                   “These are your gods, O Israel who brought you up of the land of
                   Egypt!”
  Hos 11:1-2       When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my
                   son. The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept
                   sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.
  See also:        Deut 9:6-14, 32:10-43; Ps 106:19-23; Isa 46:3-13; Hos 13:1-6; Jer 2:1-8,
                   11, 31:31-33; Mic 6:1-8; Acts 7:35-53; 1 Cor 10:1-7.
                                    Sunday 11
Question 29. Did God break the covenant with Israel?

No. Though grieved and angered by the people’s sin, God continued to love Israel and
remained faithful to the covenant. In grace and patience, God gave kings to rule in
justice, priests to offer atoning sacrifices and prophets to proclaim God’s Word. The
people were called to repent and to return to God.
  Isa 65:1-2       I said, “Here I am, here I am,” to a nation that did not call on my
                   name, I held out my hands all day long to a rebellious people, who
                   walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices.
  Hos 11 2-3       The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept
                   sacrificing to the Baals and offering incense to idols. Yet it was I who
                   taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms...I was to them
                   like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and
                   fed them.
  Ezek 16:59-60    Yes, thus says the Lord God: I will deal with you as you have done,
                   you have despised the oath, breaking the covenant; yet I will
                   remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will
                   establish with you an everlasting covenant.
  Hos 14:1         Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have stumbled
                   because of your iniquity.
  See also:        Ezek 14:6, 18:30-32; Isa 44:22; Jer 3:11-14, 21-22.

Question 30. Did the people turn back to God?

No. They continued to break the covenant and the law. The people hardened their hearts
to the message of the prophets, rejected their summons and even acted violently against
them. In a severe judgment, God handed them over to enemies who devastated the city
of Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and took many of the people into exile in a foreign
land.
  Jer 7:25-26      From the day that your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until
                   this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to
                   them, day after day; yet they did not listen to me, or pay attention,
                   but they stiffened their necks.
  2 Chr 36:15-16   But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words,
                   and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord against his
                   people became so great that there was no remedy.
  See also:        Ex 33:3,5; 2 Chron 24:19; Isa 63:10; Jer 9:7-11, 25:4-14, 44:4-6; Ezek
                   20:8-21; Acts 7:51 53.
Question 31. How then did God keep covenant with Israel?

God sent prophets to them announcing a message of comfort and hope, a promise of
return and reconciliation. Jeremiah proclaimed the hope of a new covenant where the
law would be written on people’s hearts. Isaiah spoke of a Servant of the Lord who
would free the captives and suffer for their sins. Ezekiel prophesied that Israel would be
resettled on its own soil; God’s Spirit would dwell in their hearts and they would know
that God is God.
  Isa 40:1-2        Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to
                    Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term that her
                    penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for
                    all her sins.
  Jer 31:31-33      The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new
                    covenant...this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
                    Israel after those days. ...I will put my law within them, and I will
                    write it on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be my
                    people.
  Isa 53:5          But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our
                    iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by
                    his bruises we are healed.
  See also:         Isa 42:1-2, 49:1-6, 52:13-53:12, 65:17-25, 66:12-13; Ezek 36:8-11, 24-27,
                    37:1-14.

                                     Sunday 12
Question 32. How did God keep these promises?

God led the people out of exile and brought them back to their own land. A suffering and
persecuted people, they looked for the coming of God’s anointed one, the Messiah, to
restore and renew their life and hope. His coming would continue the story of salvation,
which began in creation and unfolded throughout Israel’s history. The Promised One
would fulfil the covenant and begin a new chapter in the story of salvation.
  Ezek 37:14        I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you
                    on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken
                    and will act, says the Lord.
  Isa 11:1-4        A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall
                    grow out of his roots. The spirit of the Lord shall rest on him... His
                    delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall judge by what his
                    eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear; but with righteousness he
                    shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the
                    earth;
  Heb 8:6           But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that
                    degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been
                    enacted through better promises.
  See also:         Ezek 34:11-14; Isa 9:2-7; Heb 7:22, 8:7-13, 10:1-18, 12:24.
Question 33. Whom did God send as Messiah?

God sent his only Son, Jesus of Nazareth, to be the Messiah, or Christ (both words mean
‘anointed one’), the fulfilment of God’s promise to Israel. He is the one promised by God,
anointed to save us from sin and death.
  Mt 1:16           And Jacob the Father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus
                    was born, who is called the Messiah.
  Jn 1:41           He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found
                    the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed).
  Jn 3:17           “Indeed, God did not send the son into the world to condemn the
                    world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.”
  See also:         Jn 4:1-42; Acts 10:34-43, 13:15-41, 26:2-23; 1 Tim 1:15-16.

Faith in Jesus Christ
Question 34. What do we affirm when we say Jesus is God’s only Son?

To call Jesus the Son of God is to say that he is truly God, one with the Father and the
Spirit, not created but eternal. To see Jesus is to see God incarnate. To know the Son is to
know the Father.
  Jn 1:1-3, 14      In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
                    Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came
                    into being through him....And the Word became flesh and lived
                    among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only
                    son, full of grace and truth.
  Jn 14:9           “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.”
  Mt 11:27          All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one
                    knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father
                    except the Son and to anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal
                    him.
  Col 1:15, 19      [Christ] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
                    for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created. ...For in
                    him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.
  Jn 10:30          The Father and I are one.
  See also:         Jn 1:18, 3:31-36; Rom 1:1-3; Phil 2:5-11; Heb 1:1-4; Rev 1:8, 22:12-17.

Question 35. What do we affirm in saying Jesus was “conceived by the Holy
             Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary”?

The conception of Jesus was a miraculous event in which the Word was made flesh. God
became a human being without the agency of a human father. The mystery of the
incarnation affirms that Jesus was truly God and truly man. To say, “conceived by the
Holy Spirit”, is to emphasize the divinity of Christ; to say, “born of the Virgin Mary”, is to
emphasize the humanity of Christ.
  Mt 1:18-20         Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his
                     mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived
                     together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her
                     husband Joseph...planned to dismiss her quietly. But...an angel of the
                     Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do
                     not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her
                     is of the Holy Spirit.”
  Lk 1:30-35         The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found
                     favour with God. And now you will conceive in your womb and bear
                     a son, and you will name him Jesus ...” Mary said to the angel, “How
                     can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy
                     Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
                     overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will
                     be called the Son of God.”
  See also:          Jn 1:13; Gal 4:4.

Question 36. What is the significance of confessing that Jesus is truly God?

Jesus, God’s only Son, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is worthy of worship. He is
the revelation of God and the Saviour of the world. God alone can reveal God to us and
save us from sin.

  Jn 1:18            No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the
                     Father’s heart, who has made him known.
  Jn 3:16-17         For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that
                     everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal
                     life. Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the
                     world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.
  Heb 1:5-6          For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son; today I
                     have begotten you?” Or again “I will be his Father and he will be my
                     Son”? And again, when he brings the first born into the world he
                     says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.”
  See also:          Jn 14:8-10; Rom 11:33-35; Phil 2:9-11; Jude 3:24-25; Rev 4:11, 5:12-14,
                     7:11-12, 22:9.

                                      Sunday 14
Question 37. What is the significance of affirming that Jesus is truly human?

Jesus was human in every respect in order that from within our humanity our sin may be
redeemed. Tried and tested as we are, yet without sin, Jesus is able to help all those who
are being tested.
  Heb 2:14-18       Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself
                    likewise shared the same things so that through death he might
                    destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil...For it
                    is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of
                    Abraham. Therefore, he had to become like his brothers and sisters
                    in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high
                    priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the
                    sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he
                    suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.
  Phil 2:5-8        Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who though he
                    was in the form of God did not regard equality with God as
                    something to be exploited, but emptied himself, taking the form of a
                    slave, being born in human likeness and being found in human form,
                    he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death –
                    even death on a cross.
  See also:         Mt 4:2; Lk 4:2; Mk 11:12; Jn 19:28; Heb 4:15.

Question 38. How can Jesus be both truly God and truly human?

Jesus’ divine-human unity is a mystery. He was fully divine and fully human. His
humanity and divinity were neither mixed nor divided but joined in one person. How
this can be, eludes our comprehension. Yet only someone who is truly God and truly
human can be our mediator bridging the distance between God and ourselves.
  1 Tim 2:5-6       For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and
                    humankind, Christ Jesus, himself human who gave himself a ransom
                    for all.
  1 Tim 3:16        Without any doubt, the mystery of our religion is great: He was
                    revealed in flesh, vindicated in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed
                    among Gentiles, believed in throughout the world, taken up in glory.
  See also:         2 Cor 5:17-19; Jn 17:20-24.

Question 39. How did Jesus bridge that distance?

By assuming, fulfilling, and transforming the ancient offices of prophet, priest and king,
Jesus reconciled us to God. As prophet, he speaks most clearly the word of God; as priest,
he offered himself for us; as king, he rules over us.
  Rom 5:10          For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through
                    the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled will
                    we be saved by his life.
  Col 1:21-22       And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil
                    deeds, he has now reconciled in his body through death, so as to
                    present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him.
  See also:         Col 1:20; 2 Cor 5:18-19.
                                      Sunday 15
Question 40. How did Jesus fulfil the office of prophet?

A prophet is one who speaks for God. Jesus is himself God’s Word to a needy and broken
world. He proclaimed and lived God’s love and justice, spoke God’s truth, and
announced God’s coming reign.
  Lk 7:15-16         The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his
                     mother. Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, “A
                     great prophet has risen among us!” and “God has looked favourably
                     on his people!”
  Mk 1:14-15         Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the
                     good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the
                     kingdom of God has come near; repent and believe the good news.”
  Lk 4:24            And he said, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet’s
                     hometown.”
  See also:          Lk 4:16-23, 13:31-35; Jn 7:40-41, 17:6-8; 1 Thess 2:15.

Question 41. How did Jesus fulfil the office of priest?

A priest is one who acts before God on behalf of the people. Jesus became both priest
and sacrifice for us. In his obedient life and death on the cross, Jesus offered himself once
for all, the innocent one for the guilty.
  Heb 4:14           Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the
                     heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
  1 Cor 5:7          For our paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed.
  Phil 2:7-8         And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became
                     obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.
  See also:          Heb 2:17, 5:1-10, 7:1-28, 8:1-13, 9:1-10,23, 10:1-8; Jn 1:29; Gal 1:4; Eph
                     5:2; Rom 3:25.

Question 42. How does scripture describe Jesus’ death for our sins?

Biblical descriptions include atonement by a priest, the sacrifice of a lamb, the ransom of a
slave, punishment in our place, payment of a debt, and victory over the powers of evil. These
express God’s great love for the world, reveal the enormity of our sin, and emphasize the cost
of our Lord’s sacrifice and the sure achievement of his reconciling work.
  Heb 9:11-12        But when Christ came as a high priest...he entered once for all into
                     the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his
                     own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.
  Jn 1:29            The next day [John] saw Jesus coming toward him and declared,
                     “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!”
  Mk 10:45           The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his
                     life as a ransom for many.
  2 Cor 5:21        For our sake [God] made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in
                    him we might become the righteousness of God.
  See also:         atonement: Heb 10:10; Rom 3:25; Gal 3:13; Heb 9-10.
                    sacrifice: 1 Cor 5:7; Eph 5:2; Heb 9-10.
                    punishment in our place: 1 Pet 2:24; Rom 5:18-21.
                    payment: 1 Cor 6:20, 7:23.
                    victory: 1 Cor 15:16-17; Col 2:13-15.

Question 43. How did Jesus fulfil the office of king?

Jesus was a servant king. His royal power was shown in his mastery over sickness, sin
and death, yet revealed in weakness, lowliness, and the apparent defeat of the cross. As
the exalted and resurrected Son of God, he reigns as King over all creation.
  Jn 18:36          Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world.”
  Mt 2:1-2          Wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the
                    child who has been born king of the Jews? For we have...come to pay
                    him homage.”
  Mt 27:37          Over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is
                    Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
  Rev 19:16         On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed, “King of kings
                    and Lord of lords.”
  See also:         Lk 19:38, 23:28; Mk 15:26; Jn 19:19; Rev 17:14.

Question 44. What does Jesus ministry teach us about God?

In his ministry of healing the sick, feeding the hungry, freeing people from bondage to
demons and proclaiming the reign of God, Jesus revealed a loving God who is concerned
with all of life. In sharing meals with outsiders, showing mercy to sinners and even
forgiving those who nailed him to the cross, Jesus revealed a God who embraces all and
whose salvation extends to the ends of the earth.

  Mt 4:23           Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and
                    proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease
                    and every sickness among people.
  Acts 10:38        How [Jesus] went about doing good and healing all who were
                    oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
  Mt 9:11           When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does
                    your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
  Lk 23:34          Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what
                    they are doing.”
  See also:         Mt 8:13; Mk 7:31-37; Lk 5:17, 9:2; Jn 5:15; Mt 15:32-39; Mk 8:1-10; Jn
                    6:1-14; Lk 19:1 10.
Question 45. Why does the Apostles’ Creed emphasize that Jesus “suffered
             under Pontius Pilate?”

First, it locates God’s saving act in history. Secondly, it teaches us that the Judge was
judged in our place, so that through him we might stand acquitted before God. Thirdly, it
reminds us of the complicity of people of authority in the death of Jesus.
  Mt 27:26          So he [Pilate] released Barabbas for them and after flogging Jesus, he
                    handed him over to be crucified.
  Gal 3:13          Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for
                    us – for it is written “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”.
  2 Cor 5:21        For our sake he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, so that in
                    him we might become the righteousness of God.
  Lk 18:32-33       “For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; and he will be mocked
                    and insulted and spat upon. After they have flogged him, they will
                    kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.”
  See also:         Mk 15:15; Lk 23:24-25; Jn 19:16.

                                     Sunday 17
Question 46. What does the creed mean when it says that Jesus was “crucified, died,
             and was buried”?

It emphasizes that Jesus really died. His death was God’s judging and saving act in that
“God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself” (2 Corinthians 5:19). God did not
lay the burden of our guilt on another, but bore it himself.
  Isa 53:5      But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our
                iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by
                his bruises we are healed.
 Rom 4:25       [Jesus] who was handed over to death for our trespasses.
 1 Pet 3:18     For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the
                unrighteous, in order to bring you to God.
 See also:      Mt 27:32-66; Mk 15:25-47; Lk 23:32-56; Jn 19:18-42; Acts 2:36, 4:10; 1

Question 47. What does the creed mean by “he descended to the dead”?
                Cor 1:23, 15:3-4.


To say “he descended to the dead” or “he descended into hell” means that Jesus not only
suffered death for us but also experienced the agony of separation from God, and in his
anguish cried, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34). In our
severest trials we are assured that Jesus Christ has redeemed us “from hellish anxieties
and torments by the unspeakable anguish, pains and terrors which he suffered ...”
(Heidelberg Catechism, Answer 44). Another meaning in the history of the church has
been the belief that Jesus, after he died, descended to the realm of the dead to preach to
those held captive there, leading a host of them to be with God.
  Mt 26:38-39       Then he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain
                    here, and stay awake with me.” And going a little farther, he threw
                    himself on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this
                    cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.”
  1 Pet 3:18-20     For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the
                    unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the
                    flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a
                    proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not
                    obey.
  Eph 4:8           Therefore it is said, “When he ascended on high he made captivity
                    itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people.” (When it says, “He
                    ascended” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the
                    lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same one who
                    ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)
  See also          Mt 26:40-46; Mk 14:32-42; Lk 22:39-46.

Question 48. What do we confess in saying, “on the third day he rose again from the
             dead”?

Jesus was raised by the mighty act of God. The loving Father did not forsake the Son.
Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary” at the tomb (Matthew 28:9), to
the disciples in and near Jerusalem (Luke 24:31, 36) and in Galilee (Matthew 28:17), and
also to over five hundred persons at one time (1 Corinthians 15:6). The resurrection is
God’s victory over death, and the core of our faith; “if Christ be not raised, we are of all
people most to be pitied” (1 Corinthians 15:19).

  Acts 2:24         But God raised him up having freed him from death, because it was
                    impossible for him to be held in its power.
  1 Cor 15:3-4      For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had
                    received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
                    scriptures, and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third
                    day in accordance with the scriptures.
  Jn 20:19-20       When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the
                    doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear
                    of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be
                    with you.” After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
                    Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
  See also:         Mt 28:1-10; Mk 16:1-8; Lk 24:1-12, 13-35; Jn 20 and 21; Acts 1:3-5.

                                      Sunday 18
Question 49. Why is Jesus’ resurrection so important?

It means that death is not final and that we too will have life after death. In a way beyond
our imagining, God will raise us up and care for us eternally.
  1 Cor 6:14        And God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.
  2 Tim 1:10        ...our Saviour Jesus Christ, who abolished death and brought life and
                    imortality to light through the gospel.
  1 Cor 2:9         But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the
                    human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love
                    him”.
  See also:         Jn 14:19; Acts 10:42; Rom 14:8-9; 2 Cor 6:9; 13:4; 1 Pet 1:3.

Question 50. What does it mean to confess, “he ascended into heaven and is
             seated on the right hand of God”?

Jesus’ ascension means his exaltation to glory with God the Father in heaven. To say he
sits at God’s right hand signifies that Jesus “has been given all authority in heaven and on
earth” (Matthew 28:20). In his ascended glory, Jesus fulfils his promise to be with us
always. He prays for us, and with the Father, sends his Spirit to empower the church for
mission and is preparing a place for us. The Lamb who was slain is ascended, glorified and
is worthy of worship.
  Heb 4:14          Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the
                    heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
  Jn 14:16          And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to
                    be with you forever.
  Jn 14:2           In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not
                    so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
                    go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to
                    myself so that where I am there you may be also.
  Rev 5:12          “Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and
                    wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!”
  See also:         Acts 2:2-11; Lk 14:51; Jn 6:62, 20:17; Eph 4:8-10.

Question 51. What does it mean to confess that “he will come to judge the
             living and the dead”?

Confident that our Judge is none other than our Saviour, we confess that Christ will
come again in God’s good time and judge us. We do not know when, nor do we know
how Jesus will come. We must keep alert, watch, and pray, “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!”
(Revelations 22:20)
  Mk 13:32-33       “But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in
                    heaven, nor the Son but only the Father. Beware, keep alert; for you
                    do not know when the time will come.”
  1 Thess 5:2       For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will
                    come like a thief in the night.
  Acts 10:42        ...He is the one ordained by God as the judge of the living and the
                    dead.
  2 Tim 4:1-2       In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living
                    and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I
                    solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the
                    time is favourable or unfavourable, convince, rebuke and encourage,
                    with the utmost patience in teaching.
  See also:         Mt 25:21-46; Jn 5:28-29; Acts 1:11; Heb 9:27, 10:30; 2 Pet 3:7; Rev 1:7.

                                      Sunday 19
Salvation, Predestination, and Saving Faith
Question 52. Why do we say that salvation is by God’s grace alone?

God “chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world” (Ephesians 1:4). We do not
earn or deserve to be saved; this is God’s gracious gift.
  Eph 1:4-6         Just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be
                    holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as
                    his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of
                    his will to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on
                    us in the Beloved.
  Eph 2:8-9         For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your
                    own doing; it is the gift of God – not the result of works so that no
                    one may boast.
  Rom 3:24          They are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption
                    that is in Christ Jesus.
  See also:         Deut 7:6-9, 32:10; Isa 49:14-18; Rom 5:15-21.

Question 53. How do we receive God’s gift of salvation?

God’s gracious gift is received through faith alone. “If we confess with our lips that Jesus
is Lord, and believe in our hearts that God raised him from the dead, we will be saved”
(Romans 10:9).
  Rom 3:28          For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works
                    prescribed by the law.
  Rom 1:16-17       For I am not ashamed of the gospel; it is the power of God for
                    salvation to everyone who has faith to the Jew first and also to the
                    Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for
                    faith, as it is written, “The one who is righteous will live by faith.”
  Eph 2:8           For by grace you have been saved through faith.
  See also:         Rom 1:5, 3:30, 4:13-25, 10:9-13; Acts 16:30,31; Gal 3:8-9; Jas 2:24-26.
Question 54. What is predestination?

Predestination is God’s decision from eternity to move savingly towards us in Jesus
Christ in whom and by whom we are chosen. As such, it is gospel, good news. We are
chosen for a purpose, to be like Christ and to serve God.
  Rom 8:29          For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to
                    the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a
                    large family. And those whom he predestined he also called; and
                    those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified
                    he also glorified.
  Eph 1:4           Just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be
                    holy and blameless before him in love.
  Jn 15:16          You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go
                    and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you
                    whatever you ask in my name.
  See also:         Gen 12:1-2, 25:19-23; Deut 7:6-11; Ps 139; Isa 41:8; Am 3:2; Gal 1:15,15;
                    Eph 1:3-14; Rom 9:10-18, 11:2,28-36; 1 Pet 1:2, 2:9; 2 Pet 1:3-10.

Question 55. Are those who do not believe, then not chosen?

Though we know that there are some who do not believe and who reject God, God’s
love continues to invite them to faith. God wills the salvation of all and excludes no one
from the reach of his love.
  1 Tim 2:3-4       This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who
                    desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
                    truth.
  Jn 3:17-18        “Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the
                    world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.
                    Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not
                    believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in
                    the name of the only Son of God.
  Rom 11:32         For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be
                    merciful to all.
  See also:         Ezek 18:32; Jn 6:37,39, 12:32; Rom 5:18; 1 Cor 15:22; 2 Cor 5:19; Eph
                    1:10; Titus 2:11; Heb 10:31; 2 Pet 3:9; 1 Jn 2:9; Rev 20:14.

                                     Sunday 20
Faith in the Holy Spirit
Question 56. What is the third part of the Apostles’ Creed?

“I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.”
Question 57. What do we believe when we confess our faith in the Holy Spirit?

We believe the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the triune God and is one with the Father and
the Son. The Holy Spirit brooded over the waters of creation (Genesis 1:2), and gave life
to all living things (Psalm 104:30); raised up and inspired leaders and prophets of Israel
(Judges 6:34; Ezekiel 11:5); conceived Jesus Christ in the womb of the Virgin Mary (Luke
1:35); witnesses to Jesus Christ (John 15:26); convicts of sin (John 16:7-11) and enables us
to confess him as Lord (1 Corinthians 12:3b). The Spirit is the counselor who opens our
hearts to Jesus Christ and the comforter who has been promised by him to be with us
always, “leading us into all truth” (John 16:12).
  Num 11:25         Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took
                    some of the spirit that was on him (Moses) and put it on the seventy
                    elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied.
  Lk 4:18-19,21     “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to
                    bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to
                    the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed
                    go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.” ...Then he [Jesus]
                    began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your
                    hearing.”
  Jn 16:6,13        And when he [the Spirit] comes, he will prove the world wrong
                    about sin and righteousness and judgment:...When the Spirit of truth
                    comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on
                    his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you
                    the things that are to come.
  See also:         Gen 41:38; Num 11:29; Jdg 3:10; Job 33:4; Ps 33:6; Isa 11:2, 42:1, 5,
                    61:1-2; Ezek 37:1 14; Joel 2:28; Mt 12:28; Mk 1:8; Jn 1:32-33, 3:5-6,
                    14:16-26; Acts 10:38; Rom 8:4; 2 Cor 3:17, 13:14; Gal 5:22-23; 1 Thess
                    1:5; Heb 2:4; Rev 2:7, 22:7.

Question 58. When was the Holy Spirit given to the church?

The Holy Spirit was bestowed on the church on the day of Pentecost. Luke speaks of a
strong driving wind and tongues like flames of fire to describe the experience of receiving
the Spirit (Acts 2:2-3). The fainthearted disciples were given courage and power to
understand and proclaim the gospel of salvation.
  Acts 2:1-4        When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one
                    place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of
                    a mighty wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
                    Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue
                    rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
                    and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.
  Joel 2:28         Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and
                    your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and
                    your young men shall see visions.
  Acts 1:8          But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you;
                    and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria,
                    and to the ends of the earth.
  See also:         Acts 2:1-42, 4:31, 13:9, 15:28, 19:6, 20:21-23,28; Rom 8:26, 12:11; Eph
                    6:18-20.

                                     Sunday 21
Question 59. What is the significance of Pentecost?

Beginning with Pentecost, God’s Spirit came to dwell with the church in a new and ever-
present way. All Christians share in the Spirit, “being baptized into one body” (1
Corinthians 12:13). By the Holy Spirit, Christ’s Church comes alive, is sustained, and
guided. And the Spirit also works freely in the world bringing goodness and justice.
  1 Cor 12:13   For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body – Jews or
                Greeks, slaves or free – and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
 Eph 4:4        There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one
                hope of your calling.
 1 Thess 1:5    Because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but
                also in power and in the Holy Spirit with full conviction.
 Acts 9:31      Meanwhile the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had
                peace and was built up. Living in the fear of the Lord and in the
                comfort of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
 See also:      Jn 7:39; Acts 4:8, 6:10, 8:29, 10:19, 13:2-4, 15:28; 1 Cor 3:16, 12:1-31;

Question 60. What does the Holy Spirit give to the Church?
                Gal 3:3-5.


A variety of gifts is given to individuals in the Church. These gifts fall into three main
groups: those concerned with preaching and teaching, those concerned with service, and
those concerned with leadership (1 Corinthians 12:28). Each Christian has his or her own
gift and is called to exercise it in the service of Christ.
  1 Cor 12:4-7      Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are
                    varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of
                    activities but it is the same God who activates all of them in
                    everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the
                    common good.
  1 Cor 7:7         But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and
                    another a different kind.
  1 Pet 4:10        Like good stewards of the the manifold grace of God, serve one
                    another with whatever gift each of you has received.
  See also:         1 Cor 12:1-31; Rom 12:4-8; Eph 4:7-16.
Question 61. How should we regard the gift of speaking with tongues and of
             healing?

Scripture regards them as gifts of the Spirit and gives instruction for their exercise. The
Apostle Paul counselled that their public use be orderly. What is important is that these
gifts witness to Jesus Christ, build up the Christian community, and be motivated by and
received with love and understanding.
  1 Cor 12:8-10      To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to
                     another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to
                     another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one
                     Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to
                     another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of
                     tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
  1 Cor 14:39-40     So my friends, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in
                     tongues; but all things should be done decently and in order.
  1 Thess 5:19       Do not quench the Spirit.
  See also:          Mk 9:29, 16:17; Acts 2:4, 10:46, 19:6; 1 Cor 12-14; Jas 5:14-16.

Question 62. How can we tell when the Holy Spirit is present?

The evidence for the presence of the Holy Spirit is seen not only in the spectacular and
the unusual but also in what the Bible calls “the fruit of the Spirit”: love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (Galatians 5:22-
23).
  Acts 19:6          When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon
                     them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
  1 Cor 14:18-19     I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;
                     nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my
                     mind, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a
                     tongue.
  1 Cor 13:1         If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have
                     love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
  See also:          1 Cor 12:31; 1 Cor 13-14.

The Bible
Question 63. Did the Holy Spirit inspire the Bible?

Yes. The Bible itself testifies to the Spirit’s inspiration of its writings. The Holy Spirit also
guided the church in the selection of the canon, and leads us by an inner witness to
accept the scriptures as God’s written word to us. Holy Scriptures are necessary,
sufficient and reliable for our salvation, revealing Jesus Christ, the living Word.
  2 Tim 3:16-17      All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof,
                     for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone
                     who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good
                     work.
  2 Pet 1:20-21      First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is
                     a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came
                     by the human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit
                     spoke from God.
  1 Cor 2:11-13      So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of
                     God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit
                     that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us
                     by God. And we speak of these things in words not taught by human
                     wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those
                     who are spiritual.
  See also:          Ps 12:6; Prov 30:5-6; 2 Sam 22:31; Jn 1:1-18; Acts 4:25; Heb 1:1-2, 3:7-
                     11; Rev 1:1-3.

Question 64. What does it mean to call the Bible the Word of God?

It means that God speaks to us through the Bible and calls us to faith and obedience. At
the same time the Bible is also a human word and its writing was conditioned by the
language, thought, and setting of its time.
  2 Tim 3:14-15      But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly
                     believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from
                     childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to
                     instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
  1 Jn 1:3-4         We declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may
                     have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father
                     and with his Son Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that our
                     joy may be complete.
  Eph 2:19-20        So then you are...members of the household of God, built upon the
                     foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as
                     the cornerstone.
  See also:          Gen 1:3; Ps 147:15-20; Jer 1:4-8, 2:1; Ezek 3:16, 6:1, 7:1; Hos 1:1; Mic
                     1:1; Jn 1:1-18; Acts 2:42.

Question 65. What authority does the Bible have in the church?

The Bible is the primary rule of faith and life. It is the standard of all teaching in the
church by which we test any word that comes to us from tradition, world, or inner
experience. To it no other writings are to be added.
  2 Tim 3:16         All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof,
                     for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone
                     who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good
                     work.
  Jn 10:34-36       Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods?’ If
                    those to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ – and the
                    scripture cannot be annulled – can you say that the one whom the
                    Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because
                    I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?”
  See also:         Ps 82:6; Acts 2:42; Eph 6:17; 1 Pet 1:23.

                                     Sunday 23
Question 66. How do we interpret the Bible?

Both Old and New Testaments were written within and accepted as scripture by
communities of faith. Those who seek to understand the Bible need to stand within the
church and listen to its teaching. The Bible is understood in the light of the revelation of
God’s work in Christ. We interpret scripture properly as we compare passages, seeing the
two Testaments in light of each other, and listening to commentators past and present.
Relying on the Holy Spirit, we seek the application of God’s word for our time.
  Jn 5:39           “You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have
                    eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.”
  Acts 16:14        A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to
                    us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The
                    Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul...She
                    and her household were baptized.
  See also:         Ps 82:6; Jn 10:34-36.

Question 67. Should Christians read the Bible?

Yes. The regular reading and study of scripture, together with the hearing of the word in
public worship, are some of the richest joys of Christian commitment.
  Eph 6:17          Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is
                    the word of God.
  Heb 2:12          Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-
                    edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from
                    marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
  Ps 119:105        Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
  Isa 55:11         So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return
                    to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and
                    succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
  See also:         Ps 19; Jn 6:63, 68; Acts 2:42; Rev 1:3.
                                      Sunday 24
The Church
Question 68. Why does the Apostles’ Creed emphasize belief “in the holy
             catholic church”?

It does so to emphasize that the church is essential to Christian belief and practice. The
church is holy in that it is set apart by God to be a chosen people in the world. The
church is catholic in that it is universal, including all people of all time who affirm the
Christian faith. To belong to a congregation is to belong to the holy catholic church.
  1 Tim 3:15        The household of God, which is the church of the living God, the
                    pillar and bulwark of the truth.
  Eph 4:4-5         There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one
                    hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
                    Father of all.
  1 Pet 1:15-16     As he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct
                    for it is written, “You shall be holy for I am holy.”
  See also:         Eph 1:32; 1 Cor 3:17, 12:12-31; 1 Pet 2:4-10; Ex 19:6; Lev. 11:44; 1 Cor
                    1:2; Rom 1:7; Eph 1:1; Phil 1:1.

Question 69. How does the Bible speak of the church?

The New Testament uses many images, including Bride of Christ, flock, the elect, salt,
light, yeast, branches of a vine, living stones, people of God, body of Christ, and
fellowship of the Holy Spirit. These all emphasize the union of Christ and his church.

  Mt 5:14           You are the light of the world.
  Lk 12:32          “Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to
                    give you the kingdom.”
  Jn 15:5           I am the vine, you are the branches.
  1 Pet 2:9         But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s
                    own people that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called
                    you of darkness into his marvelous light.
  See also:         2 Cor 11:2, 13:13; Mt 5:13, 13:33; Jn 10:1-16; Eph 1:4-6; 1 Pet 2:4; 1 Cor
                    12:13.

Question 70. How is the church related to the “people of God” of the Old
             Testament?

The biblical image of the “people of God” connects the community of the Old Testament
with the community of the New Testament. The church continues and renews the
ancient covenant people through Christ’s fulfilment of a new covenant prophesied by
Jeremiah. All believers are the people of God.
  Jer 31:31, 33     The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new
                    covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah...But this is
                    the covenant that I will make...says the Lord: I will put my law within
                    them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and
                    they shall be my people.
  1 Cor 11:25       This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
  See also:         Heb 8:8-13, 10:16; Lk 22:20; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 9:4, 11:27; 1 Pet 2:4-10.

                                     Sunday 25
Question 71. What does it mean that the church is the “body of Christ”?

It means that Christ indwells his church as its head, and that believers are “in Christ”. We
belong to Christ and to one another. By baptism we are joined to Christ and in the Lord’s
Supper we share in his body and blood. The church is his body even though it clearly has
many flaws and failings.
  Col 1:18          He [i.e., Christ] is the head of the body, the church.
  1 Cor 12:13       For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body – Jews or
                    Greeks, slaves or free – and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
  1 Cor 10:16-17    The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of
                    Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of
                    Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body
                    for we all partake of the one bread.
  See also:         1 Cor 1:2, 12:12-27; Rom 6:3-11; Eph 1:1; Phil 1:1.

Question 72. How is the church “the fellowship of the Holy Spirit”?

As the church is related to God and to Jesus Christ, it is also related to the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit’s work is to create fellowship or community. Christian fellowship means
oneness and solidarity: the strong have responsibility for the weak, the rich for the poor,
the healthy for the ill, and the joyful for those who weep.
  Acts 2:42         They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to
                    the breaking of bread and prayers.
  Rom 8:9           But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of
                    God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ
                    does not belong to him.
  1 Jn 4:13         By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has
                    given us of his Spirit.
  See also:         Eph 2:19-22, 4:4-5; Rom 12:15; 1 Cor 12:12-27; 1 Jn 3:24.
                                      Sunday 26
Ministry
Question 73. What is the ministry of the church?

The Lord continues his ministry in and through the church. All Christians are called to
participate in the ministry of Christ. As his body on earth we all have gifts to use in the
church and in the world to the glory of Christ, our King and Head.
  Mt 16:18          And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,
                    and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
  1 Cor 12:27-28    Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And
                    God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third
                    teachers, then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of
                    assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues.
  1 Cor 7:7         But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and
                    another a different kind.
  See also:         Lk 4:18-19; Rom 12:4-8; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Pet 2:4-5,9.

Question 74. Why then does the church have ministers?

While all believers have the same status before God and the same task to share the
gospel, not all have the same office or function. Christ has given his church ministers of
word and sacraments to equip it for its ministry in the world and to build up his body.
  Eph 4:11-12       The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets,
                    some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for
                    the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.
  2 Cor 4:4         Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this
                    ministry, we do not lose heart.
  2 Cor 5:18-19     All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ,
                    and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God
                    was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses
                    against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us.

Question 75. Why are they called “ministers of Word and Sacrament”?

The word ‘minister’ means ‘servant’. As servants of God, ministers are called in Christ’s
name, to present God’s message, celebrate his sacraments, and care for God’s people. To
this office Christ calls both men and women. The church’s task is to confirm the validity
of this call, to educate and examine candidates for the office and work of the ordained
ministry.
  2 Cor 6:4         But as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way:
                    through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities.
  1 Cor 4:1         Think of us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s
                    mysteries.
  Gal 3:28          There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free,
                    there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ
                    Jesus.
  See also:         Mt 8:18-20; Mk 16:14-20; Acts 16:10; 1 Cor 9:16; 2 Tim 3:14-17.

Question 76. Why does the Presbyterian Church have elders?

The Greek word for elder is “presbyter” from which the Presbyterian Church derives its
name. Elders were chosen in ancient Israel to join with the priests and Levites to govern
the people. Paul appointed and ordained presbyters and instructed Titus to appoint elders
in every city. Elders are elected and ordained to share with the minister in the leadership,
pastoral care and oversight of the congregation. Their rule is exercised not individually
but corporately through church courts: sessions, presbyteries, synods and General
Assembly.
  Num 11:16         So the Lord said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy of the elders of
                    Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers
                    over them”.
  Acts 14:23        And after they appointed elders for them in each church, with prayer
                    and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had come
                    to believe.
  1 Tim 5:17        Let the elders who rule well be worthy of double honour, especially
                    those who labour in preaching and teaching.
  Titus 1:5         ...appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
  See also:         Ex 3:16, 4:29, 12:21; 2 Chr. 19:8-10; Acts 11:30, 15:4, 6,23; 16:4, 20:17;
                    Rom 12:8; 1 Cor 12:27-28; Jas 5:14-15; 1 Pet 5:1-5; 2 Jn 1; Rev 4:4,10.

Question 77. Why does the Presbyterian Church also have a diaconal order?

The early church had deacons as well as presbyters. The word comes from the Greek
“diakonia” which refers to the church’s ministry of service. Today members of the Order
of Diaconal Ministries are designated to various ministries in the life of the church. In
addition, some congregations have a deacons’ court to care for the sick, the suffering and
the needy.
  1 Tim 3:13        For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for
                    themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
  Phil 1:2          To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi with the bishops
                    and deacons.
  Rom 16:1          I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church at
                    Cenchreae.
  See also:         1 Tim 3:8-12; Acts 6:1-6.
Question 78. Who are the needy?

All of us stand in need of God’s grace and healing. But in particular, the needy are those
identified in Jesus’ parable of the Last Judgement (Matthew 25:31ff); the hungry, the
thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and those in prison. In these and others in need,
we encounter our living Lord. The church proclaims the good news of salvation not only
by word but also by action.
  Js 1:27           Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to
                    care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself
                    unstained by the world.
  Ps 41:1           Happy are those who consider the poor; the Lord delivers them in
                    the day of trouble.
  Mt 25:40          “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are
                    members of my family, you did it to me.”
  Lk 4:18           “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to
                    bring good news to the poor.”
  See also:         Ps 10:12, 12:5, 35:10; Prov 30:14, 31:9; Lk 6:20; Gal 2:10; Jas 1:27, 2:6.

                                     Sunday 28
The Sacraments
Question 79. What is a sacrament?

In obedience to our Lord’s command and example, we observe two sacraments, baptism
and holy communion. Sacraments are visible expressions of the gospel and are given as
means of entering and sustaining the Christian life. By baptism we are initiated into the
Christian community and begin our Christian pilgrimage. Through the Lord’s Supper we
receive food for our journey and are strengthened in faith.
In baptism and the Lord’s Supper there is a sacramental union between the sign and the
thing signified. Water signifies forgiveness and new life in Christ; bread and wine, the
body and blood of the Lord. The grace effective in the sacraments comes not from any
power in them but from the work of the Holy Spirit. Rightly received, in faith and
repentance, the sacraments convey that which they symbolize.
  Mt 28:19          Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
                    name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
  1 Cor 11:24-26    “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me...This
                    cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it
                    in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink
                    the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
  See also:         Rom 6:3-5; Col 2:12; 1 Cor 6:11; Jn 3:5; Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Mt
                    26:26-29; Mk 14:22 25; Lk 22:14-20; Jn 6:51-58.
Question 80. What is baptism?

Baptism is a sign and seal of our union with Christ and his body, the church. Through it,
by faith and the work of the Spirit, we are washed and cleansed from sin, share in the
death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and are
commissioned to Christ’s service. Baptism assures us that we belong to God. Our great
comfort in life and in death is that we belong to our faithful Saviour Jesus Christ
(Heidelberg Catechism, Answer 1).
  Matt 3:16         And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the
                    water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the
                    Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
  Rom 6:4-5         Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so
                    that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
                    Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been
                    united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with
                    him in a resurrection like his.
  1 Cor 6:11        But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the
                    name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
  Jn 3:5            “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without
                    being born of water and the Spirit.”
  See also:         Mt 3:13-17; Mk 1:9-11; Lk 3:21-22; 1 Pet 3:20-21; 1 Cor 10:1-2, 12:13;
                    Gal 3:27-29; Col 2:12; Titus 3:5.

                                     Sunday 29
Question 81. Who may be baptized?

Those who believe, repent of their sins and commit themselves to Christ, may be
baptized. Children of believing parents are also members of the covenant of grace and
share in the hope of the gospel. They are to be received into the Christian community by
baptism, nurtured in the faith, and confirmed by their own profession of faith when they
grow older. It is the duty of parents and those who present children for baptism to
confess the faith in which they are to be baptized and to promise to bring them up in that
faith.
  Acts 2:39         For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far
                    away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.
  Acts 16:33        Then he and his entire family were baptized without delay.
  See also:         Acts 16:15; 1 Cor 1:16, 7:14; Gen 17:7.

Question 82. In which name are we baptized?

Jesus said, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). Baptism is by use of water and in
the name of the Holy Trinity.
  Acts 8:16-17      For as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only
                    been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John
                    laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
  Acts 19:5         On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
  See also:         Mt 28:19; Jn 3:5; Acts 2:38, 8:16; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27.

Question 83. What is the Lord’s Supper?

The Lord’s Supper, Holy Communion, or the Eucharist is eating bread and drinking wine
in remembrance of Christ’s body broken and his blood shed for us, in anticipation of his
joyous return. The cup is a sharing in Christ’s blood and the bread a sharing in his body.
The real presence of Christ does not come through some change in the bread and wine
or through Christ being in or under the elements, but rather we are lifted up into the
presence of Christ by faith in the power of the Holy Spirit.
  1 Cor 10:16       The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of
                    Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of
                    Christ?
  Lk 24:35          Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had
                    been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

                                     Sunday 30
Question 84. Who may participate in the Lord’s Supper?

All those who love the Lord Jesus and belong to any Christian church may participate.
We come to the Lord’s table not because any individual goodness gives us a right to
come, but because Christ welcomes us. He loved us, gave himself for us, and invites us to
receive his body and blood to our spiritual nourishment and growth in grace. Baptized
children may participate if they have their parent’s permission, the session’s approval,
and have received instruction in the meaning of the Lord’s Supper.
  Acts 2:42         They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to
                    the breaking of bread and the prayers.
  1 Cor 11:8-29     Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the
                    cup. For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and
                    drink judgment against themselves.
  See also:         Lk 12:39.

Question 85. What do we affirm when we speak of “the communion of saints”?

As believers we have communion with God the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ
through the Holy Spirit. In Jesus Christ we are “saints”; that is, we share in holy things,
such as Holy Communion, and we are united with all the saints past, present and future.
Indeed, we are surrounded by a “great cloud of witnesses” who inspire us to run with
determination the race that is set before us.
  1 Jn 1:3          We declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may
                    have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father
                    and with his Son Jesus Christ.
  Heb 12:1          Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
                    let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely,
                    and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us.
  See also:         2 Cor 12:13; Eph 2:19-22, 4:4; Rom 1:11-12.

                                     Sunday 31
The Church and Religion
Question 86. Is Jesus Christ the only way to salvation?

Yes. Jesus Christ, is the Way, the Truth, and the Life through whom we come to God.
When we witness to others we point not to a religion or an institution but to a person,
Jesus Christ. Decisively and uniquely, God has spoken his word in him and we are
compelled to share this good news.
  Jn 14:6           Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one
                    comes to the Father except through me.”
  Acts 4:11-12      This Jesus is ‘the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has
                    become the cornerstone.’ There is salvation in no one else, for there
                    is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we
                    must be saved.
  Rom 1:16          For I am not ashamed of the gospel; it is the power of God for
                    salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the
                    Greek.

Question 87. Should we proclaim the gospel to people of other religions?

Yes. The good news of God’s love in Jesus Christ is for all people, including those who
practice other religions. Yet we also hold that God’s Spirit is at work in people of all
religions producing truth and inspiring goodness. When we approach them with the
gospel we address them not in a spirit of arrogance but in humility, “like beggars telling
others where food is to be found.”
  Titus 2:11        For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all, training
                    us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age
                    to live lives that are self-controlled, upright and godly.
  1 Tim 2:3         God our Saviour...desires everyone to be saved and to come to the
                    knowledge of the truth.
  Rom 15:7          In a word, accept one another as Christ accepted us to the glory of
                    God (New English Bible).
  See also:         Rom 11:32, 13:10; Ps 103:8; Jn 3:19; Lk 6:37; Mt 5:44.
Question 88. What then is the eternal destiny of those who have not believed
in Christ?

It is not for us to say how God will deal with people of other beliefs or of no belief. Three
things are clear: first, God loves universally; secondly, the God who loves in freedom
grants us the freedom to respond to the offer of salvation; thirdly, the destiny of all
people is in the hands of God, whose love, mercy and justice we trust.
  Ps 103:8          The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in
                    love.
  Rom 9:32          For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be
                    merciful to all.
  Jn 3:16           For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that
                    everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal
                    life.
  See also:         Deut 30:15-20; Ezek 18:32, 33:11; Jn 3:17-20.

                                      Sunday 32
Forgiveness of Sins
Question 89. What is the forgiveness of sins?

Forgiveness is God’s costly act in Jesus Christ to pardon sinners and to restore our broken
relationships both with God and with one another. Faith, repentance and baptism are the
means by which we receive forgiveness. In forgiving others we share the peace of Christ.
  Acts 13:38-39     Let it be known to you therefore...that through this man forgiveness
                    of sins is proclaimed to you; by this Jesus everyone who believes is
                    set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the
                    law of Moses.
  1 Pet 1:19        You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited
                    from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold but
                    with the precious blood of Christ.
  2 Cor 5:19        In Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting
                    their trespasses against them.
  See also:         Mt 18:21-22, 26:28; Mk 1:4, 11:25; Lk 3:3; Acts 2:38, 5:31; Col 1:14;
                    Rom 5:8-10; Eph 2:8; Col 3:13; Heb 9:22, 12:14.

Question 90. Which two other words are sometimes used to express the wonder
             and reality of forgiveness?

The Bible speaks of “justification” and “sanctification”. They describe God’s gracious
work of forgiveness, a work which is one and inseparable and yet has two distinct aspects
to it.
  Rom 3:28          For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works
                    prescribed by the law.
  Rom 5:1           Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God
                    through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access
                    to this grace in which we stand.
  1 Cor 1:30        He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom
                    from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
  1 Cor 6:11        But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the
                    name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.

                                      Sunday 33
Question 91. What is justification?

We often try to justify ourselves before others and before God by our own efforts, virtues, or
success. Justification means that we are put right with God not because of any goodness we
can achieve but by the goodness of Christ. God justifies the ungodly. We receive the grace of
justification by union with Christ through faith.
  Job 9:2           But how can a mortal be just before God?
  Rom 3:23-25       For there is no distinction, since all have sinned and fall short of the
                    glory of God; they are now justified by his grace as a gift through the
                    redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God put forward as a sacrifice
                    of atonement by his blood, effective through faith.
  Eph 2:8           For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your
                    own doing; it is the gift of God.
  See also:         Rom 3:26-28, 4:5, 5:1,9, 8:30,33; Gal 2:16; Titus 3:7; Jas 2:18-26.

Question 92. What is sanctification?

Sanctification is God’s work in us by which we grow in conformity to the image of Jesus
Christ, and bring forth the fruits of the Spirit. The process of sanctification is never
completed in this life.
  Rom 8:29-30       For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to
                    the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a
                    large family. And those whom he predestined he also called and those
                    whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also
                    glorified.
  Gal 5:22          The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity,
                    faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
  Phil 3:12-14      Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal;
                    but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his
                    own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own...I press on
                    toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.
  1 Cor 6:20        For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.
                                     Sunday 34
Question 93. How are God’s forgiveness of our sins and our forgiveness of others
             related?

It is exceedingly difficult to forgive. Yet when we are forgiven by God, and helped by the
Holy Spirit, we are enabled to forgive others. We are to forgive even as we are forgiven.
The Christian community is called to be an oasis of forgiveness in the contemporary
desert of resentment and rage, vengeance and hatred.

  Mt 18:21          Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, if another member of the
                    church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as
                    seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you,
                    seventy-seven times.”
  Mt 6:12           And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
  Lk 6:27-28        “But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those
                    who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse
                    you.”
  Lk 23:34          Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what
                    they are doing.”
  See also:         Ex 34:6-7, 32:32; Num 14:18-19; 1 Kings 8:39; Ps 103:3; Mt 18:23-35;
                    Mk 11:25.

                                     Sunday 35
Resurrection of the Body and Our Christian Hope
Question 94. What do we believe regarding “the resurrection of the body”?

Just as God raised up Jesus from the dead, so too shall we be raised. The resurrection of
the body means that when he returns we shall be transformed to be like him.
  1 Cor 15:20       But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of
                    those who have died.
  Rom 6:5           For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will
                    certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
  1 Cor 15:51       Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be
                    changed, in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
                    For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
                    and we will be changed.
  See also:         Mt 28:1-10; Mk 16:1-8; Lk 24:1-12; Jn 20:1-10; 1 Cor 15:4-58; Jn 11:25;
                    Col 1:18; Rom 6:4,9, 8:11, 10:9; 2 Cor 4:14; Gal 1:1; 1 Thess 1:10.
Question 95. What is the nature of our Christian hope?

Our hope is in God, who by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, has given us a living hope.
We hope for a transformed word in which justice will roll down like waters and
righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. We also hope for a new heaven and a new
earth, when death will be no more, and crying and pain will have passed away.

  Ps 71:5           For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O Lord, from my youth.
  1 Tim 1:1         Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Saviour
                    and of Christ Jesus our hope.
  1 Pet 1:3         Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great
                    mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the
                    resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
  Am 5:24           But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an
                    everflowing stream.
  2 Pet 3:13        But in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a
                    new earth, where righteousness it at home.
  See also:         Ps 39:7, 130:5,7; Jer 14:8, 17:7; Isa 11:6, 65:17; Am 9:11-15; Rev 21:1-4;
                    Acts 2:26, 23:6, 24:15, 26:6,7; Rom 5:5, 8:23-24, 15:1; Heb 11:1.

                                      Sunday 36
Question 96. Does this hope make us indifferent to the sufferings of the
             world?

No. God teaches us to take the world seriously. When we experience the contradiction
between our hope of the heavenly kingdom and the suffering that exists in this world,
we are spurred to action. Our Christian hope encourages us to work and pray for the
coming of God’s kingdom on earth.
  Deut 30:19-20     I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life
                    so that you and your descendants may live, loving the Lord your
                    God, obeying him and holding fast to him; for that means life to you
                    and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the Lord
                    swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
  Rom 5:3-5         But we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces
                    endurance and endurance produces character, and character
                    produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love
                    has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has
                    been given us.
  See also:         Ps 27:13, 33:20-22, 42:5,11; Rom 4:18, 14:19, 8:24-25; Mt 6:10; Lk 11:2.
Question 97. What do we believe concerning “the life everlasting”?

To believe in Christ is to have eternal life here and now, a life that continues and is not
ended by death. Jesus is the resurrection and the life; those who believe in him, even
though they die, will live.
  Rom 6:23          For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in
                    Christ Jesus our Lord.
  1 Jn 2:25         And this is what he has promised us, eternal life.
  Jn 11:25-26       Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who
                    believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who
                    lives and believes in me will never die ...”
  See also:         Dan 12:1-2; Mk 12:18-27; Jn 3:15,16,36, 6:40,47,54, 17:3; Titus 1:2, 3:7;

                                      Sunday 37
                    1 Jn 5:11,13,20.



Question 98. What will heaven be like?

Heaven is pictured in the Bible in different ways: an eternal kingdom, the Father’s house,
a house with many rooms, a marriage feast, an unending day and the joy of God’s
presence. Our deepest delights here on earth are only a dim reflection of the fullness of
life that awaits us.
  Jn 14:2-3         In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not
                    so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
                    go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to
                    myself, so that where I am, there you may be also.
  Mt 8:11           “I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with
                    Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ...”
  1 Cor 2:9         But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human
                    heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him”.
  See also:         2 Kings 2:1-18; Isa 26:19; Dan 7:14 ; Mt 6:20; 2 Cor 5:1; Ph 3:20; Rev
                    4:1,2, 21-22.

Question 99. Is there a hell?

Just as the Bible gives many images of union with God, it gives a number of images of
separation from God. Among these are Hades, Sheol and Gehenna. While heaven
describes life in the presence of God, these describe the life which rejects God and
therefore stands under God’s fearful judgment. Hell is not primarily a place. It is a state of
separation from God. Yet the Bible declares that even in Sheol we cannot escape God
and that Christ proclaimed his redemptive work in the realm of the dead.
  Mk 9:43           If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to
                    enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell, to the
                    unquenchable fire.
     Mt 25:41-42     Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‘You that are accursed,
                     depart from into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels;
                     for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave
                     me nothing to drink.’
     Ps 139:7-8      Where can I go from your spirit? Or where can I flee from your
                     presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in
                     Sheol you are there.
     1 Pet 3:16-20   For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the
                     unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the
                     flesh, but made alive in the spirit in which also he went and made a
                     proclamation to the spirit in prison, who in former times did not
                     obey.
     See also:       Ps 16:10; Mt 10:28, 23:33; Acts 2:27; Rom 10:7; Eph 4:9-10; Rev 1:17-

II        The Ten Commandments
Question 100. What are the Ten Commandments?

The Ten Commandments are God’s law for the direction of our lives. They teach us our
covenant responsibility to God and to our neighbour.
     Deut 6:1-2      Now this is the commandment – the statutes and the ordinances –
                     that the Lord your God charged me to teach you to observe in the
                     land that you are about to cross into and occupy, so that you and your
                     children and your children’s children may fear the Lord all the days of
                     your life and keep his decrees and his commandments that I am
                     commanding you, so that your days may be long.
     Mk 12:29-31     Jesus answered, “The first [commandment] is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the
                     Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God
                     with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind,
                     and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your
                     neighbour as yourself.’”
     See also:       Deut 4:1-2,5-6, 6:1-8; Mk 12:28-34; Mt 5:17-20.

Question 101. How are the Ten Commandments introduced?

They are introduced with the words, “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery” (Exodus 20:2). God freed the people of
Israel from slavery in Egypt and gave them this great charter of freedom. They were to
stand firm in the new liberty purchased for them. The introduction also makes clear that
God’s grace always precedes God’s demand.
  Ex 15:1           Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord: “I will sing
                    to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he has
                    thrown into the sea.”
  Deut 6:21, 24     Then you shall say to your children, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in
                    Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
                    Then the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear
                    the Lord our God, for our lasting good, so as to keep us alive, as is
                    now the case.”
  See also:         Ex 14-16; Deut 6:20-25; Ps 105.

                                     Sunday 39
Question 102. What is the first commandment?”

“You shall have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3; Deuteronomy 5:7).

Question 103. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that we are to give the highest honour and adoration to God alone and not to
anyone or anything else.
  Deut 4:39         So acknowledge today and take to heart that the Lord is God in
                    heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
  Isa 44:6          Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of
                    hosts: I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.
  See also:         Deut 4:32-40; Isa 44:6-8; Lk 4:5-8.

Question 104. What is the second commandment?

“You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in
heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You
shall not bow down to them or worship them” (Exodus 20:4; Deuteronomy 5:8).

Question 105. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that we are not to make idols, either with our hands or our minds, which take
the place of God. Idolatry is putting some created reality first in our lives, worshipping
the created rather than the Creator. Any excessive attachment to things, persons or an
ideology may result in idolatry.
  Ex 32:7-8         The Lord said to Moses, “Go down at once! Your people, whom you
                    brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely; they have
                    been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they
                    have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshipped it
                    and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who
                    brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”
  Deut 4:15-16     Since you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of
                   the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely, so that you do not
                   act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves.
  1 Jn 5:21        Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
  See also:        Deut 4:15-20, 9:8-21; Ex 32; Ps 106:19-20; Mt 6:19-21,24; Act 7:39-43,
                   17:16-34; Rom 1:22 23; 1 Cor 10:6-7.

                                    Sunday 40
Question 106. What is the third commandment?

“You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will
not acquit anyone who misuses his name” (Exodus 20:7; Deuteronomy 5:11).

Question 107. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that we are called to use God’s name with reverence, honour and awe. We
abuse the name of God when we use it needlessly as in an expletive or curse,
thoughtlessly as in a cliché, or selfishly to further our own desires.
  Lev 19:12        You shall not swear falsely by my name, profaning the name of your
                   God: I am the Lord.
  Jer 5:1-2        Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look around and take
                   note! Search its squares and see if you can find one person who acts
                   justly and seeks truth – so that I may pardon Jerusalem. Although
                   they say, “As the Lord lives”, yet they swear falsely.
  See also:        Ex 6:2-7; Jer 5:12-13,30-31; Lk 18:9-14.

Question 108. What is the fourth commandment?

Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days shall you labour and do all your
work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work –
you, your son or your daughter, your male or your female slave, your livestock, or the
alien residents in your towns” (Exodus 20:8-10; Deuteronomy 5:12-15).

Question 109. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that life, as God intends it, consists in a proper rhythm of work, rest from
work and worship. To neglect one of these is to get life out of balance. God
established the “seventh day” that we may cease from our daily work in order to be
refreshed and renewed. We keep it holy by not working, by gathering for worship,
engaging in common prayer, studying scripture and witnessing to our faith by word and
deed.
  Gen 2:3          So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God
                   rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
  Ex 23:12         Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall
                   rest, so that your ox, and your donkey may have relief, and your
                   homeborn slave and the resident alien may be refreshed.
  See also:        Gen 2:1-3; Ex 23:9-13; Ex 31:12-17; Lev 23:3; Mk 3:1-6; Lk 14:1-6.

                                    Sunday 41
Question 110. Why do Christians worship on Sunday rather than on the
              Sabbath?

Jesus was raised from the dead on Sunday. From earliest times Christians gathered on the
first day of the week to worship and celebrate Jesus’ resurrection.
  Mt 28:1          After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary
                   Magdalene and the other Mary went to the tomb.
  Jn 20:1          Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary
                   Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been
                   removed from the tomb.
  Acts 20:7        On the first day of the week when we met to break bread, Paul was
                   holding a discussion with them.
  See also:        Mt 28:1-10; Mk 16:1-8; Lk 24:1-9; Jn 20:1-29; 1 Cor 16:2.

Question 111. How do we summarize the first four commandments?

“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind” (Matthew 22:37) is the way Jesus summarized them in what is called the
first and greatest commandment.
  Deut 6:4-5       Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love
                   the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
                   with all your might.
  Mk 12:29-30      Jesus answered, the first [commandment] is, “Hear, O Israel: the Lord
                   our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all
                   your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all
                   your strength.”
  See also:        Lev 19:18; Mt 22:23-40; Mk 12:28-34; Lk 10:25-28.

                                    Sunday 42
Question 112. What is the fifth commandment?

“Honour your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16).
Question 113. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that we owe proper respect to our parents and that we ought to be considerate
of their needs especially when they are weak and elderly. Parents and children are tied
together by a mutual giving and receiving of love and care in the bond of the family. This
relationship is harmed as much by severe parents as by disobedient or neglectful
children.
  Lev 19:3          You shall each revere your mother and father, and you shall keep my
                    Sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.
  Mk 7:10           For Moses said, “Honour your father and your mother,” and
                    “Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.”
  See also:         Ex 21:15,17; Lev 19:3,32, 20:9; Prov 1:8, 19:26; Mk 7:6-13; Lk 2:51; Eph
                    6:1-4.

Question 114. What is the sixth commandment?

“You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:23; Deuteronomy 5:17).

Question 115. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that we ought to cherish human life as God’s gift. This commandment forbids
murder as well as suicide. It allows for lawful war and self-defense. Jesus emphasized that
this commandment includes hatred, the angry word and the murderous thought. All acts
of violence against the neighbour are prohibited.
  Lev 19:18         You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your
                    people; but you shall love your neighbour as yourself; I am the Lord.
  Mt 5:22           But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, you will
                    be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be
                    liable to the council; and if you say, “You fool,” you will be liable to
                    the hell of fire.
  1 Jn 3:15         All who hate brother or sister are murderers, and you know that
                    murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them.
  See also:         Gen 9:1-7; Lev 19:17-18; Isa 7:7-8; Mic 2:8-9; Mt 5:21-26.

                                     Sunday 43
Question 116. What is the seventh commandment?

“You shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18).

Question 117. What do we learn from this commandment?

We learn that the unique unity of husband and wife in marriage is not to be imperilled or
destroyed by the infidelity of either partner.
  Lev 18:20        You shall not have sexual relations with your kinsman’s wife, and
                   defile yourself with her.
  Mt 5:28          But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has
                   already committed adultery with her in his heart.
  Heb 13:4         Let marriage be held in honour by all, and let the marriage bed be
                   kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.

Question 118. What is the eighth commandment?

“You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15; Deuteronomy 5:19).

Question 119. What do we learn from this commandment?

God forbids that we should take what rightly belongs to someone else. The eighth
commandment includes every form of stealing from petty theft to robbery. It condemns
bribery, fraudulent business dealings, manipulation of the economic system to the
disadvantage of others, particularly the poor, and may be extended to stealing the goods
of the generations to come.
  Lev 19:13        You shall not defraud your neighbour; you shall not steal; and shall
                   not keep for yourself the wages of a labourer until morning.
  Mic 6:9-11       The voice of the Lord cries to the city...‘Hear, O tribe and assembly of
                   the city! Can I forget the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
                   wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed? Can I tolerate wicked
                   scale and a bag of dishonest weights?’
  See also:        Ex 22:1-9; Lev 19:11,13,35-36; I Kings 21:1-19; Job 20:19-20; Lk 16:19-
                   31.

                                    Sunday 44
Question 120. What is the ninth commandment?

“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour” (Exodus 20:16; Deuteronomy
5:20).

Question 121. What do we learn from this commandment?

All forms of tampering with the truth are forbidden. The ninth commandment prohibits
“whatever is prejudicial to truth, or injurious to our own or our neighbour’s good name.”
(Westminster Shorter Catechism). Lying in the form of propaganda, false advertising, the
distortion of the truth and stereotyping of racial and other groups are wrong as they
corrupt our common life.
  Deut 19:18-19     If the witness is a false witness, having testified falsely against
                    another, then you shall do to the false witness just as the false
                    witness had meant to do to the other. So you shall purge the evil
                    from your midst.
  Ps 5:4-6          For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil will not
                    sojourn with you. You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors
                    the bloodthirsty and deceitful.
  Prov 14:5         A faithful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out lies.
  Jas 4:11          Do not speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters.
  See also:         Lev 19:15-16; Deut 19:15-17; Ps 5:9-10; Ps 107-109; Zech 8:16-17; Mt
                    26:57-75.

Question 122. What is the tenth commandment?

“You shall not covet your neighbour’s house; you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife,
or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour”
(Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21).

Question 123. What do we learn from this commandment?

The last commandment forbids any inward attitude or outward action that desires
another person’s belongings, livelihood or status. When we covet what others have we
neglect what we already have. Rather, we are to live before God with gratitude and joy,
disciplining our inward desires and actions, sharing as God’s stewards the good things of
this world.
  Jer 6:13          For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is greedy for
                    unjust gain and from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
  Mic 2:1-2         Alas for those who devise wickedness and evil deeds on their beds!
                    When morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in their power.
                    They covet fields and seize them; houses, and take them away; they
                    oppress householder and house, people and their inheritance.
  Lk 12:15          And he said to them, “Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds
                    of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of
                    possessions.”
  See also:         Deut 7:22-25; Ps 10:2-4; 1 Kings 21:1-19; Lk 12:16-21; Rom 1:29; Eph
                    5:3; Col 3:5.

                                     Sunday 45
Question 124.         How do we summarize the last six commandments?

“You shall love your neighbour as yourself” (Matthew 22:39) is how Jesus summarized
them in what he called the second commandment that is like to the first and greatest
commandment. He noted, “On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets” (Matthew 22:40).
  Lev 19:18         You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your
                    people; but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord.
  Mk 12:29-31       Jesus answered, the first [commandment] is, “Hear, O Israel: the Lord
                    our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all
                    your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all
                    your strength.” The second is this, “You shall love your neighbour as
                    yourself.”
  See also:         Mt 22:23-40; Mk 12:28-34; Lk 10:25-28.

Question 125. What are the uses of the law?

The law, too, comes from the goodness of God and is for our benefit and freedom. It acts
as a mirror to show us our sin, that we may seek our Saviour, Jesus Christ; it keeps our
feet from wrongful or dangerous paths; it leads us to joy in knowing and following God’s
way.
  Ps 19:7           The law of the Lord is perfect reviving the soul; the decrees of the
                    Lord are sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the Lord are
                    right rejoicing the heart.
  Deut 10:12        So now, O Israel, what does the Lord require of you? Only to fear the
                    Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord
                    your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
  Rom 5:20          But law came in, with the result that the trespass multiplied; but
                    where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
  See also:         Deut 7:6-15; Ps 19; Ps 119; Mk 10:18-19; Lk 10:25-28; Rom 3:27-31, 7:7-
                    13; Gal 5:1; Jas 1:25, 2:12.

Question 126. Can we fulfil the demands of the law?

No. We fall far short of what God requires. The good news is that “if we freely admit that
we have sinned, we find God utterly reliable and straightforward – he forgives our sins
and makes us thoroughly clean from all that is evil” (1 John 1:9 ( J.B. Phillips)).
  Ps 14:3           They have all gone astray, they are all alike perverse; there is no one
                    who does good, no not one.
  Rom 7:22-25       For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my
                    members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me
                    captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man
                    that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to
                    God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
  See also:         Rom 3:10-20; Isa 64:6.

III    The Lord’s Prayer
Question 127. What is prayer?

Prayer is conversation with God, the offering up of our desires in the name of Christ, by
the help of the Holy Spirit. It is confession of our sins and thankful acknowledgment of
God’s mercies (Westminster Larger Catechism, Answer 178). Prayer is seeking God’s
blessing and making our requests known to God in the confidence that God hears and
will answer. It is seeking, asking and accepting from God whatever we need. In words or
the absence of words, prayer is openness to the presence of God.
  Phil 4:6         Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and
                   supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to
                   God.
  Rom 8:26         For we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit
                   intercedes with sighs too deep for words.
  Ps 32:5          Then I acknowledged my sin to you and I did not hide my iniquity; I
                   said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” and you forgave
                   the guilt of my sin.
  Lk 11:9-10       “So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will
                   find; knock and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who
                   asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone
                   who knocks the door will be opened.”
  See also:        Ex 15:1-2; Ps 138:1-3, 62:8, 142:1-3, 51; 130:3-4, 65:1-2, 139:4; Isa 59:1;
                   Mt 6:7-8; Lk 11:5 10; Jn 16:23-24; Heb 4:14-16; 1 Jn 5:14-15.

Question 128. Is prayer a substitute for action?

While prayer can become a mere rote exercise and an excuse for doing nothing, true
prayer involves offering our lives in love and service to God and to our neighbour. When
we pray for the poor and needy, the lonely and the sorrowing, the homeless and
dispossessed, we commit ourselves to doing what lies in our power to alleviate their
sufferings.
  Mt 6:7-8         “When you are praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the
                   Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their
                   many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you
                   need before you ask him.”
  Rom 12:1         “I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of
                   God to present your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to
                   God, which is your spiritual worship.”
  Jas 2:14-17       What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but
                    do not have works? Can faith save you? If a brother or sister is naked
                    and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep
                    warm and eat your fill,” and yet you do not supply their bodily needs,
                    what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
  See also:         Am 5:21-24; Mt 25:31-46; Mk 12:28-34; Lk 10:25-37.

                                     Sunday 47
Question 129. What is the relation of prayer to healing?

They are intimately related. The Apostle James asks: “Are any among you suffering?
They should pray. ...Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the
church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up;” (James 5:13-15).
Prayer with and on behalf of the sick is a medium of healing.
  2 Kings 20:4-5    Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the Lord
                    came to him: “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah prince of my people,
                    Thus says the Lord, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard
                    your prayer, I have seen your tears; indeed I will heal you.”
  2 Cor 12:7-9      Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given to me
                    in the flesh...Three times, I appealed to the Lord about this, that it
                    would leave me, but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for
                    power is made perfect in weakness.”
  See also:         1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 5:1-14; Ps 103:3; Mt 8:1-4; Mk 5:1-20; Lk
                    13:10-13; Jn 5:4-9, 9:1 7; Acts 28:8.

Question 130. How does God respond to our prayers?

God always hears our prayers. Yet our prayers are answered, not always as we desire, but
in accordance with God’s loving purpose for our lives and those of others.
  1 Jn 5:14-15      “And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything
                    according to his will, he hears us. And if we know he hears us in
                    whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made
                    of him.”
  Isa 59:1          See, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to
                    hear.
  Eph 6:18          Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that
                    end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints.
                    Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me
                    to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.
  See also:         Ps 50:15, 145:18; Isa 65:24; Lk 11:12-13, 18:1-8,9-14, 22:41-44.
                                    Sunday 48
Question 131. How should we pray?

Jesus gave us a model prayer commonly called the “Lord’s Prayer”:
        Our Father in heaven,
        hallowed be your name.
        Your kingdom come,
        Your will be done, on earth as in heaven.
        Give us today our daily bread.
        Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us
        Save us from the time of trial and deliver us from evil.
        For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever. Amen.

  See also:        Mt 6:9-13; Lk 11:1-4.

Question 132. What is the structure of the Lord’s Prayer?

The Lord’s Prayer opens with an invocation, followed by three petitions relating to God
and then three petitions relating to our human needs. The prayer concludes with a
“doxology” or word of praise.

                                    Sunday 49
Question 133. What is intended by addressing God as “Our Father in heaven”?

The word “our” indicates that our prayer is directed not to a private God but the God of
the whole human family. We call God “Father” because Jesus addressed God as Father
and made us brothers and sisters with himself. The phrase “in heaven” does not mean
that God is “up there” but that God is above and beyond all visible reality.
  Mal 2:10         Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?
  Jn 5:17-18       But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, and I also am
                   working.” For this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill
                   him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath, but was also
                   calling God his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God.
  Rom 8:15-17      For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but
                   you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!”
                   it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are
                   children of God and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint
                   heirs with Christ.
  Acts 17:24       The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of
                   heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands.
  See also:        Isa 63:15-16; Mt 7:11, 12:48-50; Lk 2:49; Jn 14:1-7, 20:17; Rom 11:6;
                   Heb 2:11-12; 1 Jn 3:1.
Question 134. What is meant by the first petition, “Hallowed be your name”?

The first petition sets the goal and purpose of the whole prayer; that the name of God be
hallowed (i.e., held as holy) by ourselves and others.
  Ps 115:1          Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but your name give glory, for the sake of
                    your steadfast love and your faithfulness.
  Ex 20:7           You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God,
                    for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.
  Ps 29:2           Ascribe to the Lord, the glory of his name; worship the Lord in holy
                    splendour.
  See also:         Deut 5:11; Ps 4:1; Jer 9:2-24; Mt 5:16, 33-37; Rom 11:36.

                                      Sunday 50
Question 135. What is meant by the second petition, “Your kingdom come”?

The kingdom of God is where God rules. To pray for God’s kingdom to come is to seek
the rule of God among us through faith, love and justice. It is also to commit ourselves to
work for the coming of the kingdom of “righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
Spirit” (Romans 14:17) which God will bring into being one day.
  Ps 103:19         The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom
                    rules over all.
  Lk 17:20-21       Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
                    was coming, and he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming
                    with things that can be observed; nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’
                    or ‘There it is!’ For in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.”
  Rom 14:17         For the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and
                    peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
  See also:         Ps 85:10-13, 93, 97, 99, 145:10-13; Jer 9:23-24; Mic 6:8; Mt 6:33, 13:33;
                    Mk 4:30-32; Lk 1:20-21; Acts 8:12; Heb 1:8-9, 12:28-29; Rev 11:15,
                    12:10.

Question 136. What is meant by the third petition, “Your will be done on earth
              as in heaven”?

We pray that in all of life God’s will be done on earth as it is in heaven. May this be
accomplished in our lives, in the church and in the power structures of our world!
  Ps 119:33-34      Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, and I will observe it to
                    the end. Give me understanding, that I may keep your law and
                    observe it with my whole heart.
  Lk 22:42          “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet not my will
                    but yours be done.”
  Rom 12:2           Do not be conformed to the world, but be transformed by the
                     renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of
                     God – what is good and acceptable and perfect.
  See also:          Ps 1, 19:7-14; Mt 26:42; Mk 4:35; Jn 4:34, 5:30, 6:7-40; Eph 1:1, 5:15-17;
                     Heb 10:7-10.

                                        Sunday 51
Question 137. What is meant by the fourth petition, “Give us today our daily bread”?

This petition acknowledges our total daily dependence upon God and asks for provision
of the necessities of life for all people, especially for the poor and needy.
  Pr 30:8            Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that I need.
  Isa 58:6-7         Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to
                     undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to
                     break every yoke. Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and
                     bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see them naked
                     to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?
  Jas 2:15-17        If a brother or sister is naked or lacks daily food, and one of you says
                     to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill”, and yet you do
                     not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that? So faith by
                     itself, if it has no works, is dead.
  See also:          Lev 25:35-38; Deut 8:17-18; 1 Chr 29:14; Ps 12:5, 68:5-10; Am 2:6-7,
                     8:4-6; Lk 6:20,24; Rom 15:26; 2 Cor 8-9; 1 Tim 6:6-8.

Question 138. What is meant by the fifth petition, “Forgive us our sins, as we
              forgive those who sin against us?

We pray for God’s pardon and the grace to pardon others. In this petition, God’s forgiveness
and ours are closely connected. It is not that we gain the pardon of God by pardoning others,
but rather that our failure to forgive makes us unreceptive to God’s forgiveness. It is difficult
to forgive those who have harmed us. We pray for God’s grace to do so.
  2 Chr 7:14         If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray,
                     seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from
                     heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
  Ps 51:1-2          Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love;
                     according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash
                     me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
  Mt 6:14-15         For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
                     also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, neither will your
                     father forgive your trespasses.
  Col 3:13           Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against
                     another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you
                     also must forgive.
  See also:         Ps 32:3-5, 51:10, 130:1-4; Mic 7:18-20; Mt 18:21-35; Mk 11:25; Eph
                    4:31-32; 1 Jn 1:8-9, 2:1-2.

Question 139. What is meant by the sixth petition, “Save us from the time of
              trial, and deliver us from evil”?

In praying this petition we confess our weakness and inability to withstand the
onslaughts of “the world, the flesh and the devil”, and we ask that God will protect us in
times of great trial and strengthen us so that we may be able to stand firm. We also ask
that God will deliver us from the power and tyranny of evil.

  Mt 26:41          Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the
                    spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
  Rev 3:10-11       Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep
                    you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world to test
                    the inhabitants of the earth. I am coming soon; hold fast to what you
                    have, so that no one may seize your crown.
  1 Cor 10:1        God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your
                    strength, but with the testing will also provide the way out so that
                    you may be able to endure it.
  See also:         Lk 22:40; Rom 7:14-24; 2 Cor 4:8; 1 Peter 5:6-10; Ps 4:5-6; Jude 24-25.

                                     Sunday 52
Question 140. What is meant by the closing doxology, “for the kingdom, the power
              and the glory are yours now and forever?”

This clause is a later addition; a response of the early church in praise of God to whom
we ascribe the kingdom, power and glory.
  1 Chr 29:11,13    Yours O Lord, are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory,
                    and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on the earth is
                    yours; yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head
                    above all. ...And now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise
                    your glorious name.
  Ps 145:13         They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom, and tell of your
                    power, to make known to all people your mighty deeds, and the
                    glorious splendour of your kingdom. Your kingdom is an everlasting
                    kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations.
  Rev 5:12          “Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and
                    wealth and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing!”
  See also:         Rom 11:36; 1 Pet 5:11; 2 Pet 3:18; Rev 4:11.
Question 141. What is the meaning of the little word “Amen”?

To cite the Heidelberg Catechism, “Amen” means that “this shall truly and certainly be.
My prayer is much more certainly heard by God than I am persuaded in my heart that I
desire such things from him” (Answer 129).
  1 Chr 16:36      “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to
                   everlasting.” Then all the people said “Amen!” and praised the Lord.
  Isa 65:16        Then whoever invokes a blessing in the land shall bless by the God
                   of faithfulness [or of Amen].
  2 Cor 1:20       For in him everyone of God’s promises is a “Yes”. For this reason it is
                   through him that we say the “Amen”, to the glory of God.
  1 Jn 5:14-15     And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything
                   according to his will, he hears us. And if we know he hears us in
                   whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made
                   of him.
  See also:        Deut 27:15-26; Ps 41:13, 72:19, 89:52, 106:48; Rev:14; 22:20.

S tepping   into the   D rama
Catechesis invites us to assume our roles in the unfolding drama of God’s
continuing creation and redemption of the world. Yet we are far more deep-
ly initiated by the powerful catechisms of media, American culture, and
capitalism than by the ancient faith of Christians. Can we recover the sense
that our life with God is an adventure?
C atechism    for   S uspicious P rotestants
What can we learn from the ancient church’s practice of carefully instruct-
ing recent converts or those preparing for baptism? To introduce new
believers to the Church of Jesus Christ is to open for them the treasures of
the apostolic faith and practice—a faith larger than any one denomination’s
claims upon it—sharpened and transmitted through the ages.
F irst T hings F irst
“What is the chief end of man?” The Westminster Catechism famously begins.
This reflection on Psalm 8 exemplifies the rich and lively exploration of our
faith which that first question can spark.
I ntroducing C hildren       to   W orship
We don’t introduce children to worship to make them good but rather that
they will know who they are. Worship that is attentive to the gospel’s grand
story will transform their lives, feed their imaginations not their egos, and
help them (and us) learn to order our lives by the gift of God’s time.
L aying F oundations      of   F aith
First Baptist Church in Richmond, Texas, is turning to an historical method
of catechesis to help adolescents frame their faith expressions and under-
stand the congregation’s historical Baptist identity. The catechism class   
provides the foundation for their growth as faithful disciples.
S piritual D irection
In the ancient discipline of spiritual direction, practical guidance for Chris-
tians of all ages is offered in the most sensitive and delicate way. The best
spiritual directors are both good listeners and active interpreters of God’s
grace in the life of the individual and of the community.
        Catechism




                            Introduction
                      B y   R o b e r t   B .   K r u s c h w i t z




              A catechism transforms new believers from listeners into
              discoverers. Answering its questions, we discover what
              and whose we are. We discover that God calls us into a
              community of disciples, who together join the drama of
              God’s redeeming action.




A
         s we face the moral complexity of the world, no practice better     
         orients our thinking toward God’s truth and prepares us to love as
         God loves than the Church’s ancient practice of catechesis, or form-
al instruction of new believers in faithfulness. Indeed, this “intentional
approach is all the more necessary in a time when cultural Christianity has
given way…[and] Christian identity is not secure,” George Mason notes.
     Catechesis transforms new believers from listeners into discoverers.
This is catechism’s “secret,” its immense value, for the seventeenth-century
poet and priest George Herbert. “At sermons, and prayers, men may sleep
or wander,” he wrote, “but when one is asked a question, he must discover
what he is.” More appropriately, we must discover whose we are. We must   
discover that God calls us into a community of disciples, who together join
the drama of God’s redeeming action.
     Unfortunately, writes Gary Furr in Stepping into the Drama (p. 11), we are
far more deeply initiated today by the powerful catechisms of media, Amer-
ican culture, and capitalism than by this ancient faith of Christians. “The
goal of catechesis,” he explains, “is not merely information, but the forma-
tion of new believers into the people of God. They enter a spiritual friend-
ship that introduces them to a new conceptual world and fosters a new set
of behaviors and attitudes toward life.” Distinctive practices—like repen-
tance, prayer, worship, loving service, mutual correction, and forgiveness—
enable us to enter God’s story, learn our part, and joyfully take up our roles.
Upon these right patterns of discipleship we can shape a time-honored yet
    	                                                         Introduction	




personal expression of our faith. The purpose of catechesis, then, is to help
new Christians embrace faithful practices of worship and service and to
articulate their emerging discipleship in fitting words, art, and music.
     To some Christians catechesis seems like a foreign practice that distanc-
es new believers from and diminishes the Bible’s authority. In Considering
Catechism for Suspicious Protestants (p. 20), Dan Williams examines how the
early Christians carefully instructed recent converts or those preparing for
baptism in the story of Scripture. “To introduce new believers to the Church
of Jesus Christ,” he discovers, “is to open for them the treasures of the apos-
tolic faith and practice—a faith larger than any one denomination’s claims
upon it—sharpened and transmitted through the ages.”
     The artistic tradition of manuscript illumination is a time-honored way
of pointing believers toward the central themes of Scripture. In Illuminating
the Word (p. 38), Heidi Hornik introduces The Saint John’s Bible, the first
handwritten and illuminated Bible commissioned since the invention of   
the printing press in the fifteenth century. An inspiring “gift from the Saint
John’s Abbey to all Christians, to enhance their worship and serve their cat-
echesis for generations to come,” the Bible employs medieval techniques to
convey modern themes and illustrations to “touch the hearts of those who
view [it] with the biblical message of forgiveness.” She examines three
important illuminations that accompany Luke and Acts—Life in Community
(on the cover), Life of Paul, and Birth of Christ—and compares the latter to
Nativity, a stained-glass window from the Chartres Cathedral.
     Burt Burleson’s worship service (p. 52) celebrates our coming to know
what we are and whose we are. “Truth we are professing, / Life we are pur-
suing, / Love we are becoming, / make us all we’re meant to be,” we pray
in Burleson’s new hymn to the Triune God. His friend Kurt Kaiser contrib-
utes a simple melody that may be sung as a round (p. 50).
     George Mason and Kyle Reese take stock of this central function of cate-
chesis in orienting us toward life’s purpose “to glorify God and enjoy him
forever,” as The Westminster Catechism famously teaches. “While Baptists are
not creedal people, the creeds or confessions of faith can serve well in teach-
ing the historic faith to young people and adult converts,” George Mason
admits in Taking Our Aim (p. 58). “The Church must retrieve ancient practic-
es that help to shape the people of God into the kind of people that can, as
their second nature, glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In Living With
Questions of Purpose (p. 62), Kyle Reese explores the question asked of God
in Psalm 8, “what are human beings that you are mindful of them?” We can
discover our human identity only as we live with this haunting question
and realize with the psalmist that “God is willing to risk God’s work and
word by sharing power with human beings, even babes and infants.”
     For practical guidance in instructing new believers, young and old, we
can turn to three articles by Debra Dean Murphy, John Lockhart, and Emilie
Griffin. Through corporate worship with adults, children are preparing for
10       Catechism




their roles in God’s drama, Murphy observes in Introducing Children to Wor-
ship (p. 30). “Worship which is attentive to the gospel’s grand story,” she
trusts, “will transform their lives, will feed their imaginations not their egos,
and will help them (and us) learn to order our lives by the gift of God’s
time.” Lockhart’s congregation is discovering how a question-and-answer
catechism helps adolescents “frame their faith expressions and understand
the congregation’s historical Baptist identity.” As he explains in Laying the
Foundations of Faith (p. 66), “If we put the right questions into the hearts of
children, with answers that guide them toward a faithful dialogue with one
another, their teachers, and God, we nurture disciples whose faith continues
to mature through life.” We often think of catechesis as a group practice,
with one teacher for several pupils. But in The Teaching Power of Spiritual
Direction (p. 73), Griffin shows how “spiritual direction, once confined to
religious communities, is now used broadly by laypeople as well.” This  
one-on-one approach to spiritual instruction can help believers of all ages
“sustain a regular commitment to prayer and to life of the Spirit.”
     “To many Christians catechism seems like a set of abstract questions
and important-sounding answers, a sort of divinely sanctioned Scholastic
Aptitude Test to guarantee entrance into the Kingdom of God,” Todd
Edmondson admits in Learning Life-Giving Ways of Life (p. 81). He reviews
two approaches to restoring the tradition of catechism for youth and adults.
In Soul Shaper: Exploring Spirituality and Contemplative Practices in Youth Min-
istry and The Sacred Way: Spiritual Practices for Everyday Life, Tony Jones sur-
veys ancient practices for Christian growth, ranging from the use of icons
and labyrinths to fasting and spiritual direction. And Dorothy Bass has edit-
ed two books, Way to Live: Christian Practices for Teens (with Don Richter)
and Practicing our Faith: A Way of Life for a Searching People, that commend
traditional practices like hospitality, stewardship, Sabbath-keeping, and  
forgiveness. These winsome books address our fears about catechesis,
Edmondson writes, by opening “space within the patterns of daily life so
that believers might practice the presence of God, not just in the words they
say or doctrines they believe, but in the ways they use their hands and feet.”
     In Catechism in the Worshiping Community (p. 86)—his review of Simon
Chan’s Liturgical Theology: The Church as Worshiping Community, Debra Dean
Murphy’s Teaching That Transforms: Worship as the Heart of Christian Educa-
tion, and Sara Wenger Shenk’s Anabaptist Ways of Knowing: A Conversation
about Tradition-Based Critical Education—Gerald Mast praises this trend
toward restoring practices of Christian instruction. Yet he warns us, with
Shenk, not to overlook the importance of critically examining those practices
and discussing our disagreements. “As the rabbis have taught us, and as
Jesus himself showed, there is nothing more intensely liturgical or worship-
ful than an animated argument about the proper response of the gathered
body to the received Word of God,” Mast concludes. “Of such drama, too,  
is radical conversion made.”

          Catechesis invites us to assume our roles in the unfold-
          ing drama of God’s continuing creation and redemption
          of the world. Yet we are far more deeply initiated by the
          powerful catechisms of media, American culture, and
          capitalism than by the ancient faith of Christians. Can we
          recover the sense that our life with God is an adventure?




T
        he dynamism of art, the novelist Dorothy Sayers once observed, is
        that it is three-dimensional. It is not enough for an artist to have a
        good idea. Her art must become incarnated as a completed work and
experienced by an audience for it to have its full life—whether as a play that
is enjoyed, a book that is read, or a song that is sung and listened to.1
     As a pastor in a church that struggles to transmit the Christian life    
genuinely and faithfully to the people God has called into our fellowship, I
suspect Sayers’s insight offers a clue to what is missing in our congregation-
al life. We intuitively sense the void of Christian catechesis (instruction and
training) among our people, who are far more deeply initiated by the pow-
erful catechisms of media, American culture, and capitalism than by the
ancient faith of Christians. Have we lost the sense that our life with God     
is an adventure? How can we invite our people into discipleship that is  
full-bodied, life-changing, and three-dimensional?
     The entire notion of catechesis invites us to better understand and
assume our roles in the unfolding drama of the Triune God’s continuing
creation and redemption of the world. Let’s consider four questions that   
are critical to this issue.
     First, how can congregations today help children, young people, and
new Christians embody the central texts of Scripture and the Christian     
tradition in order to step into their roles, discern the present activity of     
the Spirit, and cherish the practices of the church?
12       Catechism




    More specifically, how should Baptists (and other free church Chris-
tians) embrace the idea of basic instruction in the faith? There are theologi-
cal resources within our own way of approaching faith that can guide us.
    Third, though catechism calls us into a new community with a distinc-
tive way of interpreting oneself and the world, we can never fully escape
the habits and assumptions, prejudices and politics of our social location.
What challenges do we face in attempting true catechism in our culture?
    Finally, what are some practical ways that we can do this work of cat-
echesis today? As much as we might romantically pine for simpler times
(though we probably underestimate the difficulties that Christians faced    
in those times, too), we live now. What theological and practical resources
can we bring to bear to accomplish what we know must be done?
h el p ing a ne w G eneration enter t h e D ra m a
     Catechesis, if we understand it broadly, is about how we transmit the
faith to the next generation of believers. Richard Osmer identifies three cen-
tral tasks of catechetical instruction: preserving the normative faith, inter-
preting those beliefs and practices amid a constantly changing historical and
cultural landscape, and creating and sustaining the educational institutions,
processes, and curricula needed to complete the first two tasks.2
     Traditional written catechisms followed a question-and-answer
approach to teaching the faith. The strength of this time-honored method is
its clarity in communicating essential beliefs and truths; yet, it runs the risk
of reducing the faith to cognitive development while it neglects character
formation. Learning the Christian faith is not simply about gaining theologi-
cal information; it is also about transforming all of the dimensions of the
person—the will, the affective life, and behaviors.
     Catechetical instruction includes praxis (worshiping, praying, witness-
ing, doing mission, helping the needy, advocating justice, and developing
spiritual disciplines), doxology (prayer and worship), and therapeutics (the
inner work of healing, growing in grace, and sanctification) as well as theo-
logy. Learning the faith, then, is less like a child memorizing the list of state
capitals and more like an apprentice learning a trade or a music student
learning to sing. Foundational theories and essential skills lead us to a  
higher level of functioning that is grounded in new knowledge, personal
experiences, honed abilities, and crafted skills.
     When catechesis operates as it is intended, at the heart of the process is
an essential human relationship between a teacher and a learner. This spiri-
tual relationship is the irreducible core. The instructional contents conveyed
are only the building blocks of this relationship, just as the spoken sentences
of care and love connect human beings in friendships and communities.
     The goal of catechesis, then, is not merely information, but formation.3  
It is the “socialization” of new believers into the people of God. They enter  
a spiritual friendship that introduces them a new conceptual world and fos-
                                                     Stepping into the Drama   13




ters a new set of behaviors and attitudes toward life.
     It is no wonder, then, that teaching the faith is embedded in every single
aspect of what the Church does. Indeed, the “art” of local congregational
life is helping others to enter this drama successfully. Each congregation is
an instrument of catechism, through both formal and informal instruction
and mentoring. People learn the faith as they worship, pray, give offerings,
hear sermons, and study the Bible together. Adults and youth learn it in
conversations as they ride to a mission project together. Parents and chil-
dren learn it as they talk about what is going to happen on pledge-the-
church-budget day or at the annual church reunion.
     A formal catechism class is only the beginning of instruction in the faith.
We should operate, in a time like ours, with the assumption that those who
gather in our churches do not know the essentials of Christian belief and
practice. Ours is a time to be the teaching church.
     Think of the catechism class as an actor’s workshop; just as a workshop
is not the whole of the actor’s training, the catechism class is not all that
trains a disciple to enter the divine drama. This means that we must come  
to every aspect of our life in a congregation with a certain seriousness and
artistic spirit. It may be as simple as adding a few explanatory sentences     
in worship to invite the “stranger” to participate with understanding. (In
truth, we will be helping the member of many years understand as well.)
     Our lack of seriousness concerning two central features of the Christian
life—baptism and the Lord’s Supper, or the “ordinances” as Baptists call
them—deserves more atten-
tion. We have diminished
their role through all sorts       The goal of catechesis is not merely infor-
of “artistic” decisions about
them. In our theological           mation, but the formation of new believers
reaction to Catholic and
Anglican mystery, we have          into the people of God. They enter a spiritual

malists” who can say such          friendship that introduces them to a new
terrible things as “It’s only a
symbol” about the rite of          conceptual world and fosters a new set of
Christian initiation.
     Too often we have             behaviors and attitudes toward life.
replaced these public and
communal acts with person-
al experience (as in revivalism) as the beginning of the Christian drama. Or,
for pragmatic reasons of entertaining television or radio audiences, we have
displaced their observance from the heart of public worship. The first and
simplest thing we might do to treat them with seriousness is to return them
to the center of our theological understanding and a focal point of our wor-
ship. In my church, they are included in Sunday morning worship, not in
14       Catechism




some other “time-saving” location in the weekly calendar. The congregation
stands when a candidate enters the baptistry, to honor the moment. Mem-
bers sense that in this solemn moment something important is happening.
    To these I would add “ordination” to a calling, or vocation, as some-
thing we need to approach with greater seriousness. To be true to our theo-
logy, we must preach and practice calling as broadly as possible; it is not
only the province of the clergy. We need rituals for commissioning mission
groups, calling forth Sunday school teachers, selecting deacons, and ordain-
ing ministers. Who we ordain, bless, affirm, call out, and recognize, as well
as how we do it, is a great opportunity to teach about the Christian life.
e x p loring Ba p ti s t c ontri b u tion s to t h e s c ri p t
     Before moving into the resources Christians have both to invite others  
to step into the drama and to confront the challenges of today’s culture, let’s
explore how the historical Baptist tradition has contributed to the script. We
Baptists (and other free church Christians) already have a catechism—a pro-
cess of transmitting the faith—embedded in our ongoing practices, beliefs,
and congregational structures. We emphasize that the local, gathered con-
gregation is the teaching church as well as the worshiping church and min-
istering church. Religious education is not simply something we “do” at
certain times; rather, it is implied by all that our congregations do. The con-
stant danger, unfortunately, is that we will take this entire process for grant-
ed and not be reflective and intentional about what we are teaching through
our worship and ministry.4
     The most intentional aspect of our Baptist catechism is found in the self-
conscious “distinctives” we preach and teach. In every generation leading
thinkers have articulated key themes of freedom, congregation, Scripture,
experience, conversion, baptism, autonomy, and voluntary cooperation.
     In a famous essay entitled “Why I am a Baptist,” theologian Walter
Rauschenbusch (1861-1918) distilled these to three major emphases.
Rauschenbusch’s first reason for being a Baptist was that Baptists set     
“spiritual experience boldly to the front as the one great thing in religion.”
Practically, this meant that Baptists emphasized the Bible and personal
experience on one hand and de-emphasized creeds on the other.
     Baptists are most definitely “people of the Book.” If we disagree about
many particulars regarding interpretation and application of Scripture,
there is no question that our reflections begin in Scripture and our applica-
tions cannot be disconnected from Scripture. Those who come into Baptist
life often notice how we memorize the Bible, study it, pray with its words
and concepts, listen to sermons based on it, and think about it.
     This importance of personal experience also implies that learning the
Bible is not sufficient. Free churches emphasize the centrality of a regenerate
membership, which in simpler terms means that we call for personal com-
mitment to Christ from all who are members of the church. Unapologetical-
                                                    Stepping into the Drama   15




ly we ask for a personal decision for Christ, carefully assess it in one
another, and nurture it in all the life of the church.
     Rauschenbusch’s second reason was the Baptist understanding of     
worship, which he believed is bound up in the idea of freedom. This is
embodied most clearly in our understanding of a very crucial doctrine, the
priesthood of all believers. A free church, worshiping with a free conscience,
leads to the truest and most spiritual worship. My friend Glenn Hinson has
described this in my presence many times as the voluntary principle of   
religion—”for faith to be genuine,” he once said at my church, “it must be
free.” We might also say the converse—for faith to be truly free, it must be
genuine. Freedom is always in peril in religion, but so is faith’s survival.
     The Baptist idea of freedom is meaningless without its companion vir-
tue, responsibility. The priesthood of all believers, in fact, implies this. Not
only does this doctrine point to God’s freedom to relate to human beings
without the mediation of institution or cult, it also reminds us that the work
of the people of God is the responsibility of all the people, not just a few.
     A third reason to be a Baptist, said Rauschenbusch, is found in the Bap-
tist understanding of church. He believed that the voluntary, democratic,
non-hierarchical, egalitarian spirit of Baptist congregations equipped them
better to carry on the Kingdom work in a modern world. This is because the
center of those churches is not institutional structure but heart religion that
brings a continual experience of reform and vitality.
     As we live out these “distinctives,” we demonstrate to new Christians
how to be in community with one another in the spirit of the New Testa-
ment and without rigid
authority structures. As we
discern God’s leadership, do
congregational “business,”
                                   In every time and place, Christians have
and work through our dif-
ferences and conflicts, we
                                   faced specific cultural challenges to becom-
bring a new generation into        ing the people of God. Today, consumerism,
our way of church. This is
part of the dramatic role          individualism, and the impact of technology
they must learn as disciples
in the Kingdom.                    present huge obstacles to catechism.
re s i s ting
c o N s u m eri s m
    In every time and place, Christians have faced specific cultural challeng-
es to becoming the people of God. Today in North America, consumerism,
individualism, and the impact of technology present huge obstacles to  
deepening our relationships to one other, to God, and to ourselves (rightly
understood) within to the Kingdom of God. Let us examine how our Baptist
practices might be resources for responding to these challenges.
16       Catechism




    Consumerism is powerfully reducing all of the issues of life in our cul-
ture to the economic dimension. We even are tempted to measure member-
ship in a congregation and Christian friendship in terms of their financial
usefulness to us. Will these people encourage me, help me find a career, and
support my family? With whom can I “network” at church? Though the dif-
ficulties of this consumerist attitude are endlessly discussed, the practical
responses are not always obvious.
    One response, I suggest, is in the Baptist emphasis on stewardship, on
the careful management and generous sharing of our financial resources.
The biblical mandates for generosity and stewardship are not just about
“personal morality,” nor about “giving to the church offering,” but about
the proper structuring of all our relationships. For instance, the abuse of
money is a major issue in many marital failures. In the days to come, stew-
ardship will be more important than ever. We will drown in a sea of materi-
al complacency and our relationships will dissolve into mere partnerships,
unless we learn and live the virtue of generosity.
F a c ing indi v id u ali s m
     The pervasive individualism of our culture, with the attendant lack of
genuine community, is a second challenge to true catechism. Family life,
community life, parenting, work, personal vocation, and the Church are
fraying from the impact of inappropriate individualism.
     It often teams up with consumerism to distort our lives. Our sexual
lives, for example, are deeply damaged by both—with consumerism turning
human sexuality into a marketed commodity and individualism exalting the
hedonistic self above all else. The Christian counter-story calls us into God’s
Kingdom where we surrender our egocentric self in trust to God and we
learn to act against our economic self-interest willingly.
     Baptists often struggle to articulate this facet of Kingdom life because
our history and theological distinctives have been so deeply couched in the
language of modern democratic self-determination. Our unique contribu-
tion to the modern Church has been our advocacy of religious liberty for all.
Historic Baptist calls for freedom were born in succeeding contexts of resis-
tance to oppression and persecution. So today we rightly resist any form of
communitarianism that becomes an authoritarian system of domination.
     Yet what can prevent our religious freedom from turning into laissez-
faire religion? How can we be free to believe without just believing what-
ever we want? An appropriate emphasis on “individuality” rather than
“individualism” will help us. Community without robust individuality
turns into either authoritarianism or collective inertia.
     We can connect our lives with the stories of great Christians and the  
story of the Church. Patterning our lives after the lives of believers has    
biblical precedent. Not only will we serve someone, we will also pattern
ourselves after someone. The object is not to produce docile personalities,
                                                     Stepping into the Drama   17




but vibrant and energetic ones. This is precisely what happens to church
members in the book of Acts. They do not turn into zombies at all. They
fight, struggle, advocate, and suffer, but never lose the sense that they are   
a “we” in all of this.
    We can emphasize our solidarity with one another through the free-
church practice of testimony. For instance, during worship I have inter-
viewed church members about how their faith in Jesus Christ connects   
with their daily lives. These interviews have been quite profound as     
members come to know one another.
u s ing te c h nolog y R E s p on s i b l y
     A third challenge to catechism today is the overwhelming impact of
technology in our society. Though family members and friends are more
“stretched out” today—separated by miles, life pace, time, and commit-
ments—their yearning to stay connected has not changed at all. In response
to this deep desire, many important new technologies are connective and
informational in their nature. So we have e-mail addresses and blogs,
MySpace and Facebook, cell phones and instant messaging. Today we can
communicate across continents much more easily than our ancestors could
speak to people living in the same county two-hundred years ago.
     Congregations are challenged by the many competing claims for atten-
tion that these technologies present. Fifty years ago a church might expect
five to eight hours a week of a person’s time, but today two hours a week   
is an enormous commitment of face-to-face contact. How can we utilize   
and develop these “technologies of connection” to catechize believers? The
Internet puts enormous resources of connection and instruction at our fin-
gertips, but how do we use them without unwittingly surrendering some
important dimensions of the faith?
     These technologies of connection can help us to do the work of “instruc-
tion in the faith” in a different way. They should not replace our face-to-face
connection, but we can supplement and sustain the relational core of our
relationships by the strategic use of these technologies. For instance, I regu-
larly maintain contact with younger members of the church through e-mail,
and I am giving thought to how sophisticated, interactive “discipleship”
resources could be placed on the Web. Most church leaders are very familiar
with the frustration of trying to carry out membership orientation and in-
struction in the faith in a traditional, long-term classroom setting with a  
typical weekly schedule, though it is still the best way.
     Might “distance” discipleship training sessions on the Internet replace
the old hour on Sunday evening? What about creating a “curriculum for
new Christians” on the church Web site for those who struggle to be present
through the week? Adults on the go these days spend a lot of lonely time in
hotels and motels and in “crowded isolation” on airplanes where a chance
to listen to something of significance would be appreciated. Laptop comput-
18       Catechism




ers, DVD players, CD players, and iPods offer vastly expanded opportuni-
ties to teach believers.5
     Even while we explore increased use of these technologies of connec-
tion, we must also work in the opposite direction to maximize opportunities
for face-to-face relationship in the context of faith. Believers need intensive
and unprogrammed occasions to talk to and learn from one another. A spiri-
                                                   tual retreat can offer quiet,
                                                   unhurried times for reflec-
                                                   tion and renewal, where we
While we use laptops, DVD players, and             can work our way through
iPods to teach believers, we must also work our         deepest dilemmas in the
                                                   presence of God.
to maximize opportunities for face-to-face             Instruction in the faith
                                                   should also provide oppor-
relationships. Believers need intensive and        tunities to explore our sin
                                                   and seek reconciliation. (I
unprogrammed occasions to talk to and              choose the word “explore”
                                                   rather than “confess” even
learn from one another.                            though I mean the same
                                                   thing.) Is not the exploration
                                                   and understanding of our
brokenness, repentance, and sharing the journey of forgiveness part of our
vocation? In worship, discipleship, and instruction, we need to be about the
work of reconciliation, not of improved perception. “Looking well” is some-
times more important in the middle-class American congregation than
“being well.” We desperately need, through spiritual direction, confession,
sermon, and worship, a fellowship where we can “be ourselves” in order   
to be better selves.
Con c l u s ion
    If the Christian life is like an unfolding drama that we are invited to
enter, then growing in discipleship is less like reading a play than it is   
practicing our part with a master actor. We are not learning merely to  
recite, but to live and act. This is a beautiful analogy for catechesis.
    Too often we approach our life as a series of problems to be solved,  
Dorothy Sayers noted, though the harder we try to “fix” things the more
problems we seem to have. The artist can help us here, “since the artist  
does not see life as a problem to be solved, but as a medium for creation.”6
    Like a budding actor in a play, our life becomes our medium for cre-
ation. Life has certain possibilities within it, and our goal is not to make it
do everything, but to bring out what it contains as its potential. There is
always something we can “make” of our life, whatever problems we
encounter or limits that we have; there is always the possibility that,
through imagination and hope, something wonderful can be made of it.  
                                                              Stepping into the Drama      19




Our work is not to master, to control, or to fix our life, but to explore life as
a wonder and a possibility and “to cooperate with it in love.”7
    The same is true of the Christian life. Catechism is far more important
and far more demanding of our best efforts than we imagine. We have only
begun when the baptismal class is finished. What faces us is the nurturing
of a spark into a life aflame—one that has learned by lived experience how
to love, serve, suffer, and sacrifice so that we might live in God’s Kingdom
that has come to pass.

  4 In Fashion Me a People: Curriculum in the Church (Louisville, KY: Westminster John
Knox Press, 1989), religious educator Maria Harris emphasizes that the church does not
have a curriculum, it is a curriculum. Each congregation forms new members through
koinonia (common life), leitourgia (worship), didache (teaching), kerygma (proclamation),  
and diakonia (ministry). They are not always aware of doing this. Thus, Harris helpfully
distinguishes the explicit, implicit, and null curriculums in every congregation—i.e., the
things they try to teach, things they convey invisibly that sometimes contradict what they
explicitly espouse, and things they are unaware of and therefore miss out on teaching.

             To introduce new believers to the Church of Jesus Christ
             is to open for them the rich treasures of the apostolic
             faith and practice—a faith much larger than any single
             denomination’s claims upon it—sharpened and transmit-
             ted through the ages.




O
         ne of the stranger ancient citations of the Nicene Creed appears on  
         a small piece of papyrus placed in a magical amulet from the later
         fifth century.1 Evidently the wearer thought that the creed possessed
power such that merely wearing it could invite God’s blessing or ward off
misfortune! We have no way knowing whether the wearer actually under-
stood the creed and therefore thought its meaning was powerful, or if the
creed was merely a token or emblem of the Church’s power, rather like
hanging a “Christian” rabbit’s foot around your neck.
    Similarly, reading a Bible passage or reciting one of the Church’s major
creeds today does not guarantee that a Christian will be grounded in the
truths about God—in God’s incarnation through Christ and plan of redemp-
tion. The print on the page of the Bible or the sounds of the creed in worship
only approximately inform a believer in the task of understanding what the
Bible teaches or what the creed is supposed to mean. While Protestants have
been quick to point out the importance of the Bible’s inner perspicacity—
that many parts can be read and basically understood by anyone who shares
in the life of the Spirit2—it is still true that arriving at a Christian interpreta-
tion of the central truths of the Old and New Testaments must be taught.
    Likewise, a creed, which in very few words offers the chief principles   
of the Christian faith, does not interpret itself. As church history has shown
countless times, there have been many who have read the Bible (or a creed)
    	                          Considering Catechism for Suspicious Protestants   21




from which they derived bizarre or heretical conclusions. This happened in
antiquity; it still happens today.
     While faith is something we experience through a gift from God, faith is
no less about the content of what Christians believe. Both kinds of faith are
learned, but the second kind is based on “loving the Lord your God with   
all your mind.” That is, “the faith” has a particular substance that must be
taught to believers. The Apostle Paul talks about this faith in the form of the
Church’s tradition as something “handed over” to those who would rightly
understand the gospel. For understanding the historic Church’s teaching is
“not a matter of one’s own private interpretation” (2 Peter 1:20), but of
“receiving” that teaching and preserving it.
A rti c u lating t h e C h ri s tian Mind
    The earliest developments in Christian education emerged out of sit-
uations of need. On one hand, the early Fathers speak most directly of the
Church’s tradition in apologetic contexts, when they are defending catholic
faith against its detractors. On the other, they draw up summaries of faith
for the purpose of instructing new converts. We must not underestimate the
importance which the preservation and transmission of the apostolic mem-
ory had for the churches of the post-apostolic period. The impartation of
Christian teaching to inquirers and learners was a constant in the life of
these churches. Allusions to this process of instruction in ethical and theo-
logical exhortations demonstrate that catechesis “served as a control with
considerable effect on the understanding of the Christian faith.”3
    We ought to bear in mind that there were no systems yet designed for
presenting the Christian faith, certainly no theological textbooks or “Sunday
school” type of materials offering a rudimentary outline of Christian belief
and practice. The practice of a catechumenate—a series of steps that leads
the new believer to baptism and a deeper knowledge of the faith—was    
created by the early Fathers. It was, in effect, the first version of “Sunday
school,” though a temporary schooling with specific aims.
    What little we know about the mechanics of catechetical process in the
second and third centuries is that the actual teaching of catechumens was
done by those who were specially appointed to serve as catechists. Given
that most “congregations” were house churches, the work of catechizing
new believers took place in the catechist’s own dwelling or some designated
spot. When Justin (the Martyr) was arrested in his apartment in Rome, it
turns out that there were with him six others whom he was teaching, pre-
sumably preparing them for baptism. All seven were executed shortly there-
after for their faith. Likewise, the arrest of Vibia Perpetua took place when
the authorities suddenly burst into a catechetical “class.” Perpetua was im-
prisoned and later martyred with four other catechumens and their catechist
in the amphitheater at Carthage on March 7, 203. Simply being taught the
Christian faith was no less hazardous than outwardly professing Christ.4

    Many other well-known Christian intellectuals of the era were cate-
chists. Clement of Alexandria was a leading catechist for the church of  
Alexandria, as was his most famous pupil, Origen. Almost as renowned  
was Didymus, the chief catechist of Alexandria in the early fourth century,
                                                   who was made blind by

earliest evidence for the process indicates that it varied from place to place,
a basic structure seems to run throughout.
origin s of c ate c h eti c al in s tr u c tion
     For the early Christians, theology (or what the ancients called “the    
true philosophy”) was not a metaphysical exercise detached from the intel-
lectual, spiritual, and liturgical needs of congregations.  It was an organic
phenomenon; it grew out of the communities which heard the Scriptures
and professed the faith. The seed of the Church’s early faith bloomed into
various expressions of Bible commentary, creedal statements, doctrinal
explanations, hymns, and so on, which articulated in a few words a basic
understanding of the Christian Bible and its profession. For good reason   
we may characterize the Church from the earliest moment of its existence  
as a teaching church.6
     The earliest known catechism is a Jewish-Christian outline of ethics
known as the “Two Ways.” Jewish in origin, it was immediately adopted in
Christian circles by the early second century. Three versions of it have come
down to us in the Epistle of Barnabas 18-19, the Didache, and much later in
book VII of the Apostolic Constitutions. It begins with the words, “There are
two ways, one of life (or light) and one of death (or darkness); and between
the two ways there is a great difference.” What follows is a series of ethical
injunctions, based on the Sermon on the Mount, directly quoting from Mat-
thew 5 and Luke 6. Jesus’ teaching on the lifestyle for the Kingdom of God
is taken at face value and embraced as authentic Christian living. The cat-
echetical nature of the these injunctions is made clear from that fact that
     	                           Considering Catechism for Suspicious Protestants   23




they are issued within the context of a congregation: among other things  
the reader is urged to honor those “who preach God’s word to you” (Did-
ache 4.1), all forms of schism among believers are condemned (4.3), and the
confession of sins in the church assembly before offering prayer is said to  
be “the way of life” (4.14). Seeing how the “Two Ways” is immediately    
followed by baptismal instructions in both the Didache and the Apostolic
Constitutions underscores its adaptation by churches as part of a catechism.
     An acknowledged handbook of catechetical instruction from this period
is Irenaeus’ Proof of the Apostolic Preaching, a late second-century work that
survives today only in a sixth-century Armenian translation. The addressee
of the work, the same Marcianus mentioned above, is told that its aim is to
“set forth in brief the preaching of the truth” by providing “in brief the
proof (or exposition) of the things of God,” i.e., a concentrated explanation
of God’s unfolding plan for salvation. This condensed narration of God’s
redemptive activity was in keeping with a didactic format that naturally
lent itself to catechetical purposes.
     Irenaeus begins by declaring that our faith “admonishes us to remember
that we have received baptism for the remission of sins in the name of God
the Father, and in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became
incarnate and died and was raised, and in the Holy Spirit of God” (c. 3).
Doctrinal elaboration immediately follows this baptismal formula, evidently
drawing on the profession of faith that was accepted in the Gallic churches.
Irenaeus here lays out the basis “of our faith, the foundation of the building,
and the consolidation of a way of life”:
    God the Father, uncreated, beyond grasp, invisible, one God the
    maker of all; this is the first and foremost article of our faith. But the
    second article is the Word of God, the Son of God, Christ Jesus our
    Lord, who was shown forth by the prophets according to the design
    of their prophecy and according to the manner in which the Father
    disposed; and through Him were made all things whatsoever. He
    also, in the end of times…became a man among men, visible and
    tangible, in order to abolish death and bring to light life, and bring
    about the communion of God and man. And the third article is the
    Holy Spirit, through whom the prophets prophesied and the patri-
    archs were taught about God…and who in the end of times has been
    poured forth in a new manner upon humanity over all the earth
    renewing man to God. (c. 6)
The Trinitarian pattern, or “three articles,” is not fashioned by Irenaeus,   
but more likely comes from baptismal confession of faith already used in
the West at that time.7 It becomes the doctrinal anchor for the rest of the   
catechetical manual, and Irenaeus concludes the work by warning readers
against doctrinal errors about “God the Father our maker…and the Son of
24        Catechism




God and the dispensation of his incarnation which the apostles transmitted
to us…and the gifts of the Holy Spirit” (c. 99).
    The Apostolic Tradition (ca. 220), one of the numerous works attributed
to Hippolytus, provides unique insight into the worship and organizational
practices of the church in Rome. It is intentionally conservative and even
recalcitrant since Hippolytus seems to have been writing against what he
considered to be recent innovation in the church’s teaching; as a result, we
cannot be exactly clear whether it represents the instruction given in the
church at Rome or the idiosyncratic views of one man. When comparing   
the Apostolic Tradition with the content of other Christian confessions and
liturgies we are probably justified in thinking that this document reflects  
the broader spectrum of Christian teaching, just as it claims explicitly to be
recording only the forms and customs already long-established.
    Catechumens, when they were standing in the waters of baptism after a
three-year period of instruction and probation, were asked to confirm their
faith by responding to the following questions (21.12-18):
     Do you believe in God the Father Almighty?
     Do you believe in Christ Jesus, the Son of God,
        who was born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,
        who was crucified in the days of Pontius Pilate,
        and died [and was buried],
        and rose the third day living from the dead,
        and ascended into heaven,
        and sat down at the right hand of the Father,
        and will come to judge the living and the dead?
     Do you believe in the Holy Spirit in the Holy Church, and the resurrec-
        tion of the flesh?
    This type of interrogatory format is more characteristic of baptismal for-
mulas than of catechetical summaries. The latter were more fluid formulae
of the faith and they became the predecessors of the Rule of faith that was
being used by the middle of the second century as a test of orthodoxy.
E v ol u tion of Cate c h eti c al I n s tr u c tion
    The instruction of new believers became more sophisticated in the
fourth century with the convergence of several trends: greater doctrinal
sophistication due to the Trinitarian and Christological debates, the rise of
several generations of highly educated and erudite Christian thinkers, and
the influx of very many new Christians now that the persecutions were
over. The structures for Christianizing converts were more carefully and
consistently defined.8
    A new stage was added in the catechetical process. “Catechumen”
became the term for anyone who had enrolled for baptism but had not yet
begun the actual period of instruction. In theory and in practice persons
     	                          Considering Catechism for Suspicious Protestants   25




could be regarded as catechumens for years before they took the next step.
Many Christians in military or imperial positions took this route, putting  
off their actual baptism until they were near death because the demands     
of office required acts of killing, torture, limited participation in old pagan
rites, and so on, that were inconsistent with the life of the baptized believer.
Emperor Constantine availed himself of this flexibility. Once catechumens
proved the intentional sanctity of their life and began to attend the weekly
and then daily meetings of instruction (usually held in the period before
Easter), they became competens, that is, were qualified to go on to the next
stage.9
     The seriousness with which Christian leaders took pre- and post-baptis-
mal instruction is evident in how meticulously they formulated and taught
the faith. The anonymous writer of the Apostolic Constitutions makes clear
that competentes should become acquainted with the truths about God’s
identity as Father, Son, and Spirit, and that the one God is truly a Trinity.   
It is this God and no other being or force who made and orders the world
and whose laws have given guidance throughout history, tailored for each
stage. The convert should discover both the truth about his own created
nature and that he stands responsible before God for freely following after
the good and the true according to catholic faith.10
     Augustine (354-430) offers a review of the fundamental elements of the
Christian faith in On Catechizing the Unlearned and the Enchiridion. Gregory
of Nyssa (ca. 335-after 394) does much the same thing in his Address on Cat-
echetical Instruction. Without ever mentioning the creed, Gregory presents a
theological narrative of salvation history, supported by scriptural references
and allusions, defending a pro-Nicene/Constantinopolitan position on the
Trinity. He calls this narrative the “gospel revelation,” and its overall end   
is to show both how “[God] is united to us in so far as he sustains existing
things [as creator]” and that “he united himself with our nature in order
that by its union with the Divine, it might become divine.”11
     A number of sermons and addresses from this period show that the cat-
echizing process was becoming more formalized and unified as the Church
received an ever larger number of converts. A female pilgrim to Jerusalem
named Egeria in the later fourth century alludes to the elaborate preparato-
ry steps which catechumens had to undergo during the forty-day period
before Easter.12 She observes that not only the creed but also instruction on
doctrinal and moral issues were imparted to the new believers. The actual
course of instruction is outlined in a set of addresses delivered by Cyril, the
Bishop of Jerusalem, to baptismal candidates during Lent (probably in 350).
    Now the one and only faith that you are to take and preserve in the
    way of learning and professing is being committed to you by the
    Church as confirmed throughout the Scriptures. For seeing that not
    everyone can read the Scriptures, some because they lack the learn-
26        Catechism




     ing [i.e., they are illiterate], and others because, for one reason or
     another, they find no opportunity to get to know them, we can
     acquire the whole doctrine of the Christian faith in a few articles  
     and so prevent any soul from being lost by not learning the faith.
         At this stage listen to the exact form of words [i.e., the Jerusalem
     creed] and memorize this faith, leaving it to the appropriate time
     when each article it contains may be built up from Holy Scripture.
     For these articles of our faith were not composed out of human opin-
     ion, but are the principal points collected out of the whole of Scrip-
     ture to complete a single doctrinal formulation of the faith. And just
     as the mustard seed contains many future tree branches within its
     tiny grain, so also this faith embraces in a few phrases all the reli-
     gious knowledge contained in the Old and New Testaments togeth-
     er. Be sure, brothers, to “hold the traditions” [2 Thessalonians 2:15]
     which are being imparted to you, and “write them on the table of
     your hearts” [Proverbs 7:3].13
    Cyril shows the catechumens that nothing in the church creed is con-
trary to the biblical message. Being schooled in the creed’s particularities
was the first step not only in learning what the Bible means, but also in   
preparing to read the Bible with insight.
    He urges his listeners to persevere with the intensive classes of instruc-
tion because the goal is to arm them against error and provide a solid foun-
dation for the Christian life. Cyril proceeds to lay forth “indispensable
teachings” on God, on Christ’s divinity, incarnation, and passion, on the
Holy Spirit, on the soul and body, on bodily resurrection, on the centrality
of Scripture, and on the catholic church. Besides the sessions of instruction,
the catechumens were required to renew their repentance, to show the puri-
ty of their intention, and to take seriously their preparation for baptism.
Ste p s in Cate c h e s i s
    Integral to the catechumenate process was confiding the local church’s
creed to the candidates’ memory and understanding. For this very reason,
the creed was not something for writing down. It was to be handed over to
the mind and dwelt upon in the heart so that it became a part of the believ-
er’s spiritual formation. As Augustine commented to catechumens in North
Africa, “The creed builds you up in what you ought to believe and confess
in order to be saved.”14 This process of giving over and explaining the creed
to catechumens was called traditio symboli (symbolum being the Greek word
for the Latin creditum or creed, and traditio meaning literally handing over
or delivering up, whether documents or concepts).
    As the final stage of preparation before the actual baptism, the traditio
was held off in many churches until Holy Week, and given on the Sunday
before Easter. This is how it was in Milan during the time of Ambrose        
    	                          Considering Catechism for Suspicious Protestants   27




(c. 340-397), who described the creed as a “spiritual seal, which is our
heart’s meditation and, as it were, an ever present guard.”15
     But the culmination of the delivering the church’s faith was the redditio
symboli—the believer publicly giving back (reciting by memory) the creed
before the congregation. Augustine calls the act of personally professing the
church’s creed a “holy martyrdom,” “a holy witness to the truth of God.”16
What had been received from God was now being offered back to God as    
a symbol of the believer’s commitment. Without this part of the process,    
the catechism was not complete. For this redditio was also an act of worship
for the new believer; it was his vocal response to God, affirming the truths
received before the congregation. In Sermon 215 Augustine explains the
future implications of redditio or this last stage of catechesis:
   So you have received and given back what you must always retain
   in mind and heart, what you should recite in bed, think about in the
   streets, and not forget over your meals; in which even when your
   bodies are asleep your hearts should be awake. (215.1)17

Cate c h eti c al I n s tr u c tion toda y
     We need to take note of the ancient church’s focus on catechesis, that   
is, on carefully instructing recent converts or those preparing for baptism
about the biblical and doctrinal fundamentals of the Christian faith. In the
preface to his manual of Christian instruction, Gregory of Nyssa declared
that “religious catechism is
an essential duty of the
leaders ‘of the mystery of
our religion’ (1 Timothy        Cyril shows the catechumens that nothing in
3:16). By it the Church is
enlarged through the addi-
                                the church creed is contrary to the biblical
tion of those who are saved,
while ‘the sure word which
                                message. Being schooled in the creed’s par-
accords with the [Church’s]     ticularities was the first step not only in
teaching’ (Titus 1:9) comes
within the hearing of unbe-     learning what the Bible means, but also in
lievers.”18
     We are acting in accord    preparing to read the Bible with insight.
with Gregory’s remarks
when we insist that new
Christians or new members be taught much more than the congregation’s
leadership structure and polity, stewardship plan, and mission statement,  
or be given a brief denominational summary. Too often we assume potential
church members already know the fundamentals of their faith, whereas in
reality they are incapable of explaining even the basics of “the pattern of
sound teaching” (2 Timothy 1:13).
28        Catechism




    To introduce new believers to the Church of Jesus Christ is to open for
them the treasures of the central points of the apostolic faith and practice—
a faith that is larger than any one denomination’s or church’s claims upon
it—sharpened and transmitted through the ages. This need for equipping
cannot be displaced in favor of simply giving one’s own testimony anymore
than to imagine personal experience of the faith can be substituted for a  
reasonable grasp of that faith. To do so would be like handing out magical
amulets for new believers to wear simply as emblems of a faith being used,
but not grasped.
    If it is the case that the Church, as the Apostle phrased it, “is the pillar
and foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15), then ecclesiastical leadership
must not shirk from the critical and time-consuming job of imparting Chris-
tian truth or catechizing those who profess to be Christian. Sunday school
may or may not succeed at this task, and it cannot be left to sermons alone.
In this information age where so many claims to religious truth compete in
print or cyberspace, the need for imparting the Church’s historic tradition is
just as critical as it was for ancient Christianity. Nothing can replace the for-
mation of a theologically and biblically literate people. Nothing is more
essential.

   9 This period of instruction was called the Quadragesima, or the “fortieth,” because it
occurred in the forty days before Holy Week (though some areas took a longer period of

of instructing catechumens for (what was later called) Lent had become generally estab-

to forget how intent, how anxious, we were over what the catechists taught us when we

             Introducing Children
                  to Worship

             We don’t introduce children to worship to make them
             good but rather that they will know who they are. We trust
             that worship which is attentive to the gospel’s grand story
             will transform their lives (and ours), will feed their imag-
             inations not their egos, and will help them (and us) learn
             to order our lives by the gift of God’s time.




P
        opular opinion about children in worship usually tends toward one  
        of two extremes: children are naturally spontaneous, vulnerable, and
        filled with wonder, and thus are often better disposed to worship
than are adults; or church does not come naturally to children and so train-
ing for worship, ideally undertaken outside of the worshiping assembly, is  
a must. As with most starkly opposed observations the truth lies somewhere
in between. I will chart a middle path, one which assumes that children
bring good instincts and often profound insights to the practice of Christian
worship, but that preparation for their participation—and ongoing cateche-
sis as they mature in it—are essential. As will become evident, though, I
part company with those who believe that a certain level of training is nec-
essary before children can meaningfully participate in the Sunday service.
     It will also be important to say some things about worship generally,
since what we mean by that word has everything to do with what we
believe we are introducing children to. Only when we are clear on the
nature and purpose of worship can we say something useful about what     
it means to initiate and habituate children into the practices, the discipline,
and the joy of Christian worship. To do this, I’d like to use the following
terms as markers or guides for our discussion: story, imagination, and time.

Each of them has something important to communicate about worship,   
and each is also a term associated in various ways with children or child-
hood. For example, I will note that worship which follows the church year is
shaped by an alternative ordering of time—one that is counter to the secular
calendar and to the Hallmark holiday schedule—and which forms the iden-
tity, habits, and dispositions of worshipers and congregations over time. And
even though they often appear resistant to time-bound practices and rituals,
children also negotiate the world through a series of time-related activities
(story time, nap time, supper time, bed time) that help to order their under-
standing of who they are and how the world works. In exploring these con-
nections, I hope to illuminate the practices of the Church’s worship in ways
that might be enriching for the work of initiating children into the Christian
life and for sustaining their interest and involvement as they grow into
mature followers of Christ.
T ell Me a Stor y
     Christian worship is, in a most basic sense, the enactment of a story.     
In acts of praise and thanksgiving—prayer, song, sermon, sacrament—we
tell and tell again the grand cosmic narrative of God’s redeeming activity in
the world: the story of how God’s overflowing love created the world and
all that is; how a people (Israel) were called into covenantal relationship
with God; how God was made known in the person of Jesus, mending the
breach created by human waywardness and infidelity; how God birthed the
Church as a sign, servant, and foretaste of the reign of shalom intended for
all of creation; and how, in God’s time, that reign will be realized, utterly
and joyfully. In telling this story in worship, we do certain things: we bap-
tize, which is a way of incorporating persons (and their stories) into this
cosmic drama. We eat a simple meal together, in which consuming bread
and wine makes possible the transformation of a people into sharers in the
divine life and bearers of God’s mercy and justice. As we enact this drama
week to week, year to year, we realize that this story takes practice, for there
are other stories and storytellers seeking to incorporate us into their narra-
tives, insisting that their plotlines are definitive for our own identity and
self-understanding.
     In the current ecclesial climate, however, story is not a term or category
exerting serious influence in most congregational discussions about wor-
ship. Instead, as we find ourselves at least a decade into what have bleakly
been dubbed the “worship wars,” style not story is the evaluative category  
of choice. Style-driven worship is planned, promoted, and produced with    
a straightforward question in mind (whether or not it is articulated this
straightforwardly): What is the basic worship preference of today’s discrimi-
nating congregant-consumer? Quiet, contemplative worship? “Rock and roll
church”? Hymnody, liturgy, vestments, and choral singing? A mixing and
matching of all of the above? Accommodating these wide-ranging prefer-
32      Catechism




ences seems not only reasonable but faithful, as many worship leaders
understand their primary task to be that of “meeting people where they
are.” But a preoccupation with style and preference puts the wrong subject
at the center of the discussion (and indeed of worship itself), for the proper
question to ask when planning and executing worship is not “What do peo-
ple like?” but “What is God doing?” Style customizes worship and compart-
                                                    mentalizes worshipers.
                                                    Story does something else.

Church’s story, Christians believe, does even believe,       does even more: it
                                                    tells us who (and whose)
                                                    we are. Thus the Bible’s
more: it tells us who (and whose) we are.           rightful home—the place
                                                    where it becomes the
                                                    Church’s normative rule  
for faith and practice—is worship, for that is where the depth and breadth
of Scripture, its complexity and ambiguity, its world-making and life-chang-
ing power, unfolds over time, drawing us into its story-world, bidding us to
linger in it, to take it on as our own habit of being in the world. This occurs
in profound ways when, say, a deep saturation in the Lenten scriptures
(preached, prayed, and sung every year in worship) educates our desires,
helping us to resist the temptation to power (or status or comfort) and to
embrace the cross and suffering for Jesus’ sake as the way of discipleship.
And it occurs in simple (but perhaps no less profound) ways when a three-
year-old parades around the house for weeks after Palm Sunday shouting
“Hosanna! Hosanna!” using any object at hand as a make-shift palm branch.
With attentive guidance, her parents can help her claim this gesture of
praise and adoration as constitutive of her Christian identity, even as they
help her to grow into a more mature understanding of the story’s thornier
context and questions.
    Children need to hear the Bible’s stories in worship—not because they
will understand them better there, but because that is where the stories do
their formative work, shaping a people week after week, season after season,
year after year, for work and witness in the world. When we use the Bible’s
stories to impart pious moralisms to children (“be good,” “be helpful,” “be
nice to your brother”) we minimize Scripture’s real purpose and power, and
we fail to teach our children that they, along with us, are called to enter its
narrative world and to be shaped by God’s desire for communion with all  
of creation. In worship—in the hearing of the Word, the preaching of it, and
     	                                        Introducing Children to Worship   33




the performance of it through gestures, postures, and holy sign-acts—chil-
dren and the rest of us enter that world and have the hope of being trans-
formed by its vision. 	Yet all of this is moot if we are more concerned with
style and personal preference than with the story. And if we are, our chil-
dren will learn to be, too.
U s e Yo u r I m agination
    In his book Wishful Thinking, Frederick Buechner says this about the
Lord’s Supper:
    It is make-believe. You make believe that the one who breaks the
    bread and blesses the wine is not the plump parson who smells       
    of Williams’ Aqua Velva but Jesus of Nazareth. You make believe
    that the tasteless wafer and cheap port are his flesh and blood. You
    make believe that by swallowing them you are swallowing his life
    into your life and that there is nothing in earth or heaven more
    important for you to do than this.1
For those who look upon worship with great seriousness, Buechner’s de-
scription may seem a little impertinent. The solemnity with which genera-
tions of Christians have come to regard the Eucharist makes it difficult to
approach the holy meal (literally and figuratively) with much humor or
light-heartedness. But Buechner’s playful depiction is on target, I think,    
for in the Eucharist, as in worship generally, we see and describe things   
differently. We imagine a different world. Imagination understood this way
does not refer to the imaginary—to subjective flights of fancy or whimsical
dreaming—but to a community’s practice of construing reality according to
a particular vision, in full awareness of other options, other visions, other
ways of seeing.2 Imagination names the capacity of a people who in their
worship together perform and give life to a story that subsumes all other
stories. And so we might say that Christian worship is neither about prepar-
ing us for life in the “real world” nor for giving us refuge from it for a little
while; instead, worship is, as Jacques Maritain once said of poetry, “the
‘recomposition’ of a world more real than the reality offered to the senses.”3
     In the Eucharist we enact an alternative set of practices and patterns for
living, and imagine a different way of being in the world and in relationship
with others. Where the so-called real world prizes autonomy and indepen-
dence, Christians at the Lord’s Table practice mutuality and dependence on
God and one another. Against a culture shaped by the alienating forces of
consumer capitalism, the Eucharist forms a community constituted by for-
giveness, reconciliation, and a radical sharing of the goods that make our
life possible. In the context of an economic system based on scarcity and
lack and a political system driven by suspicion, distrust, and the will-to-
power, eucharistically shaped Christians imagine and practice an economics
of abundance and a politics of peace.
34      Catechism




     Children, we know, have a great capacity for imaginative engagement
with the world around them. As already noted, children readily enter the
world created by a good story (and they usually know a good story from a
not-so-good one). When we communicate with confidence and conviction
that Christian worship invites us to inhabit this world of God’s extravagant
grace and goodness, most children will be eager for the adventure and chal-
lenge of living in such a world. And because most children are keen observ-
ers of what goes on around them, appropriate, ongoing catechesis at church
and at home will help them discern the disconnect between what occurs in
worship and the workings of the world around them. As they mature, they
will need continued guidance as they reflect on the implications of this dis-
connect for the Church’s witness and for their own efforts at faithful living.
     And since repetition is the key to effective pedagogy, we must regularly
communicate to children (and their parents) that they are integral to the
whole worshiping body gathered weekly to imagine and practice God’s
world into being, and that their presence and participation are not merely
tolerated but happily anticipated. When we “dismiss” children from the
worshiping body (say, for “children’s church”), no matter how well-inten-
tioned our efforts at teaching them about worship, we convey to them and to
all others present that dividing the worshiping body is an acceptable norm.
More importantly, we rob children of the gift of being formed by the regular
habit, discipline, and joy of corporate worship—which is really how they
learn it and learn to love it in the first place.
     All of this, of course, takes work. It takes patience, preparation, flexibi-
lity, much good humor, and a great deal of creativity and resourcefulness.  
It requires that those in positions of leadership possess a deep theology of
worship and the necessary skill to impart it persuasively and consistently
and graciously to adults and to children. It recognizes that for adults in the
pews, worship may be less serene than they would wish since children can
be noisy and demanding. (It may mean, in fact, that the adults in a congre-
gation, more than the children, will need to be “introduced to worship.”)
     But it is also important to insist that worship should not cater to chil-
dren, since to do so is to give in to the pressures of accommodating style
and preference and the temptation to appeal to a target audience. Rather,
worship that seeks above all else to enact God’s story of redemption and to
imagine God’s politics of peace invites and expects the participation of the
whole household of faith—young and old, rich and poor, the able and the
infirm—with the understanding that, in regard to young children especially,
there are privileges reserved for their maturity, and mysteries and riches of
the worshiping life that reveal themselves as rewards for years of practice
and perseverance. Children should never be the center of attention in wor-
ship (God alone is the object of our devotion) but as children learn about
worship by regularly participating in it, we hope and trust that they will
come to reap those rewards.

W h at T i m e I s I t ?
    If all of this takes work, it also takes time. In worship, thankfully, we are
given the gift of time—the opportunity to be formed as God’s holy people
over the course of our lives. The gift of time reminds us that the end of wor-
ship—its goal or telos—is not entertainment or even personal edification,
but a life transformed by the habit of praise and thanksgiving. In his novel,
Jayber Crow, Wendell Berry’s title character recalls this exchange with a wise
old Bible professor:
       “You have been given questions to which you cannot be given
    answers. You will have to live them out—perhaps a little at a time.”
       “And how long is that going to take?”
       “I don’t know. As long as you live, perhaps.”
       “That could be a long time.”
       “I will tell you a further mystery,” he said. “It may take longer.”4
    In undertaking the task of introducing children to worship we recognize
this gift of time: that we don’t have to do it all at once or say it all at once—
indeed we cannot; and that if we ensure our children’s regular presence in
the worshiping assembly, and couple that commitment with substantive cat-
echesis, the Spirit will do its transforming work with the passage of time.
    We can also communicate to children the ways in which, as worshipers
of God, our personal and corporate lives are ordered by a different sense of
time. Whether our children have been baptized or are looking forward to it
in the future, we can help them come to understand that in baptism we join
the communion of saints through time—past, present, and future—and that
the saints live in God’s
time, time redeemed by the
saving work of Jesus Christ
and measured by the                The end of worship—its goal or telos —is not

that orders the Church’s           entertainment or even personal edification,

make the most of our chil-         but a life transformed by the habit of praise
dren’s natural curiosity
about time (their desire to        and thanksgiving.
learn how to tell time, for
instance) by teaching them
that Christians mark the
passage of time differently through the liturgical calendar. (Frequently
referring to an actual liturgical calendar at home, positioned prominently
alongside the secular calendar that marks family birthdays and soccer
games, is a tangible way to help children learn what it means for the Church
to inhabit time in counter-cultural ways). When we habitually (though not
slavishly) follow the church year in worship, children, like the rest of us,
36      Catechism




come to realize that resistance is often called for. The season of Advent, as
we know, takes place as Christians find themselves besieged by the consum-
er culture’s frenzied Christmas countdown. Yet the scriptures of Advent
and the season’s historic themes and practices encourage not revelry and
guilt-ridden overspending, but a keen alertness to the multiple comings of
                                                   Christ in our lives. In the
                                                   “time” of Advent we enact

                                                   success begins as we wor-
                                                   ship regularly with them,
                                                   and as the whole worship-
ing body imagines faithful ways to witness to God’s story in God’s time. 	
Con c l u s ion
    Introducing children to worship is an act of faithfulness on the part of
the adults who nurture and care for them. It is an act of welcome surrender
in which we trust that the God who claims them in baptism and the Church
that nurtures them through the pilgrimage from birth to death will form
their character and transform their desires, that they might grow in grace
and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. This faithful surrendering often brings
with it the sobering realization that we who seek to have the lives of chil-
dren formed and transformed by participation in corporate worship may
ourselves need to be converted; we may need to have our own vision and
understanding of worship sharpened, tested, and transformed. I have sug-
gested that style-driven worship presents the danger of training children to
be consumers of worship “experiences,” rather than deep adorers of God
who, over time, develop an awareness and appreciation of historic Christian
worship even as they recognize the dynamism and flexibility inherent in
tradition.
    And, finally, we engage in this act of introducing children to worship—
and overseeing their ongoing participation in it—not in an effort to make
them good but that they will know who they are. And we do this with the
hope that worship that is attentive to the gospel’s grand story will do its
transforming work in their lives (and ours), will feed their imaginations not
their egos, and will help them (and us) learn to order our lives by the gift of
God’s time.

     n the beautiful Life in Community, the calligraphers and illuminators of
     The Saint John’s Bible interpret Luke’s description of an ideal Christian
     community in Jerusalem, where “the whole group of those who believed
were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any
possessions, but everything they owned was held in common. With great
power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person
among them…” (Acts 4:32-34a). The artists portray a community of instruc-
tion bound together under the lordship of the risen Christ, reaching from
those earliest days of the Church in Jerusalem down to the Benedictine com-
munity of Saint John’s Abbey in Minnesota, the patron of this manuscript.
     This work is not a new endeavor for the Benedictines, whose communi-
ties of monks have been the calligraphers and illuminators of Bibles for over
fifteen hundred years. Now on the occasion of the second millennium of
Christ’s birth, The Saint John’s Bible has been created “to inspire a renewed
love of Scripture intertwined with art.”1 The Bible is a gift from the Saint
John’s community to all Christians, to enhance their worship and serve their
catechesis for generations to come. As the first handwritten and illuminated
Bible commissioned since the invention of the printing press in the late fif-
teenth century, it is “the one thing we’ll probably be remembered for 500
years from now,” writes Eric Hollas, OSB, a monk at Saint John’s Abbey  
and Associate Director of Arts and Culture at Saint John’s University who
has been instrumental throughout the project.2
     The Saint John’s Bible grew out of a meeting between the distinguished
calligraphic artist Donald Jackson and Fr. Hollas in 1995. Jackson, a native
of Lancashire, England, decided at a young age that he wanted to do two
things with his talent—to become the “Queen’s Scribe” and to inscribe and
illuminate the Bible. He achieved the first goal when he became scribe to
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s Crown Office at the House of Lords at age
twenty-six, and he will achieve the second in 2009 when The Saint John’s
Bible is completed.
     The patron raised four million dollars over eight years from individuals,
groups, and corporations. Then, on Ash Wednesday in the year 2000, Jack-
son penned the first words of The Saint John’s Bible; they were the opening
40    Catechism




verses of the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, the Word was God.”3
     Jackson calls this project his “Sistine Chapel.” In the medieval workshop
tradition, he oversees the work of ten designers, illustrators, and illumina-
tors at a scriptorium in Wales. Some of the artists return to their own stu-
dios with the pages after receiving direction from Jackson.4
     The original manuscript of The Saint John’s Bible will be bound in seven
volumes (15 ¾” wide by 23 ½” tall when closed) with a total of 1150 pages
and 160 illuminations. The lettering was devised by Jackson and replicated
by the scribes. The Bible is inscribed on vellum (calf skin or parchment)
using swan, goose, and turkey quills, natural handmade inks, hand-ground
pigments, and gold leaf. Over 250 skins have been rubbed and sanded; on
thinner pages lines were drawn for writing, and thicker skins were prepared
for the illuminations. The volumes of the original manuscript will be a
source for religious, artistic, educational, and scholarly programming and
exhibitions. Selected pages are currently on tour throughout North Ameri-
ca.5 Reproductions of the Bible are being produced at sixty-two percent of
actual size (9 ¾” x 15”) for purchase by congregations and individuals.
     The text is carefully arranged on each spacious page to encourage read-
ers to notice the lettering and ponder its meaning. In contemporary artistic
jargon, this is truly a project of “mark-making.” The illuminators use egg
yolk to bind the colors together and give the images great luminosity, a
technique borrowed from the tempera panel paintings in the Renaissance. In
another ancient practice, thin slices of gold leaf are placed on gesso (sugar,
fish glue, whole lead powder, and slate plaster) and then on to the vellum.
The Saint John’s Bible also incorporates modern themes, contemporary illus-
trations, and production technology of the twenty-first century. The pages
of completed volumes may be viewed in their entirety online.6
     In a significant departure from medieval practice, the words of Scrip-
ture are presented in English rather than Latin. The use of the New Revised
Standard Version translation shows the influence of the project’s Protestant
and Jewish advisors. Its predecessor, the Revised Standard Version of the
Bible, had the distinction of being officially authorized for use by all major
Christian churches—Protestant, Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Eastern
Orthodox. The NRSV is a modern English translation that maintains tradi-
tional references to God but uses gender-inclusive language for humanity  
in an unobtrusive manner.
     I will discuss three images—Life in Community, Life of Paul, and Birth of
Christ—as examples of the wonderful artwork in The Saint John’s Bible.

that was used through fifteenth-century Christian art to indicate supernatu-

in his left hand the open book displays not the expected Alpha and Omega
letters, but the English words “I AM.” On either side is an attending angel.

script’s patron. An inverted U-shape aligns both the seated group of men
and women and the table at which they are to dine. In the center foreground
is an altar table on which a single candle, Gospel book, loaf of bread, and
chalice holding red wine are present. The flatness of the composition be-
comes evident when you think about how the feet seem to just be sliding
down towards the table and what would happen if the figures were to
stand.
     The text of Acts 4:32-34 is written in the four quadrants defined by the
circular figural area. The triangular shape of these corners is reminiscent of
pendentives, the structural features in a Byzantine church building that sup-
port the weight of its massive circular dome over the square space where
the altar is located. The pendentives unify the most basic geometric shapes,
the circle and the square. Here, too, the words unify the figural illumination
with God; they tell the story that is visually depicted in the illumination and
inspired by God.
     The action of instruction, or catechism, in this image centers upon a
meal (the Eucharist) within a meal. The Virgin Mary sits at the middle of the
table. The twelve Apostles
surround her, six on her
right and six on her left. In

    A highlight of the artwork in the Book of Acts is the full-page illumina-
tion, Life of Paul, which blends traditional method and iconography with
contemporary imagery and symbolism. Usually when the Apostle is depict-
ed in art, the subject is his dramatic encounter with the risen Christ on the
road to Damascus (Acts 9:3-6). The text above Paul—“I saw a light from
                                                  Catechism in Christian Art   45




heaven” (Acts 26:13; cf. 9:3 and 22:6)—refers to that event, but the symbols
painted around him reference his later journeys and ministry. Traveling by
the boat on the blue seas beneath his feet, Paul communicates the koinonia,
or fellowship of the Christian community, to the great cities of the world.
These cities, ancient and modern, are represented by a mélange of Turkish,
Byzantine, Near Eastern, French Romanesque, Italian Renaissance, and   
contemporary buildings. Integrated into the sea waves at the bottom are   
the words of Paul and Barnabas’s call, “I have set you to be a light for the
Gentiles, so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth” (Acts
13:47). Though he is clothed in first-century robes, Paul is holding models  
of two later church buildings: an Italian Renaissance dome in one hand   
and an Orthodox style building in the other. The Apostle literally holds    
the Church, West and East, in his hands.
    Even the technique of this illumination, reminiscent of both a Byzantine
mosaic and a twentieth-century collage, bridges past knowledge with mod-
ern experiment. A mosaic traditionally used cut pieces of glass or stone to
form (when viewed from a distance) a figure with a black outline around
the shape; the heavy linear quality of many of the buildings echoes this type
of silhouetted form. On the other hand, the use of color, the overlapping of
the figures, and the flatness of the composition are typical of a modern col-
lage method. Light, reflective colors—reminiscent of the Venetian paintings
of Titian and Girogione—are used in the upper areas of the painting where
the lines are blurred as the buildings shift into abstract forms. The strong,
vibrant colors in the middle of the painting are more similar to the more
acidic tones of some American realists during the Industrial Revolution.
Birt h of C h ri s t
    The Birth of Christ illumines the opening page of the Gospel of Luke,
which contains the story of the angels announcing Christ’s birth to shep-
herds (Luke 2:8-20). “Luke features more angels than any of the other evan-
gelists. After these appearances, there are usually marvelous songs of praise
and thanksgiving,” notes Michael Patella, OSB, chair of The Saint John’s Bible
Committee on Illumination and Text.10 Immediately above the angels at the
top of the painting are their words of praise to God, written vertically in
two columns. The gold of their wings guide our eyes down a dense vertical
slab of golden light that culminates in the crib of Jesus. Jesus is present but
remains unseen in his mystery.
    Surrounding the crib on the left are the shepherds—both male and
female, and one is holding a baby—and the farm animals. On the right side
are Mary and Joseph, and the silhouette of a bull taken from the cave paint-
ings in Lascaux, France. Patella, who assisted the illuminators in the icon-
ography of the images, believes that the shepherds in ancient Palestine (as
they are today) were predominantly women and that although they are usu-
ally depicted as adolescent boys, it should not be assumed that they were all

men.11 The placement of the Lascaux bull (15,000-13,000 b.c.), which is one  
of the earliest known achievements of human creativity, emphasizes the
humanity of Christ in a unique way. Instead of using the traditional iconog-
raphy of an ox and lamb (often thought now to be anti-Semitic), The Saint
John’s Bible illuminator depicts an animal known to and painted by human
beings for as long as we have recorded evidence.

above the Lascaux bull in a lyrical, fluid script. Iconographically it connects
the birth with the passion of Christ. Across the lower section of the page in
yet another style of calligraphy is the beginning of Zechariah’s sentence,
“By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon
us” (Luke 1:78). The golden slab of light that bisects the image and radiates
from the manger now represents the beginning of a new day for humanity.
     The colors and composition of this illumination are similar to medieval
nativity scenes in stained glass window cycles, like the beautiful one in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame in Chartres, France, which is located southwest   
of Paris. Nativity, one of thirty scenes composing the Infancy of Christ win-
dow, was created between 1145 and 1155. It survived the fire that destroyed
all but the west façade of the cathedral (and much of the town) in 1194. The
entire window is 11 meters wide by 3.8 meters high and there are nine regis-
ters with three panels in each. The window is much like a mosaic, composed
of small pieces of colored glass that are held together by strips of lead. The
odd-shaped pieces require the hand of a master to assemble them into some-
thing decorous and useful to the worshiper. Like the illuminations in a   
48        Catechism




manuscript, the Chartres windows teach biblical stories and convey spiritu-
al messages to the viewer.
    The two artistic traditions of manuscript illumination and stained glass
worked hand-in-hand in instructing believers during the Middle Ages. Most
parishioners were illiterate. Their understanding of the faith was guided by
public readings from the beautiful handwritten manuscripts of the Bible and
by the interpretations of scriptural themes in the colorful church windows.
    Today we are more familiar with the contemporary recovery and devel-
opment of the stained glass tradition as a way of teaching the central themes
of our faith.12 The Saint John’s Bible seeks to develop the parallel tradition of
manuscript illumination as a visual pathway into the meaning of Scripture.
The artistry of its calligraphers and illuminators may once again instruct
believers and inspire all people by reflecting the spiritual aspirations of the
twenty-first century. As the selected pages from the original manuscript of
the Bible travel to North American venues, they may touch the hearts of
those who view them with the biblical message of forgiveness.

     creation of our own life, our own identity, our own destiny…. We are
    	                                                           Worship         	 53




   even called to share with God the work of creating the truth of our iden-
   tity. We can evade this responsibility by playing with masks, and this
   pleases us because it can appear at times to be a free and creative way of
   living. It is quite easy, it seems, to please everyone. But in the long run
   the cost and the sorrow come very high. To work out our own identity
   in God, which the Bible calls, “Working out our salvation,” is a labor
   that requires sacrifice and anguish, risk and many tears.

   We turn aside from all that has consumed us

   Consume us, O God,

   What more can he say than to you he has said,
   to you that for refuge to Jesus have fled?

   the rivers of woe shall not you overflow;
   for I will be with you, your troubles to bless,
   and sanctify to you your deepest distress.

   How clear is our vocation, Lord,

   and daily learn, refreshed, restored,
   that you are Lord of all,
   and will not let us fall.

   your yoke is hard to bear;
   if worldly pressures fray the mind
   and love itself cannot unwind
   its tangled skein of care:
   our inward life repair.

   We mark your saints, how they became
   in hindrances more sure,
   whose joyful virtues put to shame
   the casual way we wear your name,
   and by our faults obscure
   your power to cleanse and cure.

   In what you give us, Lord, to do,
   together or alone,

    We do not consider ourselves yet to have taken hold of it.
    But one thing we do:
      forgetting what is behind
          and straining toward what is ahead,
      we press on toward the goal to win the prize
          for which God has called us heavenward in Christ Jesus.

             Catechism molds the soul of the believer for a life of
             faithfulness in the world. We must retrieve ancient prac-
             tices that can shape us into the kind of people who will,
             as our second nature, glorify God and enjoy him forever.




T
       o his young disciple Timothy, the apostolic mentor Paul writes, “Now
       you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith,
       my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and suffer-
ing” (2 Timothy 3:10-11). Buried in this list is the cogent phrase “my aim in
life.” Other translations render it “purpose,” but the point is the same and
plain: to live the Christian life one needs to know what one is striving for,
living toward, or aiming at. What is the goal, the ambition, the target?
     The first question of The Westminster Catechism puts the matter this way:
“What is the chief end of man?” The answer to be memorized and recorded
in the soul of the disciple is, “To glorify God and to enjoy him forever.”
     This answer, however, is not self-evident to every human being. It must
be learned and adopted, lest some other aim in life govern a person’s direc-
tion. For example, the American Declaration of Independence declares that the
Creator has endowed all human beings with certain “unalienable Rights,”
among which are “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” Happiness,
unhappily, has become the chief aim of many, even at the expense of the
true pursuit of it. The present possession of personal happiness has become
the secular substitute for the spiritual aim of enjoying God forever. The con-
sequences of this shift in aim are deadly to the soul that is made for satisfac-
tion only by glorifying its Creator.
     A youth minister found himself counseling a high school football player
in his church youth group after the teenager had been suspended from
school for being drunk at a party. The young man was chronically abusing
alcohol; his grades were suffering and his play on the field declining.
    	                                                   Training Our Aim    59




     “What do you want to do with your life,” the youth minister asked.
     “I want to be a lawyer,” the boy replied.
     “And just how do you think you are going to get from here to there on
the path you are going?”
     Our conduct in life reflects our true aim, whether we are conscious of it
or not. If we are primarily interested in immediate pleasure, our behavior
will feed that aim. But if we fix our aim on some higher purpose, we will
more likely train ourselves to live toward that end.
     The Christian life does not happen willy-nilly. “Men are made, not born,
Christians,” the early church Father Tertullian famously claimed in The
Apology (XVIII). He did not mean by that one could not go to heaven unless
one is a finished product. He meant that if one’s aim in life is more than
simply salvation, if it is instead to be shaped into the image of Christ in
order better “to glorify God and enjoy him forever,” then some construction
must take place to build the character and better the conduct of the believer.
     We Baptists have paid less attention to the matter of Christian formation
than they have to eternal salvation. In fact, Tertullian’s dictum might strike
us as very odd, since the experience of being “born again” predominates in
our language when it comes to making Christians. We might easily see that
being born into a Christian nation or to a Christian home or onto the cradle
roll of a Christian congregation does not make one a Christian. Yet we do
not seem to see that being born again is only the beginning of an intentional
life of transformation into the likeness of Christ.
     This aim of learning to glorify God requires work, and yet this training
does not invalidate the agency of divine grace in the human work. Chris-
tians are made by an ongoing process that can be viewed from one side as
grace to grace, and from the other as work to work. Churches that take seri-
ously this grace-work of making Christians will devise means to pass on the
faith and form the character of Christians from generation to generation.
     Catechisms are examples of ways the Church has tried to do just that. A
catechism is a systematic plan of education that involves information and
formation. It presupposes a people—the Church—who live in such a way
that the Christian life is recognizable among them. Catechism requires a
Christian who will model that life to one who is observing it—the way Paul
did for Timothy. And finally, it demands a serious and studious disciple
who wishes to know intimately the “life that really is life” (1 Timothy 6:19).
     Catechisms have been common in churches that baptize infants and rare
in churches that do not. Children that grow up in sacramental churches
have been baptized as infants and then go through catechetical instruction
as part of their confirmation experience in late childhood or early adoles-
cence. By learning the faith in a conscious way, they are better able to take
for themselves the faith that was pledged to them and shaped into them by
parents, godparents, and church leaders. Adult converts similarly undergo
catechetical instruction as a means of putting off the “old self” and putting
60        Catechism




on the “new self,” as the Apostle Paul put it (Ephesians 4:22-24). This tradi-
tionally has taken place before baptism, but has sometimes followed it.
     The Baptist emphasis on Sunday school for all ages and faith stages has
functioned catechistically. Curriculum in children’s departments during the
school-age years includes the main themes covered in typical catechisms:
Who is God? Who are human beings? Who made the world? What is the
                                                      purpose of life? How do
                                                      we please God? What
An intentional approach to catechism is all           rules should conduct be-
                                                      havior? What is the Bible
the more necessary in a time when Christian           and how does it function?

identity is not secure.                                    The story of Jesus
                                                      being tempted by the devil
                                                      in the desert right after his
baptism has a catechetical ring to it (Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13). The devil
plays devil’s advocate, posing questions to Jesus that probe the identity and
mission of the Son of God. He even uses Scripture to trip up Jesus in his
messianic identity and mission. Jesus uses Scripture right back to clarify   
his sense of whom he is in relation to God and what his aim is in life. This
private spiritual encounter in the wilderness serves as a training exercise
that prepares Jesus for his public ministry to follow.
     In the same way, the intentional instruction in the faith that catechism
represents shapes the soul of the believer in a way that prepares her for a
life of faithfulness in the world. Normally, catechisms address faith, ethics,
and prayer by teaching the Apostles’ Creed, the Ten Commandments, and
the Lord’s Prayer, respectively. A question-and-answer format is customari-
ly applied as the disciple learns that her role in life is to be responsive and
accountable to the call of God and the authority of the people of God.
     While Baptists are not creedal people, the creeds or confessions of faith
can serve well in teaching the historic faith to young people and adult con-
verts. In fact, some such intentional approach is all the more necessary in a
time when cultural Christianity has given way to religious pluralism,
wherein Christian identity is not secure. The Church must retrieve ancient
practices that help to shape the people of God into the kind of people that
can, as their second nature, glorify God and enjoy him forever.
     If an American moves to Italy and wants to become as at home in that
country as a native, careful attention to mastering the history, the culture,
and the language is necessary. Just living in Italy does not an Italian make.
To serve the learning better, an accomplished and learned Italian might
serve as a guide. The learning might take a question-and-answer format,
and be structured around routine personal exchanges in various locations
and cultural settings. And, since children learn faster and easier than adults,
the earlier the process begins the better.
     	                                                             Training Our Aim   61




    In the same way, Baptists who wish to form the gospel into people in
the most effective way will do more than announce the good news and
introduce them to the Christian faith. To make Christians that are at home
with God and true citizens of the Kingdom of God will take assimilation
efforts. The Church will find ways to acquaint converts deeply with the
faith: teaching the history of faith (doctrine), training in the codes of Chris-
tian conduct (ethics), and speaking the language of the Spirit (prayer).
    Evangelization will lead to initiation, an initiation into the “life that
really is life.” Christians will learn to train their aim on the chief end of
human beings: “to love God and enjoy him forever.”

             “I wonder what sort of tale we have fallen into,” Sam

             we willing to live with questions of purpose that arise in
             our lives? Will we walk with each other as we discover
             answers that lead to our vocation in God’s world?




A
         daughter catches the last available flight, arriving at her parents’
         home early in the morning. Her grief-stricken father who has just
         returned home from the hospital greets her. A few hours earlier he
called his daughter with the tragic news. The doctor spoke of a massive
heart attack. His wife, her mother, died instantly. Now as the father and
daughter stand face-to-face, they must address the questions arising from
their tragic loss.
     A husband and wife are still in shock. The news came quickly and un-
expectedly. When the couple completed the required paperwork, the case-
worker said it could take up to a year. Yet, here they are, traveling to the
agency to meet their new child. Leaving home, their minds are filled with
all kinds of questions: Will he like us? What kind of parents will we be? Are
we really ready for a son?
     The starting point for questions of meaning is always in the middle.1 In
the middle of a family loss, we wonder how we will live without her. In the
middle of receiving an unexpected gift, we question how life is going to
change.

   You have set your glory above the heavens.
   Out of the mouths of babes and infants
       you have founded a bulwark because of your foes,
       to silence the enemy and the avenger.
   When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
       the moon and the stars that you have established;
   what are human beings that you are mindful of them,
       mortals that you care for them?
   Yet you have made them a little lower than God,
       and crowned them with glory and honor.
   You have given them dominion over the works of your hands;
       you have put all things under their feet,
   all sheep and oxen,
       and also the beasts of the field,
   the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,
       whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
   O Lord, our Sovereign,
       how majestic is your name in all the earth!
   Psalm 8
     The psalmist asks a question of meaning directed to God: “What are
human beings that you are mindful of them, mortals that you care for
them?” (8:4). The psalmist’s question does not arise in a vacuum. Instead,   
it comes in the midst of God’s creation, surrounded by the celestial bodies
that are a result of God’s hands.
     Psalm 8 will not allow us to move too quickly to address its penetrating
question. Before we consider the place of human beings in the divine order
of things, we first must learn something about this God who created the
heavens and “established the moon and the stars” (8:3).
     In introducing God, the psalmist tells of a God whose name is sovereign
over all the earth. Yet the greatness of God is not only seen in the works of
creation, but also in the transformation of words, uttered by helpless babes
and infants, into defense against God’s own foes.

    Cassie was a member of a congregation I served. Each Sunday, our
group of sixty worshipers gathered in the tiny sanctuary. Cassie sat on the
sixth row from the front, on the right side, next to her mother and grand-
mother. At the time, Cassie was still learning the difference between her
“inside” and “outside” voice.
    One particular Sunday, I shared what I thought was a very clever     
children’s message. I could tell that Cassie was less than pleased with the
content of the message. She went back to her seat between her mother and
64        Catechism




grandmother. She showed her displeasure by quickly crossing her arms in
anger. Cassie’s mother asked her what was wrong. Cassie, despite her
mother’s best efforts, used her outside voice so all of us could hear, and  
said, “He didn’t say one thing about Jesus!”
     Another time, our congregation lost a beloved member who happened
to live next door to Cassie. The family scheduled visitation at the local
                                                    funeral home. When I

answer the question, “What are human beings understand this.” She then
                                                    waited for a response
that you are mindful of them?”                      from her pastor.
                                                        Cassie’s simple faith
                                                    gave her the freedom to
ask any question which came to her mind. In a very profound way, Cassie
also viewed the church and its ministers as those charged to hear her ques-
tions, while at the same time helping her fashion a faithful response. Her
words were so meaningful to me that I continue to tell her story thirteen
years later.

                                      
    Psalm 8 introduces us to a complex God. God is the sovereign Lord
whose name is known throughout the earth. At the same time, God seems
willing to risk God’s work and words by sharing power with human beings,
even babes and infants. What a risk!
    By exploring the risk taken by God, as described in Psalm 8, we begin to
find our identity and answer the question, “What are human beings that
you are mindful of them?” (8:4).
    In my brief ministerial career, I have had the privilege of following two
ministers who invested most of their careers in one congregation. I remem-
ber the first time I met with each one of these ministers. While each conver-
sation was different, the theme was the same. Each minister shared his love,
admiration, and good wishes for the congregation he served. As my prede-
cessors shared their pilgrimages with me, I tried to put myself in their
shoes. One gives the very best years of one’s life to a local church and then
hands the role of pastor to someone new. I was overcome with a sense of
humility as I attempted to carry on the work of those who had gone before
me.

    In a sense, Psalm 8 describes a similar conversation between God and
humankind. Human beings are reminded of and even surrounded by the
works of God. In this conversation, God seems to hand over a portion of
God’s work to human beings. The psalmist says it this way: “You have    
given them dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things
under their feet” (8:6). It is in this charge that human beings find their call,
vocation, and ultimately an answer to the psalmist’s previous question.
What is articulated in these few short verses takes a lifetime to fulfill.

    I love the scene in J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings where hobbits
Frodo and Sam talk about the nature of adventures. Prior to their perilous
journey, Sam had believed adventures were something that famous heroes
or heroines went looking for in order to cure their boredom. Now he has
learned that rather than looking for their adventures, these individuals
landed in the midst of their tales, which brought with them a host of un-
settling questions. Sam’s insight leads him to this pressing question in the
midst of his and Frodo’s journey, “I wonder what sort of tale we’ve fallen
into?”2
    Questions of meaning and purpose are asked in the middle of life’s  
troubles and opportunities. Are we, as the people of God, willing to live
with those questions? Are we willing to walk with each other as we dis-
cover answers that lead to our vocation in God’s world?

             First Baptist Church in Richmond, Texas, turned to an his-
             torical method of catechesis to help children frame their
             faith expressions and understand the congregation’s his-
             torical Baptist identity. The catechism class gives a foun-
             dation for their children’s growth as faithful disciples.




T
        he story is often told (at least, within childhood education circles)
        about an itinerate missionary who ministered in rather remote com-
        munities by teaching the children and their families. One day the mis-
sionary entered a new village, gathered the children together, and asked     
if they knew what prayer was. Most of the children excitedly raised their
hands, indicating their eagerness to answer. Calling on one of them, the
missionary was pleasantly surprised, if not shocked, at the child’s sophisti-
cated answer. It was concise and doctrinally correct. The child’s few words
were well chosen and well expressed. The missionary invited another child
to share his answer to the question about prayer, and the same simple,
direct answer was given, word for word. A third child offered the same
answer. The missionary quickly realized that this village had been given  
the gift of a catechism and the people had a foundation for their faith.
     It is apparent within congregations across North America today that our
pews are full of people who cannot give such clear and precise answers to
many questions about doctrine and the history of our faith. The breakdown
is obvious. How do we fix it?
     Especially within my own Baptist denomination there has been much
discussion (and division) over the last three decades concerning our identi-
ty—what doctrines we should believe, what practices we should follow, and
how we should live with one another and before the world. Some interpret-
ers of this Baptist squabbling have concluded that we have lost our identity

and do not know whom we are or what we believe, that we do not know
our historical relationship with one another or within the Church.
    At First Baptist Church in Richmond, Texas, we turned to an historical
way of teaching our children the faith in order to address these two needs—
to help them frame their faith expressions and gain an understanding of our
historical Baptist identity. We developed a program of catechesis in order to
lay a foundation for their future growth as disciples.
    Minister to Children and Education JoAnn Daugherty worked with me
to write and edit the 171 questions and answers in our catechism. She also
developed activities and lesson plans for each class session. Dr. Curtis Free-
man, who was a professor at Houston Baptist University and a member of
our church at the time, guided the development of our catechism.
finding o u r s el v e s a m ong friend s
     Because the church had been open to using diverse literature and curric-
ulum for several years, the suggestion that we form a new children’s class
around questions and answers of our faith was readily accepted. We began
to explore our options.
     The first catechisms that came to mind were those that have stood the
test of time—The Westminster Standard Larger Catechism and the Shorter Cate-
chism of 1647, and the questions and answers found in books of worship,
like the most recent edition of The Book of Common Prayer (1979). Most Bap-
tists are familiar with parts of these historical catechisms, like the opening
question in The Westminster Standard, “What is the chief end of man?” and
its answer, “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him for ever.”
Catechisms from other denominations were explored: our Lutheran friends
shared their books of instruction and local Methodists offered us ideas.
     Then another source came to light. We discovered that Southern Bap-
tists have had catechisms from their beginnings! One of the first documents
printed in 1863 at the newly formed Sunday School Board was A Catechism
of Bible Doctrine by James Boyce, the founder and first president of Southern
Seminary.1 With more research we discovered other Baptist catechisms.   
We reviewed Henry Jessey’s Catechism for Babes, or Little Ones, (Benjamin)
Keach’s Catechism, and A Catechism of Bible Teaching by John A. Broadus.2      
A friend shared a copy of Joining the Church, a pamphlet written by W. A.
Criswell who was the pastor for many years at First Baptist Church of     
Dallas. In this catechism (though he does not use that term), Dr. Criswell
offers questions and answers about the meanings of salvation, baptism, the
Lord’s Supper, and church membership that he felt important for young
inquirers to have before them as they began their discovery of faith.3
     We found many catechisms currently used in the Baptist family. For
example, John Piper, pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, in 1992 revised The Baptist Catechism first developed in Great
Britain in 1689. In his new introduction Piper explains what a catechism     
68      Catechism




is, why it is important, and how it can be used. The word “catechism,” he
notes, comes from a Greek New Testament word, katecheo, which means to
instruct or teach. “It simply means to teach Biblical truth in an orderly way.
Generally this is done with questions and answers accompanied by Biblical
support and explanation.” Piper reveals his motivation for revising The
Baptist Catechism when he urges readers, “Make [its questions and answers]
part of your family routine…. I am excited about being a partner with you
in building a ‘stable and firm’ generation who hopes in God.”4
     First Baptist Church found itself with many friends as it sought a way  
to teach children about our biblical and historical faith.
de v elo p ing a ri c h er v o c a b u lar y
    We began by searching for the words that could help us discern and
share the fullness of our faith. Gaining the words we need to articulate our
faith, to express our thoughts and desires about God, and to grow in our
relationship with God is a treasure of utmost importance. We gain this lan-
guage of faith as the words of Scripture become personal for us and as we
learn hymns and spiritual songs.
    These carefully chosen words of faith allow us to share with another
generation the hope we have in God. The right word at the right time,     
Solomon taught us, “is like apples of gold in a setting of silver” (Proverbs
25:11). Indeed, we lean toward profanity, vanity, and emptiness when we
use words carelessly (at the wrong times or in the wrong ways) in commu-
nicating the intimacy of our relationship with the Triune God.
    Catechesis is about sharing the gift of this language with new believers.
As babies begin to grow, we measure their maturity by they way they use
language—by how many words are in their vocabulary and how they put
those words together into sentences. We watch for when our children begin
to use certain words and expressions, and when they can ask us more inti-
mate questions. It is the same with maturity in Christian faith. New believ-
ers can be taught the right words to use, maybe before they understand
them all. This language of faith will help children in the faith to frame their
most intimate experiences with God in profound, rather than profane, ways.
    Many adult believers, even those who have “grown up in church,” have
a limited understanding of what they believe and an inadequate vocabulary
to express their faith. Their beliefs are still framed in terms of emotional
experiences that have never been measured through theological reflection.
Since they have not learned a creed, they have no clear channel for learning
how to express what they believe, and they are left to discover or develop
their own language of faith. Though these expressions may be genuine, they
are inadequate for voicing a mature faith.
    This often comes out, for example, when I am planning a funeral service
with people of faith. Some have said to me, “I believe in ‘the old rugged
cross,’ pastor. That’s my faith.” Or, “‘Amazing grace that saved a wretch
                                                Laying Foundations of Faith   69




like me’ is my story.” When I ask for further clarification, often they can
give none. “Oh, he walks with me, and talks with me, and tells me I am his
own,” and other snippets from the church hymnal, may be the only creed
and the most significant biblical commentary they have studied to learn a
language to express their faith.
    As helpful and expressive as the words of these hymns may be, our
church has chosen not to limit our faith to that one form of language.
u nder s tanding o u r c h ildren ’ s de v elo p m ent
     Any congregation that seriously commits to a ministry of catechism
must really believe in its children. Why teach them the words of faith if  
they cannot learn or if their learning is not important?
     Teaching children about faith, fortunately, can be much easier than
teaching adults. This is so because many adults are deeply entrenched in the
religious views they hold, and often these are opinions based on emotional
connections to experiences, rather than thought-out truths grounded in their
study of Scripture. When an adult’s views are challenged, especially when
they are held with limited reflection, the results can be tragic. Children are
not yet invested in these emotional connections as deeply as the adults.
They are easier to teach; they are eager for reflection. By the age of twelve,
Jesus knew the importance of asking questions and seeking answers from
the teachers in the Temple (Luke 2:41-52). What an exciting future we open
for our children when we teach them the language of faith as those gifted
teachers taught their language to Jesus.
     As they enter adolescence, our children need expanded categories and   
a framework for thinking in theological ways. In middle school and high
school, they are being
taught to think about  
complex personal, politi-
cal, and moral issues. In      Gaining the words we need to articulate our
the novels they must read,
they are introduced to         faith, to express our thoughts and desires
every major philosophy of
life that they will be asked   about God, and to grow in our relationship
to interpret. They will ex-

and biology at levels that
leave their parents in the
dark. Yet, have we introduced them to a theology that will help them evalu-
ate and dialogue with these other ways of understanding their lives?
     The middle-school years are not too early to begin teaching our children
about systematic theology. That is why we introduce our catechism to our
fifth- and sixth-grade students. They need to know that they can think, and
think hard, about their faith, for they are entering a significant season when

they are being introduced to competing narratives (or, stories of life) the
world offers.
finding t h e rig h t Word s
    During the time when our church developed its catechism, various
Southern Baptist groups were struggling to find the right words about the
Bible, Christ, and living the Christian life as individuals and in community.
Many Baptists had worked over the years to find good words, full of mean-
ing, to articulate their beliefs in confessions and covenants. One of the best
efforts was The Baptist Faith and Message of 1963 (hereafter, BFM). Believing
that the BFM was accurate for understanding and expressing our Baptist
faith, we included in our catechism the text of many of its “articles,” includ-
ing the doctrinal statements on The Scriptures (The Bible), God, God the
Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, Man (God’s People), Salvation,
God’s Purpose of Grace, The Church, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, The
Lord’s Day, and The Kingdom and Last Things. To accompany these articles
we constructed 132 questions and answers that reflect their wording as
closely as possible.
    The BFM brought order, structure, and focus to our catechism; it provid-
ed language that Baptists had developed over several centuries of growing
in understanding and voicing their faith. Working with the 1963 statement
allowed us to address issues related to Baptist identity that were being chal-
lenged in later revisions of this statement of faith.
    We added almost forty questions and answers concerning the Ten Com-
mandments and the Lord’s Prayer, which are important topics covered in
most traditional catechisms. And we borrowed other wonderful questions
and responses from classical Baptist catechisms. For example, we would
fight less about our opinions if we truly understood this insight from   
James Boyce’s catechism:
     Q. Does (the Bible) teach us every thing about God?
     A. It does not; no language could teach us the full glory of God, nor
     could we ever comprehend it.
Wouldn’t it be refreshing to be in a study group where members humbly
shared their comprehension, knew they could not be too dogmatic about a
conclusion, and eagerly awaited your insights? How might Southern Baptist
identity have been transformed during the last thirty years if just this one
question and answer had been lived out?
li v ing w it h v ital Q u e s tion s
    The Apostle Paul was confident that one day we would know spiritual
truths “fully,” but he reminded the Corinthian Christians that “now we see
in a mirror, dimly” and do not have all the final propositions settled (1 Cor-
inthians 13:12). Indeed, grasping this fact about the human condition is a
sign of thinking like an adult and putting away childish ways (13:11).
                                                 Laying Foundations of Faith   71




    Though many people today hunger for a type of scriptural certainty,
learning to live with vital questions and dynamic answers will better pre-
pare us to grow in faith. In our catechism we have suggested that asking  
the right questions is important, though the answers are unfinished. If we
can put the right questions into the hearts of our children, with answers that
guide them toward a dynamic and faithful dialogue with one another, their
teachers, and God, we will nurture disciples whose faith continues to
mature throughout life.
    The brightest times in the catechism class, reports our first teacher    
Sandy Bills, occur when students discuss the questions. Sandy worked very
hard to develop the discussion aspect of the catechism class. The students,
she observes, already have some of the questions rolling around in their
heads and they are waiting for a safe place to ask them. They are excited
about working together and with an adult who takes a child’s thoughts  
seriously. Sandy testifies, as do many teachers of children, that she learns
much from her students; indeed, her discussions with these young theolo-
gians transform how she thinks about her faith.
    The students need a framework on which to hang the truth they are   
discovering. Cindy Salch, our second teacher, has emphasized the memory
work that can provide them a structure for many years of thinking.
p lanning for t h e f u t u re
    We have learned several important lessons over the years as we have
taught “Foundations, Questions and Answers of Our Faith.”5 For one thing,
children love to be considered and treated as important to adults. Some   
students said they were pleased that they were studying their first theology
class! They were grateful that we did not just give them another set of sto-
ries, but called them to reflect more deeply on the stories of their faith. They
were pleased that we gave them “adult things,” such as The Baptist Faith and
Message, and invited them to share their thoughts on God, the Bible, and
other significant matters of faith. Our prayer is that they will continue to
approach learning in this way, that they will remain active in questioning
and discussing and not just passively receive others’ thoughts.
    We have found that there is too much material in our catechism for a
one-year study during the Sunday morning Bible study hour. One option
that we are considering is to enrich the program with short retreats focused
on a BFM article, the Ten Commandments, or the Lord’s Prayer. Another
option is to extend the class to a two-year study, which would allow more
time for discussion that makes for good students and for the memorization
that helps build the foundation for so much future thought.
    Our methods are not without their problems. For instance, we offer the
catechism class on Sunday morning because this is when most families come
to church and we have found that children need to attend class regularly to
grasp the material. Yet many families today, even those who are active in a
72      Catechism




variety of church programs, attend only two Sundays or less each month.
Children are increasingly mobile on weekends, sometimes because their
parents are separated, but often because they enjoy more opportunities for
family travel. Some might attend more regularly if we scheduled the cate-
chism class at another time during the week.
     Though we introduce the parents to our catechism, we would like to
include them more often in the class discussions of the material. Most of  
our parents are not familiar with a Baptist catechism, so they do not truly
understand the learning process that their children are experiencing. If they
were more active in the class, parents would have a wonderful opportunity
to learn theology with and from their children, and they would be more
accountable for helping their children memorize and discuss the catechism
questions and answers outside of class.
     As we continue to teach the catechism to our children, we are consider-
ing how we might study the catechism through the whole congregation. Just
as the Heidelberg Catechism in one edition is divided into sections to be con-
sidered each Lord’s Day throughout the year, our catechism could be incor-
porated into worship services for a year’s study and celebration of faith.
     Too many Christians over the years have recognized the value of memo-
rization and organization of theology through a catechism for us to ignore
this form of discipleship training. We have found that catechesis is a mar-
velous way to lead our children into a lifetime of learning.

          In the ancient discipline of spiritual direction, practical
          guidance for Christian living is offered in the most sensi-
          tive and delicate way. The best spiritual directors are
          both good listeners and active interpreters of God’s
          grace in the life of the individual and of the community.




T
       he ancient Christian discipline of spiritual direction, once confined to
       religious communities, is now used broadly by laypeople. One-on-one
       meetings with a trained director, weekly, monthly, or at longer inter-
vals, may help us to sustain a regular commitment to prayer and to the life
of the Spirit.1 In these meetings we describe our prayer experiences, our joys
and difficulties, and gain perspective on how our spiritual practice may be
shaping us. A spiritual director helps us to develop confidence in God, to
relax in prayer, to deal with trouble spots of any kind. Spiritual direction    
is not entirely professionalized, but there are now many trained directors.
The director should be a person experienced in prayer and able to listen.
    Spiritual direction can become a deeply valued aspect of our prayer-
lives. Sometimes these relationships take on the character of friendships.
However, as long as the direction is in progress, it is good to maintain a  
certain holy distance. It is wise for both parties to keep confidentiality for
everyone’s protection. As with retreats, spiritual direction is a work of the
Holy Spirit, to be honored and treasured as such.
A F or m of Cate c h e s i s
    At first glance it may seem odd to describe spiritual direction as a    
form of catechesis. In Christian history, catechesis, that is to say, Christian
instruction, mostly employs a structured format for teaching fundamental
74       Catechism




doctrine and belief. Such formats have been used to good effect both by
Catholics and Protestants. Though the word “catechesis” and its adjective
“catechetical” are more often used today by Catholics, the development of a
catechism for teaching Christian belief is longstanding among Protestants as
well as Catholics.
    Martin Luther developed two catechisms, one designated as “large”  
and the other as “small.” For the Reformed Churches the Heidelberg Cate-
                                                     chism and the Westminster

                                                     as children. This has been
                                                     supplanted by the recently
published Catechism of the Catholic Church. Certain popular books, like Mere
Christianity by C. S. Lewis, may be, practically speaking, catechetical. Many
published Christian works serve as teaching instruments for conveying and
instilling the fundamentals of Christian belief and practice. Yet by and large
we do not think of spiritual direction as an aspect of catechetical teaching.
    In Christian spiritual direction, guidance is offered for the very practical
business of Christian living, but in a most sensitive and delicate way. The
best spiritual directors are essentially listeners. They wait for the questions
posed to them by the directee, the person who comes seeking such guid-
ance. They remind themselves not to be overly opinionated and never to
lecture or pontificate. Even so they are active interpreters of God’s grace    
in the life of the individual and of the community.
R ai s ing O u r a w arene s s of G od ’ s G ra c e
     One good reason for taking on the practice of spiritual direction is that  
it may help us to become more discerning about God’s work in our lives. In
fact, the entire spiritual life (sometimes referred to as Christian formation)  
is grounded in a willingness to interpret events in the light of grace.
     A good example of how God’s grace may be seen in our lives is through
published spiritual autobiographies and personal accounts of Christian con-
version. C. S. Lewis articulates his life story in Surprised by Joy: The Shape of
My Early Life. In that narrative of his youthful search for God, Lewis names
and describes a number of intense experiences. One of these is in early
childhood, when he feels a keen sense of pleasure and nostalgia which he   
is almost powerless to name. Eventually he comes to call this experience
“joy.” He spends much of his early life chasing this experience, until it  
                                       The Teaching Power of Spiritual Direction   75




eventually leads him to the acknowledgment of God, and finally devotion  
to Jesus Christ. Yet it is easy to see, in his narrative, the difficulty which   
the young Lewis experienced in interpreting his various intense religious
experiences. Although he had been raised a Christian, still he lacked a full
vocabulary of grace. He could not connect his life experience with his
knowledge of Christianity as a religious and philosophical system. This   
difficulty, wherever it may occur, could conceivably be bridged by the  
practice of spiritual direction.
    In my own Christian practice, I have come to understand the vital
importance of interpretation in the Christian life.  Is God speaking to us
through the smallest and most commonplace events of our lives? Often we
are unsure how to listen to and discern the leadings of God. What stands
between us and the experience of God’s grace? Sometimes we are short on
imagination; we have difficulty supposing that God is actually dealing with
us. Just as often our willingness is what is at stake. We must become willing
to interpret the events of our lives in the light of grace.
     An event may occur. It may be large or small. But the magnitude of the
event is not what matters. What really counts is the interpretation we may
place on events, the specific ways we see how God communicates with us.
    When I was in my early twenties I moved from my native New Orleans
to New York City in hopes of pursuing a career. I began to look for a job,
but for many weeks I had little success. Finally, out of a desperate sense of
need, I went into St. Peter’s Lutheran Church on Lexington Avenue and
prayed for a job.
    Within the next twenty-four hours I had a line on a job, a job which was
offered to me within the week. But I was hesitant to interpret this event as
the answer to prayer. I began to think that such a quick “answer to prayer”
might be an aspect of superstitious thinking. I refused, at least for a time,   
to interpret this event in the light of grace.
    A few weeks later I had a second notable experience. The man who had
hired me (with whom I had never had any religious exchanges) organized
an office lunch at a nearby restaurant, with the whole staff in attendance.  
As part of a light and friendly conversation, he suddenly said, “Have you
ever noticed that people pray for things, but they fail to thank God for the
answers they receive in prayer?” I was frankly astonished. It sounded like   
a direct message from God to me, a sort of a reminder to be grateful, even   
a reproof for the thanks I had failed to extend.
    In such a situation, spiritual direction could have been helpful. But in
those days I did not know that such a spiritual practice even existed, nor
how to avail myself of it.
    On my own, however, by careful reflection on what had happened, I got
the message. I had prayed, I had received an answer to prayer, and I had
been too proud to admit it. Finally, on my knees, I expressed my sorrow  
and went to God thankfully in prayer.
76       Catechism




     Many events in our lives—I would venture to say most events—are
capable of a spiritual interpretation. When we hold back from this interpre-
tation, we are underestimating God, and we are depriving ourselves of a
full appreciation of God’s grace.
Kno w ledge of G od I s t h e F ra m e w or k
    Churches and theological institutes exist to provide us with a frame-
work for our faith. They aim to teach us about the nature and the love of
God. Not only do we turn to the Bible as an authority in the life of the Spirit,
but also to trained interpreters—pastors, professors, spiritual writers, and
teachers whom we regard as trustworthy witnesses to the nature and action
of God. These interpreters guide us, through courses of formal instruction
or one-on-one mentoring, to profess our faith, deepen our understanding   
of the gospel, and grow as disciples.2
    In one sense, the profession of faith is one of the most fundamental
aspects of our Christian practice. While this varies among denominations,
almost every church affords us some way to proclaim our faith. Such a pro-
fession may occur when we stand up in church to read Scripture, when we
preach, and when we testify to what God has done in our lives. Many infor-
mal and familiar phrases are really affirmations of what we believe about
the nature of God: “God is so good,” “God is good, all the time,” and “Our
God is an awesome God.” We profess our faith when we pray the Lord’s
Prayer—“For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.
Amen.”—or the Gloria—“Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the
Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world
without end. Amen.”
    The more liturgical churches encourage the recitation of a creed as a
profession of the faith of the community. These creedal formulas are what
remain of a lost Christian unity. All recite the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene
Creed, and even the Athanasian Creed, even though they may not agree on
what constitutes “one holy catholic and apostolic church.” But there is still a
shred of Christian unity in some of their affirmations: “I believe in God the
Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and in Jesus Christ his only
son, Our Lord.”
    Yet, as many believers have noticed, more is needed to apply these
essentials of Christian belief to our day-to-day experience. How should we
relate to God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) on an ongoing basis? How do
we live for God and others? What, to use William James’s expression, is the
“cash value” of our belief? How do we respond to the call of Jesus to take
up the cross and follow him?
    Volumes have been written to answer these questions. But the learning
that takes place in spiritual formation is God’s grace mediated through liv-
ing persons who are our spiritual friends and counselors. This living and
active application of Christian teaching can be invaluable.
                                       The Teaching Power of Spiritual Direction   77




     Sometimes a person comes into spiritual direction wrestling with specif-
ic problems. The director may help him or her to apply the teaching of Jesus
or other biblical wisdom. How do I deal with irritating people who intrude
on my life and make unfair demands on my time? How do I deal with a  
person in my congregation who is constantly against me? “But I say to you,
love your enemies.” How do I appropriate the spirituality of my parents and
grandparents and apply their life lessons to my own experience? “Honor
your father and mother.” What do I do about unanswered prayers? “Then Jesus
told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart…. And he
said, ‘Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God grant justice to his
chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?’”
     In the last several years I have been serving as a spiritual director in a
two-year training program entitled “The Path of Spiritual Direction and
Spiritual Formation in the Congregation.” This series of retreats, sponsored
by the Academy of Spiritual Leadership of the Louisiana Conference of the
United Methodist Church and directed by the Reverend Carole Cotton
Winn, is now being offered for the fourth time. In its brochure, the program
is described as follows: “the scope of the retreats includes the art of training
in spiritual direction, and takes a broader look at bringing the practices of
spiritual formation to the congregation. It is for those who want resources
and skills which invite persons and small groups into the presence of God
and which deepen the spiritual life of the congregation.” Each person
enrolled in these sessions is
expected to have regular
contact with an experienced
spiritual director.                 How do we take up the cross and follow

sessions, is twofold: to do

should do, and do it well;
and to help the directees
reflect on the process in ways that will strengthen them for their own work
in spiritual direction. Is this also a form of catechesis? I suspect so.3
A N e w e x p erien c e of fait h
    Certainly, part of my task as a director in this program is to help form

spiritual principles sparingly and judiciously, and wait for the Holy Spirit.
      More importantly, I notice these directees are developing a new vocabu-
lary for spiritual life. They are devout Christians, long time churchgoers,
practiced in their own style of worship and devotion. Yet such notions as
spiritual formation and spiritual direction demand more of them. And they
are entering into this program on behalf of their own congregations. They
                                                    want to make the spiritual

                                                    is through writing. I am
always careful not to assign writing, but rather to offer it as a one of many
options for spiritual discipline. This desire to write is not stemming from  
me or from my direction. But the directees sometimes keep journals and
refer to them as ways to prepare for their sessions in spiritual direction.
      In some instances, the directees write more organized reflection papers
as part of the training course. I was particularly struck by one of these, in
which the writer reviewed some of the devotional literature that had influ-
enced her parents and showed its influence upon her own life. She also
drew together the spiritual writers who had influenced her, finding the
commonalities between generations.
      Surely this is a learning experience, and one which has benefits both   
for the writer and for others who read her paper. Such an exercise is both
devotional and instructive.
      Henri J. M. Nouwen, in speaking of the spiritual value of writing, said:
“Writing is a process by which we discover what lives in us. The writing
itself reveals to us what lives in us. The deepest satisfaction of writing is
precisely that it opens up new spaces within us of which we were not aware
before we began to write.”4 This is, of course, a form of learning, a faith-
learning in which we may discover the truths of our faith as part of lived
experience.
      In a similar way we learn from our devotional reading, which is often a
real undergirding of our spiritual practice. In addition to the Bible, which is
intimately connected to our spiritual living, many devotional texts, works of
reflection, and faith-narratives nurture our understanding of God.
                                            The Teaching Power of Spiritual Direction     79




    After many years in the spiritual life, I must take note of the various  
factors that have formed me, and how I have progressed spiritually over
time. By and large I cannot calculate this in terms of an increase of virtue,
though I have sometimes hoped for that. Instead I am conscious of a deep-
ening of knowledge, not so much on the intellectual level but rather as a
kind of wisdom. Many factors contribute to this. Prayer, worship, reading,
reflection, writing, and spiritual direction are among them.
    To list here all of the books which have instructed and nurtured me
would be impractical. As an illustration I will mention just one: Teach Us
to Pray: Learning a Little About God, by the Belgian contemplative and scholar
Andre Louf. This small volume came into my hands in the 1970s, and I have
read it countless times. Intended as an instruction on prayer for his fellow
Cistercian monks, Louf’s book has been read with great profit by a large
audience of laypeople, who have been blessed by his vital consciousness    
of the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
    Louf says of the Holy Spirit: “God’s Holy Spirit has taken us over, has
assumed complete possession of us; he has become breath of our breath and
spirit of our spirit. He takes our heart in tow and turns it towards God.” He
adds that prayer, this knowledge given by the Spirit, is like a hidden trea-
sure we always carry about with us. To explain all this he draws especially
on Paul’s encouragement, “For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall
back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry,
‘Abba! Father!’ it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we
are children of God” (Romans 8:15) and “Because you are children, God has
sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!’” (Galatians
4:6). Prayer, he adds, is a heart that overflows with gratitude, thanksgiving,
and praise.5
    Such devotional reading is a vivid encouragement to the spiritual life.
For me, this passage is a splendid footnote to that statement in the Profes-
sion of Faith: “I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who
proceeds from the Father and from the Son.”
    The practice of the spiritual life, including the practice of spiritual direc-
tion, serves to enlarge our knowledge of Christian faith and practice. J. B.
Phillips, the British spiritual writer, once described faith as a faculty which
becomes stronger in practice. So, the spiritual life, heightened by spiritual
direction, is a way of enlarging and strengthening our catechesis.


note s
  1 Group spiritual direction is also practiced, and it observes many of the same sensitivi-
ties and constraints. But the historic method of spiritual guidance is one-on-one.
  2 Among the programs of catechetical training, under Protestant auspices, is Alpha, an
interdenominational training course in the essentials of Christian belief. The Alpha course,
based on a program which originated in Britain, offers ten weeks of training to provide a
“nonthreatening introduction to the Christian faith” (www.alphausa.org). Recently a new
80      Catechism




program, “Why Catholic?” has been launched in American Catholic Churches at the
behest of the RENEW International movement (www.whycatholic.org). In a structured  
small-group process, participants will read and reflect upon the Catechism of the Catholic
Church, which explores the essentials of Christian belief in the Catholic tradition.
   3 One thing that strikes me about this program is the depth and breadth of devotional
literature being recommended and in some instances required. Especially I noticed the
readings from John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Origen.
   The reading list also included a number of modern teachers on the spiritual life:  
William A. Barry and William J. Connolly, The Practice of Spiritual Direction; William A
Barry, Discernment in Prayer: Paying Attention to God; Thomas Green, Weeds Among the
Wheat and Drinking from a Dry Well; and David Regan, “Mystagogy and Experience,”
chapter three in Experience the Mystery: Pastoral Possibilities for Christian Mystagogy.
   Protestant publishers were well represented on the reading list—Upper Room and
InterVarsity Press as well as Westminster/John Knox Press and Pendle Hill Publications.
A number of the recommended authors were Anglicans or Episcopalians. Among these
authorities were Gerald May, Alan Jones, Kenneth Leech, and Michael Gemignani. The
recommended materials were all drawing from well-established and historic practices of
spiritual direction and formation.

          As true catechism challenges us to wrap our minds
          around the mysteries of the faith, it guides us to more
          faithful ways of living. The two approaches reviewed here
          open space in daily life to practice the presence of God,
          not just in the words we say, but in the ways we use our
          hands and feet.




U
         nfortunately, to many Christians catechism seems like a set of ab-
         stract questions and important-sounding answers, a sort of divinely
         sanctioned Scholastic Aptitude Test to guarantee entrance into the
Kingdom of God. “Since the Enlightenment, intellectual knowledge, theolo-
gy, and doctrine have been the primary means by which people come to the
religious life,” Tony Jones notes in a pair of recent books. If he is right, and
if his adverse reaction to this phenomenon is not unique, this might go a
long way toward explaining the general ambivalence about the practice of
catechism among churchgoing Christians today.
     The most committed and faithful practitioners of catechetical instruc-
tion think this characterization misses the mark. They know that the value
of such instruction is in how it can form Christian character rather than just
manipulate ideas. For we are not disembodied souls or fleshless reason, as
the ancient heresy of Gnosticism and its modern counterpart of Enlighten-
ment Rationalism would have us believe. We are skin and bone, arms and
legs, physical matter on two feet walking through this physical world, won-
dering not just what we should think, but what we should do. The question,
then, for those committed to exploring the benefits of traditional catecheti-
cal instruction, is how we might unite the living qualities of Christian prac-
82      Catechism




tice without forsaking substantive doctrinal matters. In training disciples,
how might we challenge one another to wrap our minds around the mys-
teries of the faith, while at the same time spurring one another on to more
faithful ways of life? Better yet, how might we grow to see the two activities
as inextricably connected, or of one piece entirely?
     Recently there has been no shortage of books on Christian practice, all  
of which profess the common goal of helping a Church largely disconnected
from its past rediscover some of the regular activities our predecessors in
the faith embraced as they sought to grow closer to God. The weakest of
these works treat disciplines as mystical formulas, as though simply assum-
ing a certain posture and uttering certain words might serve as a two-step
process to spiritual enlightenment. The strongest, however, seek to open up
space within the patterns of daily life so that believers might practice the
presence of God, not just in the words they say or doctrines they believe,
but in the ways they use their hands and feet. Our work and rest, our shar-
ing of meals and stories and embraces and tears with families and friends
and church communities, are opportunities for us to learn together what it
means to live faithfully under the care of a God who is made known not just
to our minds, but to our whole selves.
re c o v ering t h e tradition
      For those seeking to understand how doctrines and practices firmly
rooted in the past might come alive in the Church today, and specifically
how this might take place across generations of Christians, the work of
Tony Jones is a good place to start. Jones, a former Minnesota youth minis-
ter and a current doctoral candidate in theology at Princeton Theological
Seminary, has something of a vested interest in communicating the signifi-
cance of Christian practice in language that is easily grasped by younger
members of the Church. To this end, in 2003, he published Soul Shaper:
Exploring Spirituality and Contemplative Practices in Youth Ministry (El Cajon,
CA: Youth Specialties, 2003, 253 pp., $19.99). This book, geared primarily
towards men and women committed to the formation of young Christians
into mature followers of Christ, endeavors admirably to bring modern     
disciples, young and old alike, into conversation with practices from the
past that many believers dismiss out of hand as “weird,” “outdated,” or
“superstitious.” Eschewing the stereotypes so often heard in Protestant    
circles especially, Jones manages to ground these practices—which range
from the use of icons and labyrinths to fasting and spiritual direction—in
theological, historical, and personal contexts that make them seem less alien
to us. In short, he gives us eyes to see these things as immensely practicable,
even in the midst of a culture that kicks against the goads of the past with
all its might.
     Consider just one example of how Jones approaches this task. He opens
the chapter on pilgrimage by relating a fellow youth minister’s reflections
     	                                        Learning Life-Giving Ways of Life   83




on a recent trip to Ground Zero in New York City. This serves to illustrate
that we needn’t be mired in medieval images of journeys to Canterbury or
Santiago in order for the practice of pilgrimage to make sense. After sharing
these insights from someone actively and daily engaging in the process of
forming Christians in the twenty-first century, Jones turns to the history
behind pilgrimage, and in the process he helps a past full of spiritual wan-
derers come alive. He describes what a journey to Santiago de Compostela
during the twelfth century would have been like, and helps us understand
the purpose such a journey would serve. In the third section of the chapter,
he explores some of pilgrimage’s theological moorings, such as the convic-
tion that we are resident aliens on this earth, “trying to find our way back  
to that perfect place where our relationship with God is perfectly intimate.”
Indeed, Jones classifies all of life this side of Eden as a wandering, and he
views the practice of pilgrimage as a powerful symbolic reminder of that
reality. What Jones accomplishes, then, over the course of five short pages,
is to connect what we believe with what we do in a way that seems not for-
eign, but rather a part of who we are.
     Every chapter in Jones’ book includes notes on how we might best
engage these practices, such as tips on how best to prepare for a pilgrimage
(leave the Discman and Sports Illustrated at home) or what to expect during
a fast (weakness and muscle soreness will give way to clarity).
     Another Jones publica-
tion, The Sacred Way: Spiri-
tual Practices for Everyday
Life (El Cajon, CA: Youth           Jones gives us eyes to see traditional
Specialties, 2005, 222 pp.,
$12.99), is an updated ver-         Christian practices—from use of icons and
sion of the earlier book, but
it is directed more toward          labyrinths to fasting and spiritual direction—
the formation of adults. The
structure of the book is sim-       as immensely practicable, even in the midst
ilar to that of Soul Shaper,

reflections on youth minis-

chapters in the earlier work
have simply been repro-
duced for a different audience. Both books are valuable introductions to
ancient Christian practices and fruitful meditations on how these practices
might enrich our understanding of who we are as disciples of Jesus Christ.
Neither seeks to disengage from the intellectual or doctrinal aspects of our
identity as Christians, but rather to map out new ways to live into the reali-
ties communicated in the catechisms and creeds of the faith.

R E lating p ra c ti c e s and b elief
     As the director of the Project on the Education and Formation of People
in Faith at Valparaiso University, Dorothy C. Bass is committed to exploring
ways in which the Church might participate in the shaping of Christians.
Her role as editor of two recent books shows that, like Jones, she believes
this business of formation should not be limited to one generation within
the Church. It is never too early or too late to begin the process of growing
in faith and practice.
     Way to Live: Christian Practices for Teens (Nashville, TN: Upper Room
Books, 2002, 310 pp., $16.00), like Jones’ Soul Shaper, is a book that helps
youth and those who minister to them to connect their faith with the strug-
gles, challenges, and opportunities they face every day. Bass co-edited the
book with Don C. Richter, and the chapters were composed by teams of an
adult and a teenager putting their heads together to think faithfully about
prayer, work, time, creativity, play, stuff, and fourteen other pieces of the
puzzle called life. Emerging from these myriad parts is a beautiful whole of
real-world Christian existence, as well as an encouraging picture of youth
and adults developing a common vocabulary as they talk about things that
matter. It is a vocabulary of practice rooted in belief that, if engaged, can
result in a process of forming disciples that is living, active, and deeply
valuable to the Church.
     In the chapter on grieving, for example, teenager Tatiana Wilson, 14,
joins with her aunt, Cheryl Kirk-Duggan, to reflect on the loss of loved ones,
the depth of suffering in the world due to AIDS and other diseases, and the
need for healing in the wake of death. The two frame the conversation in the
context of Scripture, especially the biblical psalms of lament, so that teens
are given an ancient language to express their emotions, a language deeper
and more God-centered than so many of the platitudes that pass for wisdom
in today’s world. Wilson and Kirk-Duggan encourage their audience to find
ways to remember, in word and action, through poetry and heartbreak and
ritual and honesty, the past they might be mourning and the future they
anticipate. Christian doctrines are not forsaken; Christian community is not
denied; Christian practice is not ignored. Instead, we are given a picture of  
a fuller, richer sort of grief than is so often experienced, a grief that young
people can embody practically and in the process find true healing, the kind
of healing that can only be rooted in the truth and beauty of God.
     Another collection of essays edited by Bass, Practicing our Faith: A Way of
Life for a Searching People (San Francisco, CA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997,
232 pp. $18.95), sets out, over the course of fourteen essays, a vision for con-
necting the shared beliefs of Christians with “life giving ways of life.” This
vision is all about practicing what we confess, through the exploration of
such practices as honoring the body, keeping Sabbath, forgiveness, healing,
and discernment.

     An illustration from the book’s essay on hospitality might best articulate
how Christian practice and belief, vocalized through catechism, creed, and
confession, are inextricably linked. The author, Ana Maria Pineda, tells of a
yearly practice in the Mission District of San Francisco known as Las Posa-
das. The ritual unfolds over nine December nights and involves the entire
community. For the first eight nights, various men, women, and children
assume the role of Mary and Joseph and request lodging from innkeepers
stationed at various sites. At each station, those playing the role of the wea-
ry father-to-be ask for a place to stay. At each station, those playing the role
of the innkeeper answer back, “This is not an inn; move on—I cannot open
lest you be a scoundrel.” Finally, on the ninth night, something changes. A
spirit of grace-filled hospitality enters the proceedings, so that Joseph and
his pregnant wife are given lodging for the night, Jesus is born, and the
community celebrates with piñatas, song and dance, and feasting. It is a  
celebration of the ancient innkeeper’s hospitality, as well as a call to open
our doors, our tables, and our hearts to the wandering strangers in our own
midst.
     This is what catechism and practice should be about; we enter into a
harmonious exchange as belief and action both come alive among us. God’s
methods are many; throughout our lives, that same God who moved the
innkeeper to hospitably welcome a wandering couple into his stable forms
us into citizens of the Kingdom, so that through profession and practice we
might become the people, and the disciples, we were intended to be.

             How much of Christian teaching should be explanation
             and how much example? Without denying the significance
             of words, the books reviewed here explore the neglected
             significance of worship and everyday practices in shaping
             the hearts and minds of growing believers.




I
    n passing along the faith to the next generation of church members,   
    how much of Christian teaching should be explanation and how much
    example? Is the faith best described or best performed? Are we most
persuaded by word or by deed? Without denying the significance of words,
many recent authors of books about doctrine and catechism emphasize the
neglected significance of liturgical and everyday practice in shaping the
minds and bodies of growing believers.
    Perhaps the best explanation for this turn to the performative in theories
of catechism can be found in a massive new volume on theological method
which argues that doctrine can best be conceived as a drama—a stage on
which the enactment of Scripture unfolds in the life of the Church. In his
book, The Drama of Doctrine (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press,
2005, 488 pp., $39.95), Kevin Vanhoozer, Research Professor of Systematic
Theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, relies extensively on the
work of Catholic theologian Han Urs von Balthasar to develop the claim
that “what lies at the heart of gospel is not an idea or an ideal or an experi-
ence, but an action” (p. 50).
    Vanhoozer positions his work at the edge of changing understandings
about the meaning of doctrine. Specifically he seeks to offer an evangelical
alternative to postliberal Protestant theology, which, following George
Lindbeck, had emphasized the story-shaped nature of doctrine and that
                                      Catechism in the Worshiping Community   87




beliefs are shaped by particular cultures where Christians live. While this
was a useful corrective to the didactic and propositional theology of the
Enlightenment era, Vanhoozer is rightly concerned that the transformative
and world-challenging gospel event is compromised by such a relativizing
approach. Vanhoozer seeks to recover the sense in which God’s actions in
the world through Israel, Jesus Christ, and the Church are both events to
which members of Christ may witness and also words by which believers
may extend those gracious acts.
    Much of his book is devoted to working out what it would mean for
theological method to understand the Church as a “theater of the gospel”
with its members a “company of performers” (p. 413). The diligent and
patient reader will discover a profound reorientation to such persistent
ecclesial issues such as authority, leadership, tradition, and biblical inter-
pretation. Toward the end of the book Vanhoozer draws on acting theory to
sketch out some of the practical implications of his method for those practic-
es of Word and Sacrament by which believers are formed into their roles as
members of Christ so that they may become martyrs—witnesses to the grace
of God revealed in the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Yet
Vanhoozer’s greatest gift is his provision of a new conceptual landscape for
doing theology, for performing it, and for passing it along to others.
c ate c h e s i s t h ro u g h w or s h i p
    The drama of doctrine as conceived by Vanhoozer offers a rich theoreti-
cal backdrop for reading several other more practically focused books con-
cerned with the relationship between worship and catechism. Simon Chan’s
new Liturgical Theology: The Church as Worshiping Community (Downers
Grove, IL: Intervarsity Press, 2006, 207 pp., $22.00), for example, proceeds
from a strong doctrine of the Church to an eloquent, if not always elegant,
articulation of those practices by which the Church makes visible the will   
of God. For Chan, who is the Earnest Lau Professor of Systematic Theology
at Trinity Theological College in Singapore, the Church is not merely an
instrument for accomplishing God’s purposes but is itself the “expression  
of God’s ultimate purpose” (p. 21). In other words, the Church precedes  
creation and is also the culmination of creation. Chan seeks in this work     
to correct a weak evangelical doctrine of the Church by highlighting the
neglected arts and habits of Christian worship that make the body of Christ
visible in time and space. These arts, Chan emphasizes, are not to be seen as
tactics for the creation of a certain spiritual experience for members. Rather,
the habits of worship cultivated by the Church over the centuries are them-
selves the doxological fulfillment of the Church’s mission (or of God’s mis-
sion in the Church). Put another way, it is in worship that the people of God
become who they are in service to God.
    Chan’s approach raises questions about a variety of conventional evan-
gelical practices that tend to separate the worship of God from the mission
88       Catechism




of the Church. For example, evangelism is often construed as a human-   
centered, purposive program for saving souls. Church-planters use market
analysis to design programs that will attract a certain target audience. And
mega-churches design a whole variety of services for their members orient-
ed around therapeutic, social, and physical needs.
    For Chan, worship should be shaped less by pragmatic goals associated
with evangelism or mission and more by the liturgical norms of Word and
                                                  Sacrament. This two-dimen-

                                                  reign of God; the Eucharis-
cipleship can be addressed vigorously.            tic meal makes that reign
                                                  visible in the present. Such
                                                  a reevaluation of Commu-
nion should be taken seriously by evangelicals who have “created a largely
hearing community rather than an aural-tactile community” (p. 67).
    The incorporation of new members into the Church cannot be separated
from this multi-dimensional worship, according to Chan. Catechism must
involve basic elements of liturgy and thus prepare candidates for member-
ship to participate rightly in worship of God’s people. Traditional catechism
has thus focused on three activities: the confession of the triune God in the
creed, following the Ten Commandments, and praying the Lord’s Prayer.
Within such a framework many contemporary issues of discipleship can be
addressed vigorously. For example, the creed helps us to address a world  
of religious pluralism. The Commandments speak to us against the grain    
of market-centered consumer capitalism. The Lord’s Prayer challenges an
exchange-focused economy that breeds poverty and homelessness. Chan’s
book develops practical proposals for both teaching and worship, including
a rough outline of contemporary issues to be addressed through liturgy-
centered catechesis and a sample order of worship.

    If Chan offers a provocative critique of much contemporary evangelical
worship and teaching, Debra Dean Murphy takes on the liberal Protestant
establishment in a book that, like Chan, embeds catechesis in worship, while
focusing on catechesis rather than on worship. Murphy works for both the
academy and the church—teaching at Meredith College and directing the
Christian education program at the 1500 member Fuquay-Varina United

Methodist Church in North Carolina.
    Murphy’s book, Teaching That Transforms: Worship as the Heart of Chris-
tian Education (Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, 2007, 255 pp., $26.00), begins
with a critique of modern religious education programs that abstract the
values they inculcate from the particular faith traditions in which they had
been embedded. She is further opposed to any kind of public theology that
seeks to reduce Christian particularity to commonly held civic virtues such
as freedom and justice. Instead she seeks to return to the kind of freedom
discovered through dependence on the gifts of the Triune God and through
the same kind of obedience to the Father that Jesus displayed. Thus, Mur-
phy is critical of the public ethos of liberal Protestant churches that accepts
the terms of American civil religion as a basis for social activism and
humanitarian giving.
    Murphy establishes an agenda for Christian catechesis that instead of
making church members into polite and contributing citizens will rather
identify them with the countercultural community of the Church and with
alternative ways of knowing that are rooted in the counter-story of Jesus—
the “way things really are” (p. 92). As Murphy develops those practices of
knowledge in the second half of her book, she emphasizes like Chan the
engagement of the whole body in Christian formation through worship.
Unlike Chan she stresses the centrality of desire in Christian knowing—in
the Augustinian sense of human longing that rightly finds its fulfillment in
God. This attention to the power of God-directed human desire provides a
dimension of intensity and beauty to Murphy’s discussion of the bodily
actions of the liturgy: proclamation, baptism, and Eucharist. Murphy wants
these sensuous liturgical practices to be intrinsic to the training of church
members and for the sharp division between basement education and sanc-
tuary worship to be subverted.
    Chan and Murphy assume that the best way for the Church to form its
members is through the ancient traditions and habits of the Church. Their
approach can perhaps best be described as a recovery of orthodoxy against
the corrosions of modern and postmodern assimilation. At the same time,
these projects give little attention to the corrosions of empire and cultural
assimilation that plagued Christianity during the development and inscrip-
tion of orthodoxy—for example in the third and fourth centuries as well as
in the High Middle Ages. It does finally seem unlikely to me that the rituals,
dramas, and recitations associated with classical liturgy can by themselves
carry the weight of countercultural witness to the reign of God amidst the
ruins of the fading world. For Christians to be truly shaped into the life and
mind of Christ, they must break down not just the division between base-
ment education and sanctuary worship but also the barrier between the
gathered and the scattered body. This might mean that the ritualistic styliza-
tions of classical liturgy might be deconstructed a bit, just as the worship of
daily work might be privileged as holy. For example, might the original
90       Catechism




meaning of the Supper of the Lord—a shared meal that followed the pattern
of Jesus’ radical insistence on breaking bread with sinners and tax collectors
(and including even the betrayer, Judas, during that last table gathering)—
offer clues for a more fitting and accessible initiation of Christian hospitality
in daily life? And are there other practices of the Church—the discussions
that accompany the development and acceptance of the annual church   
budget, for example—that might properly be conceived of as liturgical acts?

                                                        For an orientation to
creeds, Shenk focuses on embodied practices        Christian education that
                                                   assumes that practices of
of discipleship such as rejection of the sword     discipleship are as signifi-
and oaths, reading and discussing Scripture,       cant, if not more so, than
                                                   the classical liturgical habits
faithful family life, and voluntary service.       in developing countercul-
                                                   tural Christians, readers
                                                   might turn to the work of
Sara Wenger Shenk, who is Associate Professor of Christian Education at
Eastern Mennonite Seminary in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In Anabaptist Ways
of Knowing: A Conversation about Tradition-Based Critical Education (Telford,
PA: Cascadia Publishing House, 2003, 211 pp., $21.95), she gives attention to
those practices that have been central to Anabaptist self-understanding and
social embodiment. For Shenk, theological knowledge cannot be abstracted
from embodied discipleship; yet the embodied practices she focuses on are
not so much the recitation of classical creeds or the weekly Eucharist but
such mundane and practical acts of Christian discipleship as rejection of   
the sword and oaths, reading and discussing Scripture, faithful family life,
and voluntary service (pp. 152-156).
    Rather than posing radical Christian knowledge against the modern
project, Shenk places Anabaptist traditions of formation in dialogue with
feminist scholarship, post-liberal theology and philosophy, and classical
Christian orthodoxy. By organizing her book as such a dialogue among con-
versation partners, she enacts a crucial practice in radical Christian knowing
that is largely overlooked by Chan and Murphy: discussion of Scripture by
the believing body under the direction of the Holy Spirit.
    While Chan and Murphy are rightly concerned that the Church regains
the liturgical authority to actually accomplish the conversion of individuals
from the cultural power of consumer capitalism and nationalist imperialism,
Shenk is also concerned that the Church itself remains vulnerable to conver-
sion and transformation. In this concern for a critical retrieval of ecclesial
habits of formation, she shares the stage with Kevin Vanhoozer, who seeks

to make not the Church’s reiteration of cultural difference but the Church’s
performance of Scripture the central act of communication by which the
reign of God is made known.
    A missing scene of the biblical drama, then, which Shenk’s work begins
to rescue, is the transformative potential of discussing our disagreements.
As the rabbis have taught us, and as Jesus himself showed, there is nothing
more intensely liturgical or worshipful than an animated argument about
the proper response of the gathered body to the received Word of God. Of
such drama, too, is radical conversion made.

  Psalm 86. Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. Preserve my soul; for I am
holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee
daily. Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. For thou, Lord, art good,
and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Give ear, O LORD, unto my
prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou
wilt answer me. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto
thy works. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify
thy name. For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. Teach me thy way, O LORD; I
will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart:
and I will glorify thy name for evermore. For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul
from the lowest hell. O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought
after my soul; and have not set thee before them. But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and
gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give
thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. Show me a token for good; that they
which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. Isaiah

because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my
flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One
to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there
are pleasures for evermore. Psalm 144:15. Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that

all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
concerning me. 1 Corinthians 2:13. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom

words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the
Lord and Saviour.... And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother
Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; As also in all his epistles, speaking
in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and
unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure,
enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true
and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than
honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great
reward. Isaiah 8:20. To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because

on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt yourselves,
and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, The likeness of
any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, The likeness of any thing
that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: And lest thou lift

spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed

Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. Psalm 145:3. Great is the LORD, and

given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all
things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world,

said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: Who by the
mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The
kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. For

earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained

heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; What is man, that thou
art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; The

the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of
the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.... And the LORD God said unto the woman,
What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 2 Corinthians
11:3. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be
corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

41
  Romans 5:12-21. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed
                                                        (7)
when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned
after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the
offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one
that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences
unto justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive
abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) Therefore as by
the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the
free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made
sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Moreover the law entered, that the offence
might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: That as sin hath reigned unto death,
even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. 1 Corinthians
15:22. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
42
  Genesis 3:16-19, 23. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree,
of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out
of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.... Therefore the LORD God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. Romans 3:16. Destruction and
misery are in their ways: Romans 5:12. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: Ephesians 2:1. And you hath he quickened,
who were dead in trespasses and sins.
43
  Romans 5:12, 19. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.... For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners,
so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
44
  Romans 3:10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: Colossians 3:10. And have put on the
new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: Ephesians 4:24. And that
ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
45
  Psalm 51:5. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. John 3:6. That
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Romans 3:18. There is no
fear of God before their eyes. Romans 8:7-8. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Ephesians 2:3. Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
46
  Genesis 6:5. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Psalm 53:1-3. The fool hath said in his heart, There is
no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good. God looked
down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Matthew 15:19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
witness, blasphemies: Romans 3:10-18, 23. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are
together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre;
                                                         (8)
with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the
way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes.... For all have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God; Galatians 5:19-21. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I
tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God. James 1:14-15. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth
death.
47
  Genesis 3:8, 24. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day:
and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
garden.... So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming
sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. John 8:34, 42, 44. Jesus answered them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.... Jesus said unto them, If God
were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but
he sent me.... Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from
the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he
speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. Ephesians 2:12. That at that time ye were without
Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having
no hope, and without God in the world: Ephesians 4:18. Having the understanding darkened, being alienated
from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.
48
  John 3:36. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not
see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. Romans 1:18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Ephesians 2:3.
Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. Ephesians 5:6. Let no
man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience.
49
  Galatians 3:10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. Revelation
22:3. And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants
shall serve him.
50
  Genesis 3:16-19. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree,
of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out
of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Job 5:7. Yet man is born unto trouble,
as the sparks fly upward. Ecclesiastes 2:22-23. For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. Romans 8:18-23. For I reckon that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest
expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made
subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, Because the
                                                        (9)
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only
they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
51
  Ezekiel 18:4. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the
soul that sinneth, it shall die. Romans 5:12. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: Romans 6:23. For the wages of sin is
death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
52
  Matthew 25:41, 46. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.... And these shall go away into everlasting punishment:
but the righteous into life eternal. 2 Thessalonians 1:9. Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction
from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; Revelation 14:9-11. And the third angel
followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in
his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out
without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up
for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever
receiveth the mark of his name.
53
  Acts 13:48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as
many as were ordained to eternal life believed. Ephesians 1:4-5. According as he hath chosen us in him
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having
predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of
his will, 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved
of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
and belief of the truth: Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
54
  Genesis 3:15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it
shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Genesis 17:7. And I will establish my covenant between
me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee. Exodus 19:5-6. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall
be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel. Jeremiah 31:31-34. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made
with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my
covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: But this shall be the covenant
that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no
more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know
me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I
will remember their sin no more. Matthew 20:28. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 1 Corinthians 11:25. After the same manner also he
took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye
drink it, in remembrance of me. Hebrews 9:15. And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they
which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
                                                      (10)
55
  John 14:6. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but
by me. Acts 4:12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved. 1 Timothy 2:5-6. For there is one God, and one mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

begotten thee. Matthew 3:17. And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased. Matthew 17:5. While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a
voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. John
1:18. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him.

shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The

flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth. Galatians 4:4. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of
a woman, made under the law
58
   Acts 1:11. Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus,
which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
Hebrews 7:24-25. But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he
is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
intercession for them.
59
  Philippians 2:7. But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of men: Hebrews 2:14, 17. Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the
power of death, that is, the devil.... Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,
that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the
sins of the people.
60
  Luke 1:27, 31, 35. To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the
virgin's name was Mary.... And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt
call his name JESUS.... And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the Son of God.
61
   2 Corinthians 5:21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him. Hebrews 4:15. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 7:26. For
such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens; 1 John 3:5. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
62
  Deuteronomy 18:18. I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put
my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. Acts 2:33. Therefore
being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he
hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. Acts 3:22-23. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A

                                                      (11)
prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all
things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that
prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Hebrews 1:1-2. God, who at sundry times and in divers
manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds
63
  Hebrews 4:14-15. Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the
Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 5:5-6. So
also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec.
64
   Isaiah 9:6-7. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his
shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of
David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth
even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. Luke 1:32-33. He shall be great, and shall be
called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he
shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. John 18:37. Pilate
therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was
I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of
the truth heareth my voice. 1 Corinthians 15:25. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
feet.
65
  Luke 4:18-19, 21. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of
sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.... And he
began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. Acts 1:1-2. The former treatise have I
made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, Until the day in which he was taken up,
after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
Hebrews 2:3. How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by
the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him
66
  John 15:26-27. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness,
because ye have been with me from the beginning. Acts 1:8. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. 1 Peter 1:11. Searching what, or what manner of time the
Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the
glory that should follow.
67
  John 4:41-42. And many more believed because of his own word; And said unto the woman, Now we
believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ,
the Saviour of the world. John 20:30-31. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
68
  Isaiah 53. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall
grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
                                                      (12)
when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a
man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and
we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him
stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep
have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison
and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for
the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD to
bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed,
he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail
of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear
their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the
strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he
bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. Acts 8:32-35. The place of the scripture
which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth: In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his
generation? for his life is taken from the earth. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of
whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth, and
began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. Hebrews 9:26-28. For then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put
away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the
second time without sin unto salvation. Hebrews 10:12. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for
sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God
69
  Romans 5:10-11. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but we also joy in God through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 2 Corinthians 5:18. And all things
are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
reconciliation; Colossians 1:21-22. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.
70
   Romans 8:34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is
even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Hebrews 7:25. Wherefore he is able also
to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
them. Hebrews 9:24. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of
the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.
71
   Psalm 110:3. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the
womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. Matthew 28:18-20. And Jesus came and spake unto
them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
Amen. John 17:2. As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as
thou hast given him. Colossians 1:13. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.
                                                      (13)
72
   Psalm 2:6-9. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the LORD hath
said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod
of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Psalm 110:1-2. The LORD said unto my Lord,
Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The LORD shall send the rod of thy
strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Matthew 12:28. But if I cast out devils by the
Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 1 Corinthians 15:24-26. Then cometh the end,
when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule
and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is death. Colossians 2:15. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show
of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
73
  Luke 2:7. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in
a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. 2 Corinthians 8:9. For ye know the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty
might be rich. Galatians 4:4. But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a

things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,

no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of
Christ. Ephesians 2:8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of

him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore
that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. Acts 16:14. And a certain woman named
Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord

in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Ephesians 1:5. Having predestinated us unto the

   Romans 4:6-8. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth

covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 2 Corinthians 5:19. To wit, that God was
in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed

be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: Romans 5:19. For as by one man's
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
life.... Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
henceforth we should not serve sin.... Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it
in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield
yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under
grace. 2 Corinthians 7:1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all

hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
just and unjust.
109
   1 Corinthians 15:42-43. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in

God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his

adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
116
   Matthew 22:37-40. Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

am holy. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work,
pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

thee off for ever. Isaiah 45:20-25. Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of
the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that
cannot save. Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from
ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a
just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely,
shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

   Romans 1:20-21. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in
their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
123
  Psalm 81:10-11. I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth

the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs
toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the
east. Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that
they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have
returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. Therefore will I also deal in fury:
mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will
I not hear them. Romans 1:25. Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the

126
   Exodus 20:4-6. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down
thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And showing mercy unto
thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Deuteronomy 5:8-10. Thou shalt not make
thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or

on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt yourselves,
and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, The likeness of
any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, The likeness of any thing
that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: And lest thou lift
up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of
heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all
nations under the whole heaven. Romans 1:22-23. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And

other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this
place with the blood of innocents; They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire
for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:
Colossians 2:18-23. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of
angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, And not
holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit
together, increaseth with the increase of God. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? Which things have
indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the
satisfying of the flesh.

and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, Psalm 96:9-10. O worship the LORD in the

Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was
refreshed.

is within thy gates: Nehemiah 13:15-22. In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens,
which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they
sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on
the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said
unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did
not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning
the sabbath. And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I
commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath:
and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. So
the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against
them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that
time forth came they no more on the sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my

turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight,
the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee

the LORD hath spoken it.

hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him,
Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day. But he said unto them, Have ye
not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; How he entered into the
house of God, and did eat the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were
with him, but only for the priests? Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in
the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than
the temple. But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have
condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day. And when he was departed
thence, he went into their synagogue: And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they
asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. And he said unto
them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
lawful to do well on the sabbath days. Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it
forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee

the LORD hath spoken it. Amos 8:4-6. Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of
the land to fail, Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we
may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

had lost.... And he said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give
me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the
younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance
with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be
in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed
swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto
him. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and
to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy
hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw
him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I
have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said
to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: For this my son was dead, and is
alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. Now his elder son was in the field: and as
he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and
asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the
fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore
came his father out, and entreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve
thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
make merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with
harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is
alive again; and was lost, and is found. Romans 12:15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with
them that weep. Philippians 2:4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others.

   1 Corinthians 10:10. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the
destroyer. James 3:14-16. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not
against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where
envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.

    Genesis 8:21. And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again
curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither
will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. Romans 3:9 ff., 23. What then? are we better
than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; As
it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth
good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of
asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood:
Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of
God before their eyes.... For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God
174
   Ezekiel 8:6, 13, 15. He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great
abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn
thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.... He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou
shalt see greater abominations that they do.... Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. Matthew 11:20-24. Then began he to
upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee,
Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted
unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been
done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for
the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. John 19:11. Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no

cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. Colossians
3:16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in

to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also
which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all
179
   John 20:30-31. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not
written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and
that believing ye might have life through his name. Galatians 2:15-16. We who are Jews by nature, and not
sinners of the Gentiles, Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the
works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. Philippians 3:3-11. For we are the
circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
flesh. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he
might trust in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; Concerning zeal, persecuting the church;
touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gain to me, those I counted
loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power
of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; If by any
means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and

thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
and be clear when thou judgest. Joel 2:13. And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the

the evil. Luke 15:7, 10. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,

was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the
LORD my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my
thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. Luke 1:16-17.

will heal their land. Psalm 119:57-64. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
words. I entreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. I thought on
my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy
commandments. The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. At midnight I
will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. I am a companion of all them that fear
thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.

with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Acts 2:41-42. Then they that gladly received his

them to understand the reading. And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and

not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. Acts 20:32. And now,
brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you

whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how
shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How
beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they
have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 2 Timothy 3:15-17. And that from a child thou hast known the
holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
186
    Deuteronomy 6:16 ff. Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. Ye shall
diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he

be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
fathers, Psalm 119:18. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 1 Peter 2:1-

2:10. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love
of the truth, that they might be saved. Hebrews 4:2. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto
them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. James
1:22-25. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer
of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth
himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into
the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
man shall be blessed in his deed.

   1 Corinthians 3:7. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that
giveth the increase. Cf. 1 Corinthians 1:12-17. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and
I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; Lest any
should say that I had baptized in mine own name. And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
know not whether I baptized any other. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with
wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
189

the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Matthew 26:26-28. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed
it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and

is shed for many for the remission of sins. Mark 14:22-25. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and

vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. Luke 22:19-20. And he took bread, and gave
thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood,
which is shed for you. 1 Corinthians 1:22-26. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For ye see
your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are
called.
190
   Galatians 3:27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 1 Corinthians
10:16-17. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread
which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one
body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it,
and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same
manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do
ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
show the Lord's death till he come.
193
   Matthew 28:19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of

194
   Acts 2:38-42. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,
and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many
other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that
gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand

prayers. Acts 22:16. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on
the name of the Lord. Romans 6:3-4. Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Galatians
3:26-27. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized
into Christ have put on Christ. 1 Peter 3:21. The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.
195
   Acts 2:41. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added
unto them about three thousand souls. Acts 8:12, 36, 38. But when they believed Philip preaching the things

Christ: Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of
God, who hath raised him from the dead.
197
   Luke 22:19-20. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my
body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This

for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,

198
   1 Corinthians 10:16-17. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of

unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh

damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are
chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

is a refuge for us. Selah. Matthew 7:7-8. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that

shall receive, that your joy may be full.
203
   Psalm 32:5-6. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess
my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. For this shall every one
that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him. Daniel 9:4-19. And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my
confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love
him, and to them that keep his commandments; We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have
done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: Neither
have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and
our fathers, and to all the people of the land. O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us
confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel,
that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their
trespass that they have trespassed against thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. To the Lord our God belong mercies and
forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our
God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. Yea, all Israel have
transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured
upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against
him. And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by
bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon
Jerusalem. As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer
before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. Therefore hath
the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works
which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we
have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury
be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our
fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. Now therefore, O our God,
hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate, for the Lord's sake. O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. 1 John 1:9. If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

   Psalm 103:1-5. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the
LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender
mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. Psalm 136.
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks unto the God of
gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever. To
him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that by wisdom made the
heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy
endureth for ever. To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever: The sun to rule by day: for
his mercy endureth for ever: The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him
that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever: And brought out Israel from among
them: for his mercy endureth for ever: With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy
endureth for ever. To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever: And made
Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever: But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in
the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever. To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
mercy endureth for ever. To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: And slew famous
kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever: And Og
the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever: And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy
endureth for ever: Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever. Who
remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever: And hath redeemed us from our enemies:
for his mercy endureth for ever. {25} Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. {26} O
give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever. Philippians 4:6. Be careful for nothing;
but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Cf.
Luke 11:11-13. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a
fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then,
being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? Romans 8:15. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

pleasure they are and were created.

    Matthew 12:25-28. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against
itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: And if Satan cast
out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils
by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. Romans 16:20. And the God of peace shall
bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. 1 John 3:8. He

LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. Psalm 119. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the
law of the LORD. Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. They
also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. O that
my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
commandments. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous
judgments. I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly, etc. 1 Thessalonians 5:23. And the very God of
peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto

   Proverbs 30:8-9. Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with
food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal,
and take the name of my God in vain. Matthew 6:31-34. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we
eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles
seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom
of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the
morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
Philippians 4:11, 19. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
therewith to be content.... But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ
Jesus. 1 Timothy 6:6-8. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this
world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and

snow.... Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Daniel 9:17-19. Now therefore, O our
God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that
is desolate, for the Lord's sake. O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. 1 John 1:7. But if we
walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
Son cleanseth us from all sin.
222
    Matthew 18:21-35. Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and
I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until
seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take
account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten
thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and
children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him,
saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with
compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his
                                                      (36)
fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat,
saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have
patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should
pay the debt. So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto
their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant,
I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till
he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from
your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. Ephesians 4:32. And be ye kind one to
another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Colossians
3:13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as
Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

   Psalm 19:13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me:
then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. Matthew 26:41. Watch and pray,
that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. John 17:15. I pray not
that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
224
    Luke 22:31-32. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may
sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren. 1 Corinthians 10:13. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation
also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. 2 Corinthians 12:7-9. And lest I should be exalted
above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord
thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ
may rest upon me. Hebrews 2:18. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
them that are tempted.
225
    Daniel 9:4, 7-9, 16-19. And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O
Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that
keep his commandments.... O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at
this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that
are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have
trespassed against thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our
fathers, because we have sinned against thee. To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though
we have rebelled against him.... O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger
and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the
iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. Now
therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon
thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications
before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord,
hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
Luke 18:1, 7-8. And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to
faint.... And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with
them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find
faith on the earth?

   1 Chronicles 29:10-13. Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said,
Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the
power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine;
thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of thee,
and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to
give strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 1 Timothy
1:17. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and
ever. Amen. Revelation 5:11-13. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne
and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
thousands; Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on
the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and
ever.

   1 Corinthians 14:16. Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of
the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? Revelation
22:20. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
